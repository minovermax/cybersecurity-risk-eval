{"cik": "1472343", "company": "Roka BioScience, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to the Commercialization of Our Products\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument to achieve or sustain profitability.\nCurrently, we rely solely on the commercialization of our Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument to generate revenue. We believe that our commercialization success is dependent upon our ability to significantly increase the number of customers that are using our products. We achieved our first commercial sales in late 2012 and have experienced limited revenue and customer adoption to date. In addition, demand for our Atlas products may not increase as quickly as planned and we may be unable to increase our revenue levels as expected. We are currently not profitable and even if we succeed in increasing adoption of our Atlas solution by the food safety testing market, maintaining and creating relationships with our existing and new customers and developing and commercializing additional molecular testing products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, our inability to achieve or sustain profitability could result in future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable and if such assets are found to be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss or significant reduction in business with key customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nWe have a limited number of customers and have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a subset of these customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top two customers, Marshfield Food Safety, LLC, and PrimusLabs, accounted for an aggregate of 50% of our total revenue. Each of these customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the period. We do not have any long term contracts and our customer contracts are terminable at will by either party. The complete loss of, or significant reduction in business from these key customers or any significant future customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nOur Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market products that are recognized in the food safety testing market as accurate, rapid and cost-effective. Most of our potential customers currently use molecular or immunochemical testing methods and may be reluctant to change those methods to a new technology. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince potential customers that our Atlas solution is an attractive alternative to existing molecular and immunochemical testing systems. We will need to demonstrate that our products provide accurate, time saving and cost-effective alternatives to existing testing methods. Compared to most competing technologies, our molecular technology is relatively new, and most potential customers have limited knowledge of, or experience with, our products. Prior to adopting our solution, potential customers are required to devote significant time and effort to testing and validating our Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument. In addition, during the implementation phase, customers may be required to devote significant time and effort to training their personnel on appropriate laboratory practices to ensure accurate results due to the highly sensitive nature of our assays. Any failure of our Atlas solution to meet benchmarks or expectations of potential or existing customers could result in an inability to obtain new business or the loss of current business.\nMany factors influence the perception of a system, including its use by leaders in the industry, such as major food processors, third-party food safety testing laboratories, government agencies and thought leaders. If we are unable to continue to move major food processors, third-party food safety testing laboratories and thought leaders in the food safety testing market to adopt our Atlas solution, acceptance and adoption of our products could be slowed. In addition, if our products fail to gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and we are unable to expand our customer base, we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur sales cycle is lengthy and variable, which makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and other operating results.\nThe sales cycle for our Atlas solution is lengthy and unpredictable, which makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast revenues in a given period, and may cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. Most of our potential customers currently use molecular or immunochemical testing methods and we need to persuade potential customers to change their testing methods and adopt our Atlas solution. These customers may be reluctant to change those methods to a new testing method or may delay any decisions to change their testing methods. Potential customers for our\nproducts typically need to commit significant time and resources to evaluate the technology used in our products and their decision to purchase our products may be further limited by budgetary constraints and numerous layers of internal review and approval, which are beyond our control. We spend substantial time and effort assisting potential customers in evaluating our Atlas solution, including providing demonstrations and validation on the food types that they test. Even then, customers may decide to continue to evaluate our Atlas solution and delay any decision to change their testing methods. Furthermore, even after initial approval by appropriate decision makers, the negotiation and documentation processes for the actual adoption of our Atlas solution can be lengthy. As a result of these factors, based on our experience to date, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a prospective customer to routine commercial utilization of our Atlas Detection Assays, has varied considerably and can often be 12 months or longer, which has made it difficult for us to accurately project revenues and other operating results. In addition, the revenue generated from sales of our Atlas Detection Assays may fluctuate from time to time due to changes in the testing volumes of our customers. As a result, our financial results may fluctuate on a quarterly basis which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our product and we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe sell our Atlas solution through our own direct sales force. We have limited experience in marketing and selling these products, which had their formal commercial launch in late 2012. In addition, our assays and instrument are a new technology to the food safety testing market. Our future sales will depend in large part on our ability to increase our marketing efforts and adequately address our customers\u2019 needs. The food safety testing industry is a large and diverse market. As a result, we believe it is necessary to maintain a sales force that includes sales representatives with specific technical backgrounds that can support our customers\u2019 needs. We will also need to attract and develop sales and marketing personnel with industry expertise. Competition for such employees is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain sufficient personnel to maintain an effective sales and marketing force. If we are unable to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, it could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nWe commenced our commercial launch in late 2012 and anticipate growth in our business operations. Since our inception in 2009, we have increased our number of employees to 90 as of December 31, 2016 and we may increase our number of employees further as our business grows. This future growth could create strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including laboratory operations, quality control, customer service and sales and marketing. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. If our current infrastructure is unable to handle our growth, we may need to expand our infrastructure and staff and implement new reporting systems. The time and resources required to implement such expansion and systems could adversely affect our operations. Our expected future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this potential future growth effectively, without compromising quality.\nIf we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve or sustain profitability.\nThe food safety testing industry is highly competitive and we face competition from companies that offer molecular, immunochemical and culture testing products. In order to achieve market acceptance for our products, we may be required to demonstrate that our products provide accurate, cost-effective and time saving alternatives to traditional testing platforms and products made by our competitors.\nKey competitors offering molecular pathogen testing solutions include Hygiena, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Merck KGaA, Life Technologies Corporation, Sample6 Technologies and 3M Food Safety. Key competitors offering immunochemical testing solutions include bioM\u00e9rieux, S.A. and Neogen Corporation. Key competitors offering culture testing solutions include 3M, bioM\u00e9rieux and Neogen. These companies compete with us primarily on the basis of technology, quality, reputation, accuracy, ease of use, price, reliability, range of product offerings, including the ability to offer a broader range of testing methods than we can offer, the timing of new product introductions and product line offerings. Our existing competitors or new market entrants may be in a better position than we are to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies, may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, may adopt more aggressive pricing strategies and may be more successful in attracting potential customers. Many of our existing competitors or new market entrants have, or may have, significantly greater financial, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and technological resources than we do. Additionally, these companies may have substantially greater expertise in conducting research and development, greater ability to obtain necessary\nintellectual property and greater brand recognition than we do, any of which may adversely affect our ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy\nIf our products do not perform as expected, whether as a result of operator error or otherwise, it would impair our operating results and reputation.\nOur success depends on the food safety market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality molecular food safety testing products. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and operator errors, including if our assays fail to accurately detect pathogens in food samples or if the failure to detect pathogens leads to a product recall. In addition, our reputation and the reputation of our products can be adversely affected if our assays fail to perform as expected, which performance could be negatively impacted by failure to adopt or modify laboratory practices and processes to support the adoption of our solution, errors made by operators of the Atlas instrument, or if such operators improperly prepare their testing samples or fail to properly enrich them. For example, while we have many customers who have adopted our assays without incident, particularly when sufficient resources have been allocated to training personnel and good laboratory practices and our recommended processes have been appropriately implemented, in the spring of 2014, several of our customers experienced sporadic false positive test results due to sample contamination in their early-stage implementation of our Listeria assay, primarily in connection with environmental testing. In collaboration with our customers, we developed revised sample workflow procedures that we believed successfully minimized the risk of sample contamination with our Listeria assay. However, in late August 2014, we became aware that while some of our customers successfully implemented the revised sample workflow procedures, one of our high-volume customers found it difficult to consistently follow these revised sample workflow procedures and sporadically experienced false positive test results due to inadvertent sample contamination, primarily in connection with environmental testing. These difficulties caused the customer to delay further implementation of the Listeria assay. In late 2014, we commenced an initiative to develop a new Listeria assay, specifically for use in environmental testing, intended to be less susceptible to inadvertent sample contamination. In July 2015, we announced that we received AOAC approval for our new Listeria assay, the Atlas Listeria Environmental Detection Assay. We made this new assay available to customers in the fourth quarter of 2015. We are currently unable to accurately forecast customer adoption of the new assay, as current and potential customers are expected to conduct thorough evaluations of the new assay. The outcome of such customer evaluations is uncertain. Any failure of our Atlas solution to meet customer benchmarks or expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing testing methods or to adopt systems other than ours. Even if our new Listeria assay meets customer expectations, we may experience only modest impact on our sales in the near term. As a result, we do not expect our revenue to increase significantly in the near term until we place additional instruments and successfully commercialize the new Atlas Listeria Environmental Detection Assay as well as our other assays. The failure or perceived failure of our products to perform as expected, has had, and in the future could have, a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nIf we are sued for product liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of product liability claims against us were someone to allege that our products failed to identify, or inaccurately or incompletely identified, information regarding the specific pathogens being testing using our products. For instance, in the event a customer using our products is required to recall its food products, such customer may make a claim against us. We may also be subject to liability for errors in, a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide in the ordinary course of our business activities. A product liability claim could result in substantial damages to us and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nWe maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability claims. Any product or liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation, or cause current customers and potential customers to seek other products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nIf our facility in San Diego, California becomes damaged or inoperable or we are required to vacate this facility, our ability to continue manufacturing our assays will be disrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe manufacture our Atlas Detection Assays and conduct our research and development activities in our facility in San Diego, California. In addition, our San Diego facility is the center for quality assurance and distribution operations and instrument service and customer technical support. Our facility and the equipment we use to manufacture our assays would be costly, and would require substantial lead-time, to repair or replace. San Diego is situated near active earthquake fault lines. The facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, communications failure or terrorism, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to produce our assays or continue our\nresearch and development activities for some period of time. This inability to manufacture our assays for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. We carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with damage or disruption to our business, may not provide coverage in amounts sufficient to cover our potential losses, and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFailure to manufacture our assays in accordance with product specifications could result in increased costs, lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction or voluntary product recalls, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nProperly manufacturing our Atlas Detection Assays requires precise technological execution and strict compliance with our guidelines. We may experience problems in the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, such as equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols or human error. If problems arise during the production of a particular product lot, that product lot may need to be discarded or destroyed. This could among other things, result in increased costs, lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction and injury to our reputation. If problems are not discovered before the product lot is released to the market, we may incur recall and product liability costs. Any failure to manufacture our products in accordance with product specifications could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our assays in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, and at acceptable costs, our ability to sell our products will be harmed.\nOur Atlas Detection Assays must be manufactured in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with our requirements. In determining the required quantities of assays and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. There could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we and our customers require, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nAdditional work will be required for scaling-up manufacturing of each new assay prior to commercialization, and we may not successfully complete this work. Manufacturing and quality control problems may arise in the future as we attempt to scale up our manufacturing of a new assay, and we may not achieve scale-up in a timely manner, at a commercially reasonable cost or at all. New assays that detect or quantify more than one target pathogen may contain significantly more complex reagents, which will increase the cost of our manufacturing processes and quality control testing. We may not be able to manufacture these products at a cost or in quantities that would make these products commercially viable. If we are unable to develop or contract for manufacturing capabilities on acceptable terms for our products under development, we may not be able to expand our product offerings.\nIf we are unable to support demand for our Atlas Detection Assays, Atlas instrument or our future products, including ensuring that we have adequate capacity to meet increased demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nAs our business grows, we will need to continue to increase our workflow capacity for sales, customer service and support, billing and general process improvements, expand our internal quality assurance program and expand our manufacturing capability. We will need additional personnel to support an expansion of our business. We will also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, setup, and validate, and increase our software and computing capacity to meet increased demand. There is no assurance that any of these increases in scale, expansion of personnel, equipment, software and computing capacities, or process enhancements will be successfully implemented. Failure to manage this growth could result in an inability to supply our products as needed, higher product costs, declining product quality, deteriorating customer service, and slower responses to competitive challenges. A failure in any one of these areas could make it difficult for us to meet market expectations for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nOur future success may depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop, introduce and commercialize new products. New product development involves a lengthy and complex process and we may be unable to commercialize new or improved assays or any other products we may develop on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe market for our products is characterized by changing technology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which could make our competitors\u2019 products more attractive and our existing products obsolete. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop new innovative products that meet our customer\u2019s needs and expectations. Our failure to successfully develop new products on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nThe development of new or enhanced assays is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological, market and industry trends, as well as precise technological execution. In addition, the successful development of new products may depend on the development of new technologies. We may be required to undertake time-consuming and costly development activities. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, commercialization and marketing of these new products. Before we can commercialize any new products, we will need to expend significant funds in order to conduct substantial research and development, including validation studies.\nOur product development process involves a high degree of risk, and product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including a failure to demonstrate the performance of the product or an inability to obtain any required certification or regulatory approval, if any.\nAs we develop products, we will have to make significant investments in product development, as well as sales and marketing resources. In addition, competitors may develop and commercialize competing products faster than we are able to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nIf we cannot provide quality technical support, we could lose customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nThe placement of our products at new customer sites, the introduction of the technology used in our products and ongoing customer support can be complex. Accordingly, we need highly trained technical support personnel to support the installation and maintenance of the Atlas instrument and provide technical proficiency training for operators of the Atlas instrument. Attracting and retaining technical support personnel is very competitive in our industry. Customers are particularly sensitive to any interruptions or downtime with respect to our Atlas instruments and therefore we need to retain sufficient technical support staff to service and maintain the Atlas instruments that we place. In addition, extensive training is required to learn and understand our Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument. In order to manage our growth and effectively support potential new customers and the expanding needs of our current customers, we may need to expand our technical support staff. If we are unable to attract, train or retain the number of highly qualified technical services personnel that our business may need or if we are unable to provide our customers with the technical support that they need, we may be unable to retain our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nThe loss of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team, including Mary Duseau, our President and Chief Executive Officer. The individual and collective efforts of our senior management team will be important as we continue to expand our commercial activities and develop additional products. The loss or incapacity of existing members of our senior management team could adversely affect our operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors. Our executive officers have employment agreements; however, the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee the retention of the executive officer for any period of time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees.\nOur research and development programs and laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and technicians. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the competition for such qualified personnel. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. All of our employees are at-will, which means that either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting or retaining qualified sales people. Recruiting and retention difficulties can limit our ability to support our research and development and sales programs. The loss of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, technicians and sales personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of businesses and assets. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage the proprietary molecular technology used in our assays and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. We have no history of acquiring other companies or with forming strategic partnerships. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in the issuance of equity securities, incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill, any of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that we would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance, or joint venture.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the use of hazardous materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant. The use of hazardous materials in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur customers and potential customers expect our products to have third party certifications, such as AOAC, and it may be time-consuming and expensive to achieve and maintain such certifications for our Atlas Detection Assays or any new assays that we develop in the future.\nOur customers expect that our assays will be certified by a third party, such as the AOAC. Any certification process, including the AOAC certification process utilized by us, can be expensive, time-consuming and subject to unexpected delays and we may not achieve such certification. Our current assays are certified by the AOAC; however, if new or expanded validation standards are required by our customers or governmental agencies, we may need to expand the validation of our certified assays to meet such requirements, which we may not be able to achieve. In addition, our competitors may have or achieve certifications for their assays that we have not yet obtained which could give our competitors an advantage and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively expand commercialization of our products to existing and new customers.\nAlthough our products are not currently subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other U.S. government regulatory agencies, they could become subject to U.S. or international government regulation in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nOur products are not currently subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the USDA. However, the FDA, the USDA or comparable agencies in other countries could expand their jurisdiction over our products, which could impose restrictions on our ability to market and sell our products. A significant change in the way that the FDA, the USDA or comparable agencies in other countries regulate our products could require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws or requirements. Such compliance could be time-consuming and expensive and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nOur customers are required to implement food safety testing programs, and regulatory changes in the future that are implemented by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nOur customers are required by regulatory agencies to implement food safety testing programs. In the future, the FDA, the USDA, or comparable agencies in other countries could require customers to use testing methods that are different than ours or require customers to test for different types of pathogens, organisms or chemicals than we offer, both of which could give our competitors an advantage if their products meet those requirements. A significant change in the way that the FDA, the USDA or equivalent agencies in other countries regulates the testing procedures or methods used by our customers could require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws or requirements. Such compliance could be time consuming and expensive and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nIf we expand our operations internationally, our business may be exposed to additional business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nWe currently have no international operations and our revenues from international sales are limited, but we intend to selectively expand our operations internationally. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\u2022\nadditional potentially relevant third-party patent rights;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm any future international expansion and operations and, consequently, could adversely affect our business prospects.\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant elements of our operations, including our enterprise resource planning system, our laboratory information management system, our computational biology system and our customer relationship management system. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including laboratory operations, test validation, sample tracking, quality control, customer service support, billing and reimbursement, research and development activities and financial and general administrative activities. Information technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and similar disruptive problems. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nProlonged negative economic conditions could adversely affect us, our customers and suppliers, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in general economic and market conditions. Uncertainty remains in the U.S. economy as it continues to recover from a severe economic recession. The U.S. economy continues to experience market volatility, difficulties in the financial services sector, diminished liquidity and availability of credit, concerns regarding inflation, increases in the cost of commodities, continuing high unemployment rates, reduced consumer spending and consumer confidence and continuing economic uncertainties. The economic turmoil and uncertainty about future economic conditions could adversely impact our expenses and cause delays or other problems with our customers and key suppliers, including Gen-Probe and Stratec Biomedical AG. In addition there is a risk that one or more of our current customers, suppliers or other third parties with which we conduct business may not survive these difficult economic times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nWe are dependent on Gen-Probe and Gen-Probe\u2019s contract manufacturer as our sole source of supply for the Atlas instrument pursuant to our supply agreement with Gen-Probe. If Gen-Probe terminates our supply agreement or Gen-Probe or its contract manufacturer fails to timely supply the Atlas instrument as needed by us, our business and our product sales will suffer.\nWe rely on Gen-Probe as our sole source of supply for the Atlas instrument. Under the terms of our supply agreement with Gen-Probe, Gen-Probe is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the instruments we order from them consistent with our forecasting obligations. However, Gen-Probe does not manufacture the Atlas instrument, but relies on one third-party manufacturer, Stratec, to produce the Atlas instrument which Gen-Probe receives from Stratec and then delivers to us. Our dependence on Gen-Probe and Gen-Probe\u2019s dependence on Stratec exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability at Stratec, quality control, quality assurance and costs. Gen-\nProbe utilizes its Panther instrument for clinical diagnostic testing. The Panther instrument, which is what we commercialize as the Atlas instrument, is also produced solely by Stratec and, in the event Gen-Probe\u2019s demand for Panther instruments increases, our ability to obtain our Atlas instruments on a timely basis could be adversely impacted if Stratec\u2019s manufacturing capability is insufficient to handle the demand for Panther and Atlas instruments.\nIf either Gen-Probe or Stratec experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to supply us with the Atlas instrument in sufficient quantities, then instrument shipments to us and our customers could be adversely impacted, which could restrict our growth and harm our competitive position and reputation. Further, because Gen-Probe places its orders with Stratec based on forecasts of expected demand for its instruments, including the Atlas instrument, if we or Gen-Probe inaccurately forecast demand, Gen-Probe may be unable to obtain adequate quantities of the Atlas instrument as needed by us and to meet our customer\u2019s delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories. In determining the required quantities of Atlas instruments, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amount of Atlas instruments we and our customers require, which could harm our business and results of operations. An interruption in our sales and operations would occur if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing the Atlas instrument from Gen-Probe. Any such interruption could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Since we rely on Gen-Probe as the sole supplier of the Atlas system, any disruption in Gen-Probe\u2019s operations could impact our supply chain and our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue.\nUnder our supply agreement with Gen-Probe, we have the right to terminate the supply agreement under certain circumstances and obtain an alternate supplier, including Stratec, for the Atlas instrument. However, we may be unable to negotiate an arrangement with Stratec or another manufacturer that is acceptable to us. Transitioning to a new manufacturer would be time consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our operations and could affect the performance specifications of our Atlas instrument.\nWe are dependent on single source suppliers for some of our components and materials used in our products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on single source suppliers, including Gen-Probe, for certain components and materials used in our products, including our assays. Gen-Probe in turn relies on an independent third-party single source supplier for certain of these components and raw materials. Since our contracts with these suppliers, including Gen-Probe, do not commit them to carry inventory or to make available any particular quantities, they may give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours and we may be unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. We periodically forecast our needs for such components and raw materials and enter into standard purchase orders with our suppliers. In determining the required quantities of Atlas supplies, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amount of components and raw materials we and our customers require, which could harm our business and results of operations. However, if we lose such suppliers or our suppliers encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand for our components and raw materials, we may not be able to identify or enter into agreements with alternative suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms, if at all. Transitioning to a new supplier would be time consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our operations and could affect the performance specifications of our assays. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing the quality and quantity of materials we require for our products, our ability to manufacture our products would be interrupted which could adversely affect our sales. In addition, an impurity or variation from specification in our raw materials we receive could significantly delay our ability to manufacture our products. If any of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on FedEx for the storage and distribution of our products and, if FedEx incurs any damage to the facilities where our products are stored or is unable to distribute our products as needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nWe rely on FedEx for the storage and distribution of our products. The facilities where our products are stored by FedEx may also be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, communications failure or terrorism. Any material destruction to the facilities where our products are stored could adversely affect our inventory and the ability of FedEx to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, an inability to maintain our contract with FedEx when it comes up for renewal or a disruption or slowdown in the operations of FedEx, including as a result of damage to the facilities of FedEx or a strike by FedEx, could cause delays in our ability to fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, our products to be returned or receipt of products to be refused, any of which could adversely affect our business and our results of operations. Our contract with FedEx is generally terminable upon 90 days\u2019 prior written notice by either party for convenience without cause. If we are unable to maintain our contract with FedEx,\nwe would be required to retain a new third party logistics company and we may be unable to retain such third party at a cost that is acceptable to us. If our shipping costs were to increase as a result of an increase by FedEx or as a result of obtaining a new third-party logistics company and if we are unable to pass on these higher costs to our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nIntellectual Property Risks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from selling our products.\nWe are dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies, all of which we have licensed or sublicensed from Gen-Probe. We do not own the patents that underlie these licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of and compliance with the terms of those licenses. In some cases, such as the patents we license from Gen-Probe, we do not control the prosecution, maintenance, or filing of the patents to which we hold licenses, or the enforcement of these patents against third parties. Some of our patents and patent applications were either acquired from another company who acquired those patents and patent applications from yet another company, or are licensed from a third party. Thus, these patents and patent applications are not written by us or our attorneys, and we did not have control over the drafting and prosecution. The former patent owners and our licensors might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of these patents and applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the patents and applications and had control over the drafting and prosecution. We cannot be certain that drafting and/or prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications by the licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOur rights to use the technology we license are subject to the validity of the owner\u2019s intellectual property rights. Enforcement of our licensed patents or defense or any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents is often subject to the control or cooperation of our licensors. Legal action could be initiated against the owners of the intellectual property that we license and an adverse outcome in such legal action could harm our business because it might prevent such companies or institutions from continuing to license intellectual property that we may need to operate our business. In addition, such licensors may resolve such litigation in a way that benefits them but adversely affects our ability to use the licensed technology for our products.\nCertain of our licenses contained in our agreement with Gen-Probe contain provisions that allow the licensor to terminate the license if (i) we breach any payment obligation or other material provision under the agreement and fail to cure the breach within a fixed time following written notice of termination, (ii) we or any of our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees directly or indirectly challenge the validity, enforceability, or extension of any of the licensed patents or (iii) we declare bankruptcy or dissolve. Our rights under the licenses are subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the license, including the payment of royalties due under the license. Termination of these licenses could prevent us from marketing some or all of our products. Because of the complexity of our products and the patents we have licensed, determining the scope of the license and related royalty obligations can be difficult and can lead to disputes between us and the licensor. An unfavorable resolution of such a dispute could lead to an increase in the royalties payable pursuant to the license. If a licensor believed we were not paying the royalties due under the license or were otherwise not in compliance with the terms of the license, the licensor might attempt to revoke the license. If such an attempt were successful, we might be barred from producing and selling some or all of our products.\nThe prosecution and enforcement of patents licensed to us by third parties are not within our control. Without these technologies, our products may not be successful and our business would be harmed if the patents were infringed or misappropriated without action by such third parties.\nIn some cases, such as pursuant to the Gen-Probe agreement, we do not have the right to control the prosecution, issuance, filing and maintenance of the patents and patent applications we have licensed and are reliant on our licensors. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and patent applications will be controlled in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. This may result in the rights we have licensed being reduced or eliminated and may adversely affect the coverage, scope and jurisdictional reach of the patent rights encompassing our commercial offerings. In some cases, such as pursuant to the Gen-Probe agreement, we also do not have the right to bring and control a patent infringement action against third parties, based on the patents to which we hold licenses. In these situations, we are reliant on our licensors to bring and control such action and our licensors are under no obligation to do so, even in fields for which we have an exclusive license. This may adversely affect our ability to compete successfully with our competitors. While certain of the licenses under which we have rights provide us with exclusive rights in specified fields, the scope of our rights under these and other licenses may be subject to dispute. In addition, our rights to practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not terminating them. Our\nlicenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in breach of certain terms or conditions of the license agreement or in certain other circumstances.\nClaims that our molecular assays and instruments infringe the patent rights of third parties could result in costly litigation or, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse impact on our ability to commercialize our current or future products, grow and maintain profitability and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our products, or the use of our products, do not infringe third-party patents. Third parties might allege that we are infringing their patent rights or that we have misappropriated their trade secrets. Such third parties might resort to litigation against us. The basis of such litigation could be existing patents or patents that issue in the future.\nWe may not be aware of all relevant third-party patents or patent applications. Furthermore, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing, which is referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or their use could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Third parties may have obtained, and may in the future obtain, patents under which such third parties may claim that the use of our products constitutes patent infringement. Furthermore, as we continue to commercialize our molecular assays and instruments in their current or future form, launch new products, and enter new markets, we expect that competitors may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets. We may receive letters from third parties inviting us to take licenses under, or alleging our infringement of their patents.\nFor example, we are aware of a U.S. patent owned by Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., or Enzo, which filed lawsuits in 2012 against Gen-Probe alleging that certain of Gen-Probe\u2019s molecular diagnostic products infringe Enzo\u2019s patent. Action was also filed against several other companies. Enzo sought permanent injunctive relief and unspecified damages. Enzo\u2019s patent contains claims to oligonucleotides containing certain modified nucleotides. We use oligonucleotides containing modified nucleotides in our hybridization protection and dual kinetic assays. If we are eventually named as a party to the litigation between Enzo and Gen-Probe, if Enzo files a separate lawsuit against us, or if any other third party sues us alleging patent infringement, we may be unable to successfully defend such action and an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, Gen-Probe may resolve such litigation in a way that benefits them but adversely affects our ability to use the licensed technology for our products. We are also aware of a third-party U.S. patent that expired in 2015, which has some claims that are relevant to nucleic acid hybridization and detection. As a result, we could be subject to litigation for patent infringement, and could be liable for damages for sales occurring prior to the expiration of the patent if we did not prevail in such litigation, and an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf a third-party patent is successfully asserted against us, we could be barred from commercializing our current products and may owe a substantial damages award, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and business and financial condition. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and stock price. If we were to challenge the validity of any issued U.S. patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every U.S. patent. This means that in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from commercializing our current products. We may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. We could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins. Moreover, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to commercialize our current or future products, grow and maintain profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDevelopments in patent law could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, changes to the way issued patents are challenged, and changes to the way patent applications are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act may affect our ability to obtain patents, and if obtained, to enforce or defend them. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend any patents that may issue from our patent applications, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property effectively, which could harm our competitive position.\nObtaining and maintaining a strong patent position is important to our business. Our patent applications are in the early stages of prosecution and none have yet issued as patents. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is complex and uncertain, so we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain or maintain patent rights, or that the patent rights we may obtain will be valuable, provide an effective barrier to competitors or otherwise provide competitive advantages. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors. To determine the priority of inventions, or demonstrate that we did not derive our invention from another, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO or in court that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection. We cannot be assured our patent applications will prevail over those filed by others. Also, our intellectual property rights may be subject to other challenges by third parties. Patents we obtain could be challenged in litigation or in administrative proceedings such as ex parte reexam, inter partes review, or post grant review in the United States or opposition proceedings in Europe or other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nLegal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or interferences against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third-parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. For example, significant elements of the Atlas system are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and legal recourse to which we are entitled against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biotechnology. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for the technology used in our products and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. We have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. These agreements provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights with collaborators with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our collaborators that arise from the results of the collaboration. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the resolution of intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party collaborator\u2019s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator\u2019s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the market potential of these inventions. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other diagnostic, life sciences or food companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, commercialize our products and expand our operations.\nBased on our current business plan, we currently anticipate that we will have sufficient capital to fund our existing operations through the end of 2017. We need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, to repay our outstanding indebtedness, and to make two payments of $5.0 million due to Gen-Probe in each of 2018 and 2020. Our liquidity requirements may be negatively impacted by changes in our business plan, a lengthier sales cycle, lower demand for our products or other risks described elsewhere in this annual report and therefore we may need to raise capital sooner than currently anticipated. We expect to raise additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations or licensing\narrangements. We may also consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities, or for other reasons\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour revenue growth rate and ability to generate cash flows from operating activities;\n\u2022\nour sales and marketing and research and development activities;\n\u2022\neffects of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\ncosts of and potential delays in product development;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory oversight applicable to our products; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to international expansion.\nThe various ways we could raise additional capital carry potential risks. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also could provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, those debt securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our platform technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse, or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the U.S. federal government. These events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain. Accordingly, additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, our current loan and security agreements restrict our ability to raise funds through additional debt or certain other financing options. If we cannot secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more research and development programs or sales and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nWe are an early, commercial-stage company and have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.\nWe are an early, commercial-stage company and have a limited operating history. We were incorporated in Delaware and began operations in 2009 following the acquisition of the industrial market assets of Gen-Probe. Our limited operating history, lengthy sales cycle and limited number of customers may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. Any assessment of our profitability or prediction about our future success or viability is subject to significant uncertainty. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early, commercial-stage companies in rapidly evolving industries. If we do not address these risks successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and business.\nWe have a history of net losses. We expect to incur net losses in the future and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have historically incurred substantial net losses, including net losses of $30.8 million, $36.6 million and $32.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $208.1 million. Although we have started generating limited revenue, we expect our losses to continue as a result of increased commercialization costs, increased cost of revenue, including manufacturing costs, and research and development expenses. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets, and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to achieve and then sustain profitability would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nOur independent auditors report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding management's conclusion that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDue to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on our audited annual financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding management's conclusion that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. Under our loan agreement, our loan may become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of a material adverse change. Additionally, we are subject to customary operational covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem stock, make specified investments and engage in merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph regarding management's conclusion that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our lack of cash resources may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into critical contractual relations with third parties.\nOur loan contains covenants that may limit our flexibility in operating our business and failure to comply with any of these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn May 2015, we entered into an amended loan and security agreement with Comerica, which is secured by a lien on our assets, excluding certain intellectual property. The loan contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell, transfer, lease or dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\nengage in certain mergers and consolidations;\n\u2022\nincur debt or encumber or permit liens on certain assets, except in the limited circumstances permitted under the loan and security agreements;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments, including paying dividends on, or repurchasing or making distributions with respect to, our common stock; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates.\nA breach of any of the covenants under the loan and security agreement could result in a default under the loan. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the loan, Comerica could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, our loan may become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of a material adverse change. If we are unable to repay those amounts, Comerica could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to annual limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, or other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or reduce taxes. Our past issuances of stock and other changes in our stock ownership may have resulted in ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code; accordingly, our pre-change NOLs may be subject to limitation under Section 382. If we determine that we have not undergone an ownership change, the Internal Revenue Service could challenge our analysis, and our ability to use our NOLs to offset taxable income could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, including changes which are outside of our control, could result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code further limiting our ability to utilize our NOLs. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to use a material portion of the NOLs, even if we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and our stockholders could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. From January 2015 through December 2016, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from a high of $47.30 per share in the first quarter of 2015, to a low of $3.66 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and NASDAQ and emerging growth companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nWe and certain of our officers and directors have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to securities class action lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe, and certain of our officers and directors, were named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit that generally alleges that we and certain of our officers and directors violated the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) by making allegedly false and misleading statements pertaining to placements of our Atlas instruments and our expectations of future growth and increased market share and by failing to disclose \u201cknown trends and uncertainties about the Company\u2019s sales.\u201d The court appointed Stanley Yedlowski as lead plaintiff and The Rosen Law Firm as lead counsel on April 21, 2015. Defendants filed a motion on August 25, 2015 to dismiss, and plaintiffs filed an opposition to that motion on October 9, 2015. The parties entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by the court in December 2016, to pay approximately $3.3 million. As a result,\nwe have recorded a liability on our Balance Sheet. Additionally, we have recorded a corresponding receivable on our Balance Sheet for the expected reimbursement under our insurance policies.\nFurthermore, in the future, we may be subject to securities class action litigation, which if concluded in a manner adverse to us would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Even if we were to be successful in the defense of any such litigation, we could incur substantial costs, significant legal expenses, suffer a significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management's attention and resources from other priorities, including the execution of business plans and strategies that are important to our ability to grow our business, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations.\nWe are in the early stage of commercializing our Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument, and may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the future. The rate of market acceptance of our Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas instrument could contribute to this quarterly variability. Our longer and unpredictable sales cycle for the adoption of our Atlas solution complicates our ability to project quarterly revenue. For example, in 2016, we placed twelve instruments, whereas in 2015, we placed three Atlas instruments primarily because customers decided to continue to evaluate our Atlas solution further and were waiting for the launch of our new Listeria assay before deciding to change their testing methods and adopt our Atlas solution. In addition, the revenue generated from sales of our Atlas Detection Assays may fluctuate from time to time due to changes in the testing volumes of our customers. Furthermore, our expense levels are based, in part, on expectation of future revenue levels, and a shortfall in expected revenue could, therefore, result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income. As a result, our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders exercise substantial influence over our company.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders who are affiliated with certain of our board members and beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock in the aggregate, beneficially owned shares representing approximately 37.2% of our outstanding capital stock as of February 28, 2017. These stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over our management and affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere may not be an active trading market for our common stock.\nWe completed our initial public offering in July 2014. Although our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, there has been limited trading activity. The lack of an active market for our common stock may impair investors\u2019 ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the fair market value of their shares and may impair our ability to raise additional capital.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nOur stock price could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nHolders of approximately 0.8 million common shares, or approximately 17%, of our outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2016, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans.\nIn addition, in the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are electing not to take advantage of such extended transition period, and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to not take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2019, the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.\nWe are incurring significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and rules of the SEC and those of The NASDAQ Stock Market, or the NASDAQ, have imposed various requirements on public companies including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Our management and other personnel have and will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, requires us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Furthermore, if in the future we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart of Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, or a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined under applicable SEC rules, we will be required to have our independent registered accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, as applicable, in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section 404, as applicable, requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and may need to implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our indebtedness with Comerica prohibit us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for anyone that invests in our common stock for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, anyone that invests in our common stock will likely only experience a gain from their investment in our common stock if the price of our common stock increases.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nclassifying our board of directors into three classes;\n\u2022\nauthorizing \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nproviding our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.", "PERMNO": 14827, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ROKA"}
