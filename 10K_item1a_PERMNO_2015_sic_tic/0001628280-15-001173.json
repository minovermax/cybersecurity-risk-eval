{"cik": "1277141", "company": "Borderfree, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have incurred operating losses in recent fiscal periods and may be unable to sustain profitability, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWe incurred operating losses in certain recent fiscal periods. We reported net loss of $3.1 million and $0.7 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively, however, we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $19.5 million. We expect to continue to make future expenditures to develop and expand our business that may result in us incurring future losses. In addition, as a public company we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. These increased expenditures will make it harder for us to sustain future profitability. Our recent growth in revenue and number of customers may not be sustainable, and we may not achieve sufficient revenue to maintain profitability if our growth slows or we lose customers or have customers reduce their sales volume on our platform. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in these Risk Factors, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. For example, one of our strategies is to substantially increase the number of carriers and logistics hubs. If we fail to manage growth and additional complexity in our logistics network, our ability to reduce our fulfillment costs and increase sales conversion could be adversely affected. Additionally, we may experience fluctuations in foreign currencies which could reduce cross-border trade which in turn could adversely affect the sales volume on our platform. Accordingly, we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nOur limited history as a comprehensive global ecommerce platform makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.\nIn 2008, we changed our business and began offering a comprehensive solution that allows U.S. retailers to transact with consumers worldwide. We have a limited operating history with respect to our current business, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. For example, the results for the set of customers that we launch each year inherently reflect a distinct group of retailers and consumers and may not be representative of our current or future composite group of retailers and consumers, particularly as we grow and our customer base broadens. In addition, the results for each such customer cohort may reflect unique market and consumer dynamics during the periods covered and may not be indicative of the future performance of such cohort or other cohorts. In recent periods we have experienced significant growth, and have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including increasing and unforeseen expenses as we continue to grow our business. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business may be adversely impacted.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. The loss of a key customer or the significant reduction of business from our largest customers could significantly reduce our revenue.\nWe have derived, and we believe that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, many of whom can terminate their agreements with us upon 30 to 90 days prior written notice. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2014 transactions with our largest ten customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 67% our global ecommerce revenue. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Additionally, transactions with our top three customers generated approximately 26% of our global ecommerce revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 27% for the year ended December 31, 2013 and approximately 31% for the year ended December 31, 2012.\nBecause the primary driver of global ecommerce services and fulfillment services revenue are the international cross-border sales processed through our platform, our total revenue is dependent on a relatively small number of customers and their end consumers who will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to provide our ecommerce solutions to this small number of customers. Any revenue growth will depend on our success in retaining our customers, growing our customers\u2019 sales processed on our platform and acquiring additional customers. The loss of one or more of our customers, particularly the loss of any of our larger customers, whether through change in customer strategy, acquisitions, consolidations, bankruptcies, terminations for convenience or otherwise, or the failure to retain a significant amount of business from our customers, could harm our business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers, or the sales volumes generated by them on our platform decline, or does not increase, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur customer contracts typically have initial multi-year terms ranging from one to four years, followed by one-year renewal periods. We generate a significant portion of revenue from fees paid to us by our customers based on a percentage of their total gross international sales revenue processed through our platform. We also generate revenue from consumers for fulfillment services, including revenue related to international shipping, handling, and other efforts associated with delivering global logistics services, and foreign exchange and other transaction related fees. These contributors to our revenue are driven by international ecommerce sales generated on our platform.\nOur customers often have the right to terminate their agreements for convenience by providing 30 to 90 days prior written notice, and have no obligation to renew their agreements with us after their terms expire. Even if these agreements are renewed, they may not be renewed on the same or on more profitable terms. We expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from our existing customers\u2019 total sales on our platform and we expect our future revenue growth to be driven by increases in our existing customers\u2019 sales. Despite such expectations, we cannot guarantee that our customers process a minimum volume of sales using our ecommerce solutions. As a result, if existing customers terminate their agreements with us, elect to operate their cross-border trading in certain markets by setting up local operations, do not renew their agreements with us, renew on less favorable terms, do not generate their current volume of sales using our solutions, or demand a fixed pricing per transaction model, our operating results and financial condition will suffer. In addition, the rate at which our customers increase their sales volumes on our platform, and the rate at which new customers adopt our ecommerce solutions is critical to our future growth. Factors that may affect sales volumes processed on our platform, and the adoption rate for our solution include:\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and functionality of our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe availability, price performance and functionality of competing solutions;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our logistics and customer support services;\n\u2022\nthe degree and the rate to which our customers adopt our marketing programs and solutions to drive additional traffic to their ecommerce sites; and\n\u2022\nthe strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, which may affect international end consumers' ability or willingness to purchase our customers' products\nIf our efforts to attract new customers are not successful, our revenue growth will be adversely affected, and the new customers we do attract may not generate revenue comparable to our current or historical customers.\nOne of our growth strategies is to acquire new customers. There is no guarantee that we can sustain our historical acquisition rates. Our ability to attract new customers will depend in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts, which may not be successful. Our prospective customers may not be familiar with our solution, or may have traditionally used other products and services for their international ecommerce needs. Our prospective customers may develop their own solutions to address their international ecommerce needs, purchase competitive product offerings, or engage third-party providers of services that do not use our solution to provide their services. In addition, attracting new customers requires substantial time and expense. It may be difficult to identify, engage and market to customers who do not currently have ecommerce needs or are unfamiliar with our solution, and many of our customers typically require input from one or more internal levels of approval. This requires us to spend substantial time and effort assisting potential customers in evaluating our solution including providing demonstrations. If our prospective customers do not perceive our solution to be of sufficiently high value and quality, we may not be able to attract new customers and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. Additionally, even if we are successful in attracting new customers, such new customers may not generate comparable revenue relative to our current or historical customers, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and our growth.\nFluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies, which may reduce cross-border trade, could harm our business.\nInternational sales generated by our customers processing transactions through our platform are the primary source of both revenue and profit for us. The operating results of, and sales generated from, many of our customers\u2019 internationally focused websites running on our platform are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For example, for a U.S. retailer running on our platform, if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of the prices of the retailer\u2019s products into foreign currency denominated transactions would decrease, which may result in increased international sales volumes, revenue and net income for us. Conversely, to the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, as experienced in 2014 with the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, euro and Russian Ruble, and in 2013 with the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen, cross-border trade related to purchases of dollar-denominated goods from our U.S.-based retailers running on our platform by non-U.S. purchasers will likely decrease, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. As exchange rates in foreign currencies vary, our net revenue and other operating results may differ materially from expectations. For example, during the second half of 2014, our sales volumes were negatively impacted by the U.S. dollar which strengthened against most major currencies, including the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, our two largest individual markets in terms of international sales volumes. In addition, if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against major currencies (for example, the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, euro and pound sterling), due to worsening economic conditions, divergence in monetary policies or for any other reasons, our revenue and operating results would be adversely impacted.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is seasonal in nature and the fourth quarter is a significant period for our operating results due to the holiday season. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, fourth quarter revenue represented approximately 29%, 32% and 36% of our total annual revenue, respectively. As a result, revenue and income (loss) from operations generally decline (increase) in the first quarter sequentially from the fourth quarter of the previous year.\nAny disruption in our ability to process and fulfill consumer orders in the fourth quarter could have a negative effect on our quarterly and annual operating results. For example, if a large number of end consumers access our customers\u2019 websites that operate on our platform in a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may experience system interruptions that prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell through, and the attractiveness of, our platform. In addition, we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. Additionally, any disruption in our business operations or the operations of our customers or logistics providers or other factors that could lead to a material shortfall compared with our expectations for the fourth quarter could result in a significant shortfall in revenue and operating cash flows for the full year.\nIf we do not successfully optimize and operate our logistics network, our business and growth strategy could be harmed.\nThe cost of shipping is one of the largest obstacles to a global consumer completing an online purchase. An important part of our strategy is to improve order submit rates through our efficiencies and cost reductions via improvements and expansion of our logistics and distribution infrastructure and our supply chain. As part of this strategy, we intend to continue reducing the cost of logistics by expanding the number of hubs and carriers in our logistics network. As we continue to expand the number of hubs and carriers, our logistics network will become increasingly complex and operating it may become more challenging. If one or more service providers in our logistics network on whom we rely fail to perform adequately, our ability to optimize and operate our logistics network will be impaired. If we are unsuccessful in continuing to optimize and operate, our logistics network, our fulfillment costs, operating results, financial condition and growth prospects will be adversely affected.\nIf we experience delays in the customer implementation process, it could delay our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nIn the initial stage of implementation our ecommerce solution is configured and integrated based on the customer\u2019s needs. It may be difficult for us to manage the timeliness of these implementations and the allocation of personnel and resources by us or our customers. If our infrastructure capacity is insufficient to meet our needs, we may experience delays in deploying our solution to new customers, or expanding the solutions we offer to existing customers. We do not recognize significant revenue from customers until their ecommerce solution is launched. If the launch of our solution with a new customer is delayed or an expansion of our solution with an existing customer is delayed due to complications in the implementation process caused by us or our customers, our recognition of revenue for the deployment or expansion with such customer will be delayed. Therefore, failure to successfully manage customer implementations could result in a delay in our ability to recognize revenue. In the past, delays in customer implementation have also resulted in unexpected variances in our results. Delays in implementation could also increase costs, harm our reputation, cause us to lose existing customers, lead to potential customer disputes or limit the adoption rate of our solutions, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our future revenue and causes variability in our operating results.\nOur sales cycle can vary substantially from customer to customer, but typically requires four to six months and, in some cases, even longer depending on the size and complexity of the opportunity. A number of factors influence the length and variability of our sales cycles, including, for example:\n\u2022\nthe need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe discretionary nature of potential customers' purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n\u2022\nthe competitive nature of potential customers' evaluation and purchasing processes;\n\u2022\nevolving ecommerce needs and functionality demands of potential customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nlengthy purchasing approval processes of potential customers, who frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision-makers before making purchasing decisions\nOur ability to accurately forecast revenue is affected by our ability to forecast new customer acquisition. Lengthy sales cycles make it difficult to predict the quarter in which revenue from a new customer may first be recognized. If we overestimate new customer growth, our revenue will not grow as we forecast, our costs and expenses may continue to exceed our revenue and our profitability will be harmed. In addition, we plan our operating expenses, including sales and marketing expenses, and our hiring needs in part on our forecasts of new customer growth and future revenue. If new customer growth or revenue for a particular period is lower than expected, we may not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that period, which would harm our operating results for that period and our stock price may decline. Delays in our sales cycles could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, including internally-developed solutions.\nWe face intense competition in the market for ecommerce applications and services, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Increased competition may result in reduced pricing for our solutions, longer sales cycles or a decrease of our market share, any of which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. A number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell our solutions at lower prices or at reduced margins, including, among others:\n\u2022\nexisting and potential customers may choose to develop ecommerce applications in-house, rather than pay for our solutions. For example, when they reach sufficient scale and presence in a market to develop an in-country ecommerce solution and house local inventory to make cross-border transactions unnecessary;\n\u2022\nwe may lose customers that merge with or are acquired by companies using a competitor\u2019s or an internally-developed solution;\n\u2022\nsome of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing and technical resources than we do, allowing them to leverage a larger installed customer base and distribution network, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive sales terms, adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements, and devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can;\n\u2022\ncurrent and potential competitors may merge, have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and expand their markets, and consolidation in our industry is likely to intensify. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share;\n\u2022\ncurrent and potential competitors may offer software that addresses one, or a limited number, of ecommerce functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solutions; and\n\u2022\nsoftware vendors could bundle ecommerce solutions or offer such products at a lower price as part of a larger product sale.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. In addition, competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances or raise additional capital and established companies in other market segments or geographic markets expand into our market segments or geographic markets. If we cannot compete successfully against our competitors, our business, operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire new functionality or enhance our existing solution to meet the needs of our existing and future customers or if we fail to estimate the impact of developing and introducing new functionality and enhanced solutions on our business in response to rapid technological changes, our revenue will decline and our expenditures could increase significantly.\nThe ecommerce market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance, we must continue to enhance and improve our existing solution and we must also continue to introduce new solutions. Any new solutions we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new solutions or enhance our existing solutions or if we fail to price our solutions to meet market demand, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. For example, we intend to expand our sales and marketing investments to focus on acquiring mid-size to smaller U.S. retailers by offering self-service options requiring limited integration time, effort and investment. Our efforts to expand our solution to new organization sizes or beyond existing solutions may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, which could in turn harm our existing business.\nWe expect to incur significant expense to develop additional solutions and functionalities and to integrate acquired solutions or functionalities into our existing platform to maintain our competitive position. These efforts may not result in commercially viable solutions. We may experience difficulties with software development, industry standards, design, manufacturing or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or implementation of new solutions and enhancements. If we do not receive significant revenue from these investments, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, we intend to maintain a single version of each release of our software applications that is configurable to meet the needs of our customers. Customers may require customized solutions, or features and functions that we do not yet offer and do not intend to offer in future releases, which may cause them to choose a competing solution. If we fail to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to renew our contracts with existing customers and our ability to create or increase demand for our solutions will be harmed, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business and operations have experienced rapid growth and organizational change in recent periods, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and infrastructure. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.\nOur growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We increased our number of full-time employees from 81 as of December 31, 2010 to 231 as of December 31, 2014. We intend to further expand our overall business, customer base, headcount and operations, both domestically and internationally, with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow. Our plan to expand our business will substantially increase the complexity of our efforts to optimize and operate our logistics network, and if we fail to do so, our business and growth strategy will be adversely affected. Creating a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will continue to require substantial management effort, the allocation of valuable management resources and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross margins or operating expenses in any particular quarter, and our operating results. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nOur business is sensitive to consumer spending and general economic conditions in the global economy and in the regional markets in which our customers have significant sales.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items may be adversely affected by economic conditions such as employment levels, wage and salary levels, trends in consumer confidence and spending, reductions in consumer net worth, interest rates, inflation, the availability of consumer credit and taxation policies. Consumer purchases in general may decline during recessions, periods of prolonged declines in the equity markets or housing markets and periods when disposable income and perceptions of consumer wealth are lower, and these risks may be exacerbated for us due to our focus on facilitating the sale of discretionary items. In addition, international end consumers of our customers\u2019 products are concentrated in a limited number of regional markets. Sales originating from our top five international markets, Canada, Australia, the U.K., Russia and Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 61% of our sales volume in 2014. A downturn in the global economy, or in a regional market in which our customers have significant sales, could have a material, adverse effect on consumer purchases, our operating results and our financial position, and a downturn adversely affecting our consumer base could have a disproportionate impact on our business. In addition, fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates of the currencies of one or more of our top five international markets against the U.S. dollar could adversely impact end consumer purchases in those markets and affect our business. See \u201c-Fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies, which may reduce cross-border trade, could harm our business\u201d for further information. There continues to be significant volatility and uncertainty in the global economy. In particular, the current uncertainty in Europe (including concerns that certain European countries may default in payments due on their national debt) and Russia (including concerns over the lack of economic growth spurred by falling oil prices, increased geopolitical risks, and imposed sanctions) and any resulting disruption could adversely impact our net sales revenue derived from these regions and elsewhere unless and until economic conditions improve. Further or future economic downturns may adversely affect traffic at merchant websites and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon consumers\u2019 willingness to use the internet for commerce.\nOur solution is focused on enabling international, cross-border ecommerce, and the ecommerce market is less developed in many jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our success depends upon consumers\u2019 continued willingness to use the Internet as a means to purchase goods, communicate, and conduct and research commercial transactions, particularly in markets outside of the United States, where adoption of the Internet and electronic commerce may evolve slowly or may not evolve at all. If consumers became unwilling, less willing or unable to use the Internet for commerce for any reason, including lack of access to high-speed communications equipment, congestion of traffic on the Internet, Internet outages or delays, disruptions or other damage to users\u2019 computers, governmental restrictions, increases in the cost of accessing the Internet and security and privacy risks or the perception of such risks, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, because our services depend to a significant extent on usage of the Internet by consumers, restrictions on such use by certain countries, such as China and those in the Middle East, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEven if demand for ecommerce products and services increases generally, there is no guarantee that demand for a solution like ours will increase to a corresponding degree.\nFor our customers and potential customers to be willing to invest in our ecommerce solutions, the Internet must continue to be accepted and widely used for commerce and communication. If ecommerce does not grow or grows more slowly than expected, then our future revenue and profits may not meet our expectations or those of analysts. The widespread adoption of our solutions depends not only on strong demand for ecommerce products and services generally, but also for products and services delivered via a platform and services business model in particular. Many companies continue to rely primarily or exclusively on traditional means of commerce that are not Internet-based and may be reluctant to change their patterns of commerce. Even if such companies do adopt ecommerce solutions, it is unclear whether they will desire ecommerce solutions like ours. As a result, we cannot assure you that our ecommerce solutions will achieve and sustain the high level of market acceptance that is critical for the future success of our business.\nAny significant disruption in our hosting network infrastructure delivered by a limited number of data centers could harm our reputation, require us to provide credits or refunds, result in early termination of customer agreements or loss of customers, and negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur hosting network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations. End consumers of our customers depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution through the Internet. Our software is proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our solution. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure. Factors that may cause such disruptions include:\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches;\n\u2022\ntelecommunications outages from third-party bandwidth, Internet service, mobile network, electricity and other providers;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism, sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism;\n\u2022\nunforeseen interruption or damages experienced in moving hardware to a new location;\n\u2022\nfire, earthquake, flood and other natural disasters; and\n\u2022\npower loss.\nInterruptions in our services could reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, damage our brand and our reputation and cause customers to terminate their agreements or harm our renewal rates.\nWe manage our services and serve all of our customers from multiple third-party data center facilities. While we engineer and architect the actual computer and storage systems upon which our platform runs and deploy them to the data center facilities, we do not control the operation of these facilities. Our data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. At least one of our data facilities is located in an area known for seismic activity, increasing our susceptibility to the risk that an earthquake could significantly harm the operations of these facilities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, or vandalism or other misconduct, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. In addition, the owners of our data facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions and data that our hosting infrastructure supports. We work with our third-party hosting providers to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our hosting network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers. We also work with our third-party hosting providers to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments. However, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, particularly in the fourth quarter when we might experience significant increases in traffic on our customers\u2019 ecommerce sites, our platform could experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties and financial liabilities and result in customer losses. If our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with increased sales, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain our reputation and brand cost-effectively, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining our reputation and brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions and is an important element in attracting new customers. Our reputation and brand may be impaired by a number of factors, including product malfunctions, data security breaches, network outages and other events as described elsewhere in these risk factors. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful maintenance of our reputation and brand will depend largely on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices to our customers. To date, we have engaged in relatively little direct brand promotion activities, which may enhance the risk that we may not successfully implement brand enhancement efforts in the future. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties, such as global marketing partners.\nWe have formed strategic partnerships with global marketing partners, including payment processors, to expand the reach of our customers to end consumers through the variety of marketing channels offered by these partners. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining our relationships with these third parties or establishing relationships with others in the future, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results would suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in improved operating results.\nWe rely on third-party services, such as shipping and transportation, and payment and foreign exchange providers, in our ecommerce solutions.\nWe rely on third parties, such as shipping and transportation providers, to deliver our customers\u2019 products to end consumers. Shortages of transportation vessels, transportation disruptions or other adverse conditions in the transportation industry due to shortages of truck drivers, strikes, slowdowns, piracy, terrorism, disruptions in rail service, closures of shipping routes, unavailability of ports and port service for other reasons, increases in fuel prices and adverse weather conditions could increase our costs and disrupt our operations and our ability to deliver our customers\u2019 products to end consumers. The failure of our third-party transportation providers to provide high quality customer service when delivering our customers\u2019 product to end consumers would adversely affect our customers\u2019 and our reputation and our relationship with our customers and could negatively impact our business and operating results. In addition, we rely on our third-party service providers to execute our growth strategy of reducing the cost of logistics by expanding the number of hubs and carriers in our logistics network. If we fail to successfully integrate our third-party service providers into these efforts, our growth will be adversely affected. Furthermore, we rely on third parties to provide payment, remittance and worldwide currency exchange services, and we cannot guarantee that such providers will perform adequately. Errors made by, or delays in service from, such third party payment and currency exchange providers could adversely affect our ability to process purchases by consumers on our platform or convert local currencies to U.S. dollars in a timely manner or at all, which could affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur success will depend on our ability to build and maintain relationships with these and other third party service providers on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable to build and maintain such relationships on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to suspend or cease operations. Even if we are able to build and maintain such relationships, if these third parties are unable to deliver their services on a timely basis, end consumers could become dissatisfied and decline to make future purchases from our customers, which would adversely affect our revenue derived from our customers\u2019 ecommerce sites operating on our platform. If our customers become dissatisfied with the services provided by these third parties, our reputation and our company could suffer.\nOur use of and reliance on research and development resources in Israel may expose us to unanticipated costs or events.\nOur principal research and development operations are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its neighboring countries. Acts of terrorism periodically occur which could affect our operations or personnel. Ongoing or revived hostilities or other factors related to Israel could harm our operations and research and development process and could impede our ability to execute our plan of operations, and wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment. Most recently, in July 2014, an armed conflict, which included rocket strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, occurred between Israel and Hamas. Furthermore, certain of our officers and employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up for active military duty at any time. Israeli citizens who have served in the army may be subject to an obligation to perform reserve duty until they are between 40 and 49 years old, depending upon the nature of their military service.\nThere can be no assurance that our reliance upon research and development resources in Israel will enable us to achieve meaningful cost reductions or greater resource efficiency. Further, our research and development efforts and other operations in Israel involve other significant risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty hiring and retaining appropriate engineering personnel because of intense competition for engineers and resulting wage inflation;\n\u2022\ndifficulties regarding the transfer of knowledge related to our technology and resulting exposure to misappropriation of intellectual property or information that is proprietary to us, our customers and other third parties;\n\u2022\nheightened exposure to change in the economic, security and political conditions in Israel; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and difficulties of regulatory compliance in Israel.\nDifficulties resulting from the factors above and other risks related to our operations in Israel could expose us to increased expense, impair our development efforts and harm our competitive position.\nIf our platform contains serious errors or defects, then we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle product liability claims.\nComplex software applications such as our platform often contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Despite internal testing and testing by our customers, our current and future products may contain serious defects, which could result in lost revenue, financial penalties or a delay in market acceptance.\nSince our customers use our platform for critical business applications, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our customers. They could seek significant compensation from us for the losses they suffer. Although our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitations. Even if not successful, a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time-consuming and costly and could seriously damage our reputation in the marketplace, making it harder for us to sell our solutions.\nGovernment and industry regulation of the internet is evolving and could directly restrict our business or indirectly affect our business by limiting the growth of ecommerce. Unfavorable changes in government regulation or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nAs ecommerce continues to evolve, federal and state lawmakers in the US and around the world have adopted and could in the future adopt laws and/or regulations or revise existing regulations covering issues such as user privacy, data security, content, and taxation of products and services. Government regulations could limit the market for our products and services or impose burdensome requirements that render significant costs on our business or even make our business unprofitable. Our ecommerce solutions enable our customers to collect, manage and store a wide range of consumer data, including, without limitation, personal information. The United States and various state governments have adopted or proposed laws that regulate in various ways the collection, distribution, storage, security and/or use of personal information. Many foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, member states of the European Union, Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and many other countries have adopted legislation that regulate the collection, distribution, storage, security and/or use, of personal information and other data. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities, or our customers may terminate their relationships with us.\nIn addition, although many regulations might not apply to our business directly, we expect that laws regulating the solicitation, collection or processing of personal and consumer information could affect our customers\u2019 ability to use and share certain data with us, potentially reducing demand for our services. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers\u2019 ability to use and share consumer data or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet (including potentially in jurisdictions in which we do not have a physical presence) or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. In the United States for example, the U.S. Senate recently passed the Marketplace Fairness Act, which, if approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, would require all online retailers to collect sales taxes for the states where they ship goods. Any regulation imposing taxes, fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could increase our costs or result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could cause the price of our common stock to decline rapidly and significantly, may lead research analysts to change their long-term models for valuing our common stock, could cause short-term liquidity issues, may impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel or cause other unanticipated issues. If our quarterly operating results or guidance fall below the expectations of research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or guidance may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below:\n\u2022\nfactors affecting our existing customers\u2019 sales processed on our platform, including seasonal factors and fluctuating foreign exchange rates affecting international end consumer demand;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our existing customers renew their agreements to use our solutions and the timing and terms of those renewals;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which new customers are attracted to our solutions to satisfy their ecommerce needs and the timing and rate at which we acquire new customers and implement our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations and development of their own in-house international ecommerce solutions;\n\u2022\nthe number of, and revenue generated by, new customers and the number of, and revenue generated by, renewal customers in a particular period on our platform;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses, including those related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure, including the development of new products, technologies and enhancements to our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new solutions introduced by us, and those of current and new products and services introduced by our competitors;\n\u2022\nother changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, strategic partners or logistics providers;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including increases in the number of customers on our platform, additional customer ecommerce sites, new geographic regions, and our existing and future logistics providers;\n\u2022\nvarious factors related to disruptions in our hosting network infrastructure, defects in our solutions, privacy and data security compliance challenges and exchange rate fluctuations, each of which is described elsewhere in these risk factors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nWe believe that our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to operate internationally and, in part, on our ability to reach our customers\u2019 end consumers located outside of the United States, making us susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe currently ship our customers\u2019 products to end consumers in over 100 countries and territories and settle transactions in more than 60 currencies, and we intend to expand our operations to reach new markets and localities. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks which include:\n\u2022\nlocalization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other barriers, including restrictions on advertising practices, regulations governing online services, restrictions on importation of specified or proscribed items, importation quotas, consumer protection laws, enforcement of intellectual property rights, laws dealing with consumer privacy, data security and data protection, encryption, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n\u2022\nheightened exposure to credit card fraud;\n\u2022\nlegal uncertainty in foreign countries with less developed legal systems;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, embargoes, exchange controls, government controls or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employer/employee relationships;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates that may increase the volatility of our foreign based revenue;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign tax laws (including with respect to value added taxes) and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nlikelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, increases with the increase of sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions and operations in certain industries;\n\u2022\nuncertain political and economic climates in foreign markets; and\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThese factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. Any negative impact from our international business efforts could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition as a whole.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transactions losses.\nWe currently have foreign sales denominated in Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, pounds sterling, euros, Japanese yen and other foreign currencies and, may in the future, have sales denominated in the currencies of additional countries. In addition, we incur a portion of our operating expenses in Israeli new shekels and, to a lesser extent, other foreign currencies. Effective December 2012, we entered into a contract with a third party foreign exchange services provider for currency exchange and remittance services for major currencies, including Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, pounds sterling, euros and Japanese yen, whereby the risk of loss on fluctuation in foreign exchange rates is borne by the third party provider. Although we have limited our risk of loss for major currencies we still may experience losses from fluctuations in exchange rates for sales in other foreign currencies, or upon translation to U.S. dollars expenses incurred in Israeli new shekels for our subsidiary operations, which may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nWe are responsible for all aspects of the international order lifecycle for the products we ship for our customers, including compliance with export control and economic sanctions laws, which include the Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Further, our solutions are subject to these export control and economic sanctions laws, including laws related to transfers of technology, software and source code to non-U.S. persons. If we fail to comply with these U.S. export control laws and import laws, including U.S. Customs regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if we, our customers or our carriers fail to obtain appropriate import, re-import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Furthermore, the U.S. export control laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent any shipments we make from being shipped or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our customers\u2019 products could be shipped to those targets or provided by our carriers despite such precautions. Any such shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our solutions, or the decreased ability to make shipments of our customers\u2019 products. Any decreased use of our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, exercises regulatory jurisdiction over transporting hazardous materials and contraband. Shippers of hazardous materials share responsibility with the air and ground carrier for compliance with these regulations and are primarily responsible for proper packaging and labeling. Customers may fail to inform us about hazardous or illegal cargo even though they are required to do so. If we fail to discover any hazardous or illegal cargo or mislabel or otherwise improperly ship hazardous materials, we may suffer liability, fines and other significant penalties, our relationships with our carriers on whom we rely may be harmed, and we may attract closer regulatory scrutiny from the FAA and other regulatory agencies, which will have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe have in the past been subject to registration as a money services business as a result of offering certain features with our GSS business. While we no longer offer such features with our products as a result of the sale of the GSS business, we may face continuing scrutiny from regulatory authorities as a result of our past conduct or because they have determined that we are still subject to such requirements.\nWe were previously registered as a money services business, or MSB, pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act regulations administered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. We provided currency risk management services for online merchants and internet payment processors and enabled customers to keep account balances with us, and FinCEN had determined that we were acting as a dealer in foreign exchange and engaged in the transmission of funds. We are no longer registered as an MSB with FinCEN because we ceased offering such services, commensurate with the sale of the GSS business, which caused us to register. While we no longer offer those services, we may face continuing scrutiny from regulatory authorities as a result of our past conduct or because our current activities may be determined to subject us to registration as an MSB or licensure as a money transmitter.\nMany people use smartphones and other mobile devices to access information on the internet and if we are not successful in developing effective mobile solutions, or those solutions are not widely adopted, our business could be harmed.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through mobile devices, including smartphones and handheld tablets or computers, has increased significantly in the past few years and is expected to continue to increase. Mobile devices provide our customers an additional channel to offer their products to end-consumers. If we are not able to successfully offer mobile ecommerce solutions to our customers, our ability to grow our business could be harmed.\nAdditionally, as new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing features for these alternative devices and platforms, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such features. In addition, if we experience difficulties in the future in integrating our ecommerce solutions into mobile devices or if problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, our future growth and operating results could suffer. In addition, our customers may face different fraud risks from transactions sent from mobile devices than they do from personal computers. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and manage these fraud risks in our ecommerce solutions, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company, and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the day-to-day management of our business.\nThe individuals who now constitute our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our operations as a public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws. In particular, these new obligations require substantial attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with our initial public offering, we began the process of documenting, reviewing and improving our internal controls and procedures for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will require annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are testing our internal controls in connection with management\u2019s certification related to internal controls as of December 31, 2014 and, as part of that documentation and testing, identifying areas for further attention and improvement. We have been recruiting additional finance and accounting personnel with certain skill sets that we need as a public company.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing processes and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating expenses and harm our business. In addition, investors\u2019 perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price and make it more difficult for us to effectively market and sell our service to new and existing customers.\nWe may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nWe may acquire complementary services, technologies or businesses as part of our business strategy. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our service offerings or our ability to provide service in foreign jurisdictions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies. For example, in January 2015 we completed an acquisition of Bundle Tech Limited. Negotiating these types of transactions is often time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close.\nAn acquisition, investment or new business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, the company\u2019s software is not easily adapted to work with ours or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities. For one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022\nuse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022\nincur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u2022\nincur large charges or substantial liabilities;\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse software codes or business cultures; and\n\u2022\nbecome subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.\nAny of these risks could harm our business and operating results.\nWe depend on existing members of management and key employees to implement key elements in our strategy for growth, and the failure to retain them or to attract appropriately qualified new personnel could affect our ability to implement our growth strategy successfully.\nThe successful implementation of our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and on our ability to attract appropriately qualified new personnel. We are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management team and key technical and sales personnel, such as our president and chief executive officer, our chief financial officer, our chief strategy officer and our chief technology officer. These key employees may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. We currently do not maintain key-person insurance on any members of our management and key employees. The loss of any key member of our management team or other key employees could hinder or delay our ability to implement our growth strategy effectively, and the replacement of these officers likely would involve significant time and costs, and the loss of these officers may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nFurther, if we are unable to attract appropriately qualified new personnel, including in the technical, research and development, and products fields, as we expand over the next few years, we may not be successful in implementing our growth strategy. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology, software, ecommerce and Internet-related companies. For example, our competitors may be able to attract and retain a more qualified engineering team by offering more competitive compensation packages. If we are unable to attract new engineers and retain our current engineers, we may not be able to develop and maintain our services at the same levels as our competitors and we may, therefore, lose potential customers and sales penetration in certain markets. Our failure to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan and, as a result, our ability to compete would decrease, and our operating results would suffer. In addition, if any of our key employees joins a competitor or decides to otherwise compete with us, we may experience a material disruption of our operations and development plans, which may cause us to lose customers or increase operating expenses as the attention of our remaining senior managers is diverted to recruit replacements for the departed key employees.\nProvisions of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nOur credit facility requires us, and any debt instruments we may enter into in the future may require us, to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\ncomplete mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness;\n\u2022\nencumber assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions to holders of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake specified investments;\n\u2022\nchange certain key management personnel; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with our affiliates.\nThese restrictions could inhibit our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we default under our credit facility, and such event of default was not cured or waived, the lenders could terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could result in cross defaults under other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon a default.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The debt instruments governing such indebtedness could contain provisions that are as, or more, restrictive than our existing debt instruments. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness when payment is due, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe rely on insurance to mitigate some risks facing our business, and to the extent our insurance does not mitigate the risks facing our business or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nWe contract for insurance to cover certain potential risks and liabilities, such as general liability, directors' and officers' liability and marine cargo and warehouse losses. It is possible that we may not be able to obtain enough insurance to meet our needs, may have to pay very high prices for the coverage we do obtain, have very high deductibles, may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire any insurance for certain types of business risk. For example, while we maintain standard marine cargo and warehouse insurance that is intended to cover shipping and transportation losses, many events, such as downtime of our platform resulting in significant losses for us and our customers, are not insured and may not be insurable. This could leave us exposed to potential claims. If we were found liable for a significant claim in the future, our business, operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Also, to the extent the cost of maintaining insurance increases, our business, operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be incurred in the future. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us from pending and future claims. In addition, we are required to maintain insurance coverage under some of our agreements with our clients. If we are not able to or do not maintain the required insurance coverage, we could breach those agreements.\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, and if we fail to adhere to their rules and regulations, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and merchant banks, which could subject us to damages and liability and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting credit card payments.\nThe payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards for payment of goods and services. We are obligated to comply with these rules and regulations as part of the contracts we enter into with payment processors and merchant banks. The rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks include the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, or PCI DSS. Under the PCI DSS, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage and security of payment card data to help prevent fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, including the PCI DSS, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply may subject us to fines, penalties, damages, higher transaction fees, and civil liability, loss of certification and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting debit and credit cards or could lead to a loss of payment processor partners. Further, there is no guarantee that even if we comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, we will be able to maintain our compliance. We also cannot guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments systems or the theft, loss or misuse of the debit or credit card data of customers or participants or regulatory or criminal investigations. A failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would result in significantly higher credit card-related costs and any increases in our credit card and debit card fees could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, any such illegal or improper payments could harm our reputation and may result in a loss of service for our customers, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. However, we are electing not to take advantage of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to not take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following completion of our initial public offering, which occurred in March 2014, although if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue, if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of any year, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period before the end of that five-year period, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 31.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nComplying with public company reporting and other obligations may strain our financial and managerial resources, particularly after we cease to be an \"emerging growth company.\"\nPublic company reporting, compliance and corporate governance requirements result in significant initial and continuing legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ impose numerous requirements on public companies, including mandated corporate governance practices such as director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. In addition, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these laws and regulations. As a relatively new public company, these requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, beginning December 31, 2014, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, will require us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect to avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. However, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d When our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, the cost of our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nFurthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these requirements effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting, or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nAfter we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d or sooner if we choose not to take advantage of certain exemptions set forth in the JOBS Act, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In that regard, we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.\nWe are faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.\nWe may be subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in the United States and around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax laws, including increased tax rates or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. In addition, the taxing authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns, or authorities in jurisdictions in which we do not file tax returns could assert that we are subject to tax in such jurisdiction, and in either case could impose additional tax, interest and penalties. Further, the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations.\nTaxing authorities could reallocate our taxable income among our subsidiaries, which could increase our consolidated tax liability.\nWe conduct global operations through subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions pursuant to transfer pricing arrangements among our affiliated entities. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arms\u2019 length and that contemporaneous documentation is maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities. If tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if we have or have had a change in ownership, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $7.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The annual use of our net operating losses may be limited following certain ownership changes under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable state tax law. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change occurred as a result of our initial public offering, or whether there have been one or more ownership changes since our inception, due to the costs and complexities associated with such study. Accordingly, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be currently limited or may be limited as a result of our initial public offering or any future issuance of shares of our stock.\nRisks Related to Data Security and Our Intellectual Property\nSecurity and privacy breaches may hurt our business.\nIn connection with our business, we collect certain personally identifiable information, or personal information, from our customers. Some of this information includes sensitive and/or regulated information, such as credit card information or other payment details. We believe that we take reasonable steps to protect the privacy, security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, use, store, and disclose, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized data access or use will not occur despite our efforts. For example, the personal information and other data that we collect may be subject to unauthorized access, as a result of software bugs, hacking, technical malfunctions, employee error or malfeasance, and/or other factors. Any unauthorized access or use of personal information and other customer data, virus or similar breach or disruption to our, our customers\u2019, or our partners\u2019 systems and security measures as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could result in loss of personal information or other confidential information, damage to our reputation and customer relationships, early termination of our contracts and other business losses, the triggering of obligations to indemnify our customers for any losses that they sustain, financial penalties, litigation, regulatory investigations, and other significant liabilities.\nTechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to personal information, confidential information and/or the systems on which such information are stored and/or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers or suffer other negative consequences to our business. In addition, the vast majority of U.S. states and a number of foreign jurisdictions impose detailed breach notification obligations that would apply in the event of unauthorized access to certain personally identifiable information. In the event we experience a data breach, we could be subject to one or more of these laws which could require us to undertake costly and burdensome notification obligations. Any data breach incidents could also have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\nAny significant violations of data privacy and/or information security could result in the loss of business, litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another ecommerce technology services provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of our business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones. We maintain coverage for third party \u201cCyber Liability\u201d claims. However, in the event of a major third party security incident, we may incur losses in excess of the insurance coverage. Further, certain incidents that we can experience may not be covered by the insurance that we carry.\nWe collect, use, store, and disclose personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy and data security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nAs part of our ecommerce solution that we offer to our customers, we collect, use, store, and disclose personal information and other customer data, including consumers\u2019 mailing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and other contact information, bank account numbers, credit and debit card information, identification numbers and images of government identification cards. We use this data to provide our services to our customers. We also aggregate this data and conduct data analytics based on this aggregated data to gain insights on the global consumer and formulate data-driven marketing and merchandising strategies. As a result, we are required to comply with certain privacy and data security requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards and U.S. state laws concerning privacy and security of personal information. In addition, the European Union, or EU, has traditionally taken a broader view as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy regulations. There are also numerous other federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection, usage, storage, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other applicable rules. It is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules, our business practices, or our contractual commitments to our customers.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues worldwide is evolving. The U.S. federal government and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable information. Numerous foreign jurisdictions, including all countries that are member states of the EU, have adopted legislation that impose stringent restrictions on the collection, usage, storage, disclosure, security and deletion of personal information. In addition, individual EU member states have had discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of certain requirements of European Directives. This has resulted in variation of privacy and data security standards from country to country within the European Union. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. A failure to comply fully with applicable foreign legal requirements could result in fines and other liabilities, negative publicity and loss of business.\nU.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. A number of proposals are pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business. Within the EU, for example, legislators have proposed a new data protection regulation that would substantially overhaul the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive. European lawmakers are continuing to evaluate the numerous amendments that have been proposed to the regulation and, as a result, implementation of the new measure may be delayed to 2016 or later. Once implemented, however, the new regulation is expected to introduce stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal information and impose significant penalties for non-compliance. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations or our policies, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, defense costs and other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers\u2019 ability to collect, use, store and share consumer data or our ability to use, store and disclose personal information and/or other data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solution could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe could be required to stop selling or using a product or service and/or incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of violation of another party\u2019s intellectual property or proprietary rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights. Companies providing Internet-related products and services are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties, which we refer to as non-practicing entities, whose primary business is to assert such claims. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third party that claims that our business violates its rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources.\nIn addition, in most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our customers against certain claims that our products and services violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. Our business could be adversely affected by any significant disputes between us and our customers as to the applicability or scope of our indemnification obligations to them. The results of any litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease making, selling offering for sale or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nmake substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n\u2022\nredesign those products or services to avoid infringement.\nIf we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results.\nWe could incur substantial costs in protecting our intellectual property from infringement, and any failure to protect our intellectual property could impair our business.\nWe seek to protect the source code for our proprietary software under a combination of patent, copyright and trade secrets law. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our proprietary software is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents, copyrights or trade secrets that cover these activities. However, because we make some of the source code available to some customers, third parties may be more likely to misappropriate it. Our policy is to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers and to control access to our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for someone to copy our software or other proprietary information without authorization or to develop similar software independently.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our platform or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our platform is difficult, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software exists, we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, result in a diversion of resources, the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. These steps may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our platform and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our platform may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our platform and proprietary information may increase.\nThere can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property, then our business, brand, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could negatively affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nA portion of the technologies licensed by us incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our solutions. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products.\nWe rely on third-party software, including server software and licenses from third parties to use patented intellectual property that is required for the development of our solutions, which may be difficult to obtain or which could cause errors or failures of our solutions.\nWe rely on software licensed from or hosted by third parties to offer our solutions. In addition, we may need to obtain future licenses from third parties to use intellectual property associated with the development of our solutions, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any inability to obtain or loss of the right to use any software required for the development and maintenance of our solutions could prevent us from providing our solutions or result in delays in the provision of our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third-party software could result in errors or a failure of our solutions which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may be volatile in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations, and it may decline below the price at which you purchased your shares, in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results or financial guidance or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us or developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations with respect to our stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or securities;\n\u2022\nexpiration of contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors discussed in these Risk Factors.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Because of the past and potential future volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nWe may need financing in the future, and any additional financing may result in restrictions on our operations or substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may need to raise funds in the future, for example, to develop new technologies, expand our business, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses, or respond to unanticipated situations. We may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. Our ability to obtain debt or equity funding will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, and investor interest. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to reduce expenditures, including curtailing our growth strategies, foregoing acquisitions, or reducing our product development efforts. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-based securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these new securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. The terms of these securities, as well as any borrowings under our credit agreement, could impose restrictions on our operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 64.6% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, could have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and over the management and affairs of our company. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management and may limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nproviding that vacancies may only be filled by the remaining directors;\n\u2022\npreventing the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nproviding for a supermajority requirement to amend our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablishing the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for any legal actions.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the state of Delaware, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. In addition, our credit facility prohibits, and future debt instruments may materially restrict, us from declaring or paying cash dividends on our capital stock.", "PERMNO": 14537, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "BRDR"}
