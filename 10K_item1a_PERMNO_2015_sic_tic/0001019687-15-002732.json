{"cik": "704562", "company": "PEREGRINE PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking information based on our current expectations. Because our actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our actual future results, including, but not limited to, our potential product sales, potential royalties, contract manufacturing revenues, expenses, net income(loss) and earnings(loss) per common share.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we cannot obtain additional funding, our product development and commercialization efforts may be reduced or discontinued and we may not be able to continue operations or timely complete our phase iii SUNRISE trial.\nAt April 30, 2015, we had $68,001,000 in cash and cash equivalents. We have expended substantial funds on the research and development of our product candidates, and funding the operations of Avid. As a result, we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect negative cash flows from operations to continue in the foreseeable future. Therefore, unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenue from Avid\u2019s contract manufacturing services and/or from the sale and/or licensing of our product candidates under development, we expect such negative cash flows to continue in the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to continue to fund our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods, including but not limited to, (i) raising additional capital in the equity markets, (ii) licensing or partnering our product candidates in development, or (iii) generating additional revenue from Avid.\nHistorically, we have funded a significant portion of our operations through the issuance of equity. During fiscal year 2015, we raised $19,748,000 in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock and raised an additional $19,205,000 in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of our 10.5% Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d) (as described in Note 6 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to April 30, 2015 and through July 14, 2015, we raised an additional $8,896,000 in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock (as described in Note 13 to the accompanying audited financial statements). As of July 14, 2015, $151,651,000 remained available to us under our two effective shelf registration statements, which allows us from time to time to offer and sell shares of our common stock or preferred stock, in one or more offerings, either individually or in combination.\nAlthough we believe we can raise sufficient capital to meet our obligations through fiscal year 2016, our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets to fund our obligations in future periods is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the market demand for our common stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock. The market demand or liquidity of our common stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, negative economic conditions, adverse market conditions, adverse clinical trial results and significant delays in one or more clinical trials. If we are unable to either (i) raise sufficient capital in the equity markets, (ii) license or partner our products in development, or (iii) generate additional revenue from Avid, or any combination thereof, we may need to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all our research and development efforts, delay the commercial launch of bavituximab, if approved, and/or restructure our operations. In addition, even if we are able to raise additional capital, it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us.\nIn addition, based on our current projections, which include but are not limited to, projected expenses associated with our Phase III SUNRISE trial, projected expenses associated with our anticipated new clinical trials, projected payments of dividends on our issued and outstanding Series E Preferred Stock, projected cash receipts under signed commitments with existing customers of Avid, and assuming we raise no additional capital from the capital markets or other potential sources, we believe we will have sufficient cash on hand to meet our obligations as they become due through at least February 2016. Notwithstanding, we will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund certain of our operations beyond February 2016, including our Phase III SUNRISE trial. There are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections, including but not limited to, termination of Avid customer contracts, technical challenges and the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future clinical trial, any of which could reduce, delay or accelerate our future projected cash inflows and outflows. In addition, in the event our projected cash-inflows are reduced or delayed, we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through February 2016 unless we raise additional capital. The uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, and as a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report accompanying our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2015 with respect to this uncertainty.\nWe have had significant losses and we anticipate future losses.\nWe have incurred net losses in most fiscal years since we began operations in 1981. The following table represents net losses incurred for each of the past three fiscal years:\nAs of April 30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $453,624,000. While we expect to continue to generate revenue from Avid\u2019s contract manufacturing services, in order to achieve and sustain profitable operations, we must successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, either alone or with others, and following any such approval, must also manufacture, introduce, market and sell our product candidates. The costs associated with clinical trials and product manufacturing are very substantial and the time frame necessary to achieve market success for our product candidates is long and uncertain. Furthermore, the costs associated with advanced stage clinical trials can significantly increase due, in part, to expanded patient populations and the cost to prepare for potential commercialization. In addition, as we continue to advance our Phase III SUNRISE trial and initiate additional clinical trials, we expect our net loss for fiscal year 2016 to exceed our net loss for fiscal year 2015. We do not expect to generate product or royalty revenues for at least the next two years, and we may never generate product and/or royalty revenues sufficient to become profitable or to sustain profitability.\nSuccessful development of our product candidates is uncertain. To date, no revenues have been generated from the commercial sale of our product candidates and our product candidates may not generate revenues in the future.\nOur development of current and future product candidates is subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products and products based on new technologies. These risks include:\n\u00b7 delays in product development, clinical testing or manufacturing;\n\u00b7 unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing or manufacturing;\n\u00b7 failure in clinical trials or failure to receive regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 emergence of superior or equivalent products;\n\u00b7 inability to manufacture on our own, or through others, product candidates on a commercial scale;\n\u00b7 inability to market products due to third party proprietary rights; and\n\u00b7 failure to achieve market acceptance.\nBecause of these risks, our research and development efforts or those of our potential partners may not result in any commercially viable products. If significant portions of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained, or any approved products are not commercially successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nBecause we have not begun the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, our revenue and profit potential is unproven and our operating history makes it difficult for an investor to evaluate our business and prospects. Our technology may not result in any meaningful benefits to our current or potential partners. No revenues have been generated from the commercial sale of our product candidates, and our products may not generate revenues in the future. Our business and prospects should be considered in light of the heightened risks and unexpected expenses and problems we may face as a company in an early stage of product development in an extremely competitive and rapidly evolving industry.\nWe are primarily focusing our activities and resources on the development of bavituximab and depend on its success.\nWe are focusing most of our near-term research and development activities and resources on bavituximab, and we believe a significant portion of the value of our company relates to our ability to develop this drug candidate. The development of bavituximab is subject to many risks, including the risks discussed in other risk factors. If the results of clinical trials of bavituximab, including our Phase III SUNRISE trial, the regulatory decisions affecting bavituximab, the anticipated or actual timing and plan for commercializing bavituximab, or, ultimately, the market acceptance of bavituximab do not meet our, your, analysts or others\u2019 expectations, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur product development efforts may not be successful.\nOur product candidates have not received regulatory approval and are in research, preclinical and various clinical stages of development. If the results from any of the clinical trials are not positive, those results may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or obtain regulatory approval to conduct additional clinical trials, which will affect our ability to continue full-scale research and development for our antibody technologies. In addition, our product candidates may take longer than anticipated to progress through clinical trials, or patient enrollment in the clinical trials may be delayed or prolonged significantly, thus delaying the clinical trials.\nClinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.\nIn order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product, we or our potential partners must demonstrate proof of safety and efficacy in humans. To meet these requirements, we or our potential partners will have to conduct extensive preclinical testing and \u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d clinical trials. Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial. Delays associated with products for which we are directly conducting preclinical or clinical trials may cause us to incur additional operating expenses. Moreover, we may continue to be affected by delays associated with the preclinical testing and clinical trials of certain product candidates conducted by our potential partners over which we have no control. The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including, for example:\n\u00b7 obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites, particularly those in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 slower than expected rates of patient recruitment due to narrow screening requirements;\n\u00b7 the inability of patients to meet FDA or other regulatory authorities\u2019 imposed protocol requirements;\n\u00b7 the inability to retain patients who have initiated participation in a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to various clinical or personal reasons, or who are lost to further follow-up;\n\u00b7 the inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under cGMPs for use in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 shortages of chemotherapy or other drugs used in clinical trials in combination with bavituximab;\n\u00b7 the need or desire to modify our manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 the inability to adequately observe patients after treatment;\n\u00b7 changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the lack of effectiveness during the clinical trials;\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 delays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the institutional review board responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site;\n\u00b7 insufficient financial resources; and\n\u00b7 government or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of the trials.\nEven if we obtain positive results from preclinical or initial clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future trials. Clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically sufficient safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates employing our technology.\nClinical trials that we conduct or that third parties conduct on our behalf may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates. We expect to commence new clinical trials from time to time in the course of our business as our product development work continues. The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for our desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate as well as other product candidates. Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our preclinical studies. If those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all.\nIn the course of our discovery, preclinical testing and clinical trials, we rely on third parties, including universities, investigators and CROs, to perform critical services for us. For example, we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our preclinical studies. CROs and investigators are responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling patients for testing and administering the trials. Our double-blind Phase III SUNRISE trial design is similar to our prior Phase IIb second-line NSCLC trial design in that management does not have access to certain information regarding the trial\u2019s administration and progress. We therefore must rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, but their failure to comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements, or to perform their services in a timely and acceptable manner, may compromise our clinical trials in particular or our business in general. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices (\u201cGCPs\u201d) for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial patients are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not be available when we need them or, if they are available, may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner. Any failings by these third parties may compromise our clinical trials in particular or our business in general. Similarly, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. These independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. For example, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with our clinical trial protocols, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated. As a result of our dependence on third parties, we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control, as evidenced by the major discrepancies in treatment group coding by an independent third-party vendor responsible for distribution of blinded investigational product used in our bavituximab Phase II NSCLC trial. These risks also apply to the development activities of our collaborators, and we do not control our collaborators\u2019 research and development, clinical trials or regulatory activities. We do not expect any drugs resulting from our collaborators\u2019 research and development efforts to be commercially available for at least two (2) or more years, if ever.\nIn addition, we have prepaid research and development expenses to third parties that have been deferred and capitalized as pre-payments to secure the receipt of future preclinical and clinical research and development services. These pre-payments are recognized as an expense in the period that the services are performed. We assess our prepaid research and development expenses for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the prepaid expense may not be recoverable or provide a future economic benefit, including the risk of third party nonperformance. If there are indicators that the third parties are unable to perform the research and development services, we may be required to take an impairment charge.\nWe have limited experience as a company conducting large-scale clinical trials.\nResults from early stage clinical trials of bavituximab may not be indicative of successful outcomes in later stage trials. Negative or limited results from any current or future clinical trial could delay or prevent further development of our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe have limited experience as a company in conducting large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, and our experience with early-stage clinical trials with small numbers of patients is limited. In part because of this limited experience, we cannot be certain that planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time, if at all. Large-scale trials require significant additional financial and management resources, and reliance on third-party clinical investigators, CROs or consultants. Relying on third-party clinical investigators or CROs may force us to encounter delays that are outside of our control. Any such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing products. If we decide to develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, it will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. In addition, we will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel. If we decide to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products, we may not be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, our collaborators may not have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We will also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nWe may not be able to develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product in the United States or overseas.\nFailure to recruit, enroll and retain patients for clinical trials may cause the development of our product candidates to be delayed or development costs to increase substantially.\nWe have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, delays in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u00b7 the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u00b7 the proximity of patients to study sites;\n\u00b7 the design of the trial;\n\u00b7 our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u00b7 the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion; and\n\u00b7 competition for patients by clinical trial programs for other competitive treatments.\nOur clinical trials compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition reduces the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which reduces the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. Delays in patient enrollment in the future as a result of these and other factors may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our clinical trials, which could prevent us from completing these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates.\nPatient enrollment and patient care provided at international clinical sites may be delayed or otherwise adversely impacted by social, political and economic factors affecting the particular foreign country.\nIn the past, we have conducted, and are presently conducting in connection with our Phase III SUNRISE trial, clinical trials globally including clinical sites in Western and Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific and other regions and/or countries. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n\u00b7 difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with CROs and physicians;\n\u00b7 different standards for the conduct of clinical trials and/or health care reimbursement;\n\u00b7 our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians, and partners;\n\u00b7 the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical products and treatment; and\n\u00b7 general geopolitical risks, such as political and economic instability, and changes in diplomatic and trade relations.\nBecause we are conducting our Phase III SUNRISE trial in several foreign counties, any disruption to our international clinical trial sites could significantly delay or jeopardize our product development efforts.\nSuccess in early clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials.\nA number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in initial clinical trials, but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and effectiveness data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nData from our preclinical studies and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials should not be relied upon as evidence that later or larger-scale clinical trials will succeed. The Phase I studies we have completed to date have been designed to primarily assess safety in a small number of patients. In addition, the results we have obtained in the Phase II trials may not predict results for any future studies and may not predict future therapeutic benefit of our drug candidates. We are required to demonstrate through larger-scale clinical trials, such as our ongoing Phase III SUNRISE trial, that bavituximab is safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek regulatory approval for its commercial sale. There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials.\nIn addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.\nIf we successfully develop products but those products do not achieve and maintain market acceptance, our business will not be profitable.\nEven if the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve bavituximab or any future product candidate for commercial sale, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by physicians, healthcare professionals and third-party payors and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u00b7 changes in the standard of care for the targeted indication;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u00b7 availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 pricing and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;\n\u00b7 effectiveness of our or our partners\u2019 sales and marketing strategy;\n\u00b7 the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries; and\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIn addition, if bavituximab or any future product candidate that we discover and develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is more beneficial than the current standard of care or otherwise provide patient benefit, that product likely will not be accepted favorably by the market. If any products we may develop do not achieve market acceptance, then we may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIn addition, even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or render our products obsolete.\nIf we do not establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development plans.\nOur drug development programs and potential commercialization of our drug candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund our operations. We in-licensed all rights to our lead drug candidate, bavituximab, and are fully responsible for the associated development costs. Our strategy continues to include the potential of selectively collaborating with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to assist us in furthering development and potential commercialization of some of our product candidates and research programs. We may enter into one or more of such collaborations in the future, especially for target indications in which the potential collaborator has particular therapeutic expertise or that involve a large, primary care market that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations or for markets outside of North America. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and these collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we successfully enter into a collaboration, our partner may not perform its contractual obligations or may terminate the agreement. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nHealthcare reform measures and other statutory or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d), enacted in March 2010, substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare D program.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to extensive regulation, and from time to time legislative bodies and governmental agencies consider changes to such regulations that could have significant impact on industry participants. For example, in light of certain highly-publicized safety issues regarding certain drugs that had received marketing approval, the U.S. Congress has considered various proposals regarding drug safety, including some which would require additional safety studies and monitoring and could make drug development more costly. Additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to safety or other aspects of drug development may be enacted in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved drugs is uncertain, and failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement could limit our ability to market bavituximab and may decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. The commercial success of our product candidates, including bavituximab, in both domestic and international markets will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and managed care organizations. Government and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. These payors may conclude that our product candidates are less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing or later introduced products, and third-party payors may not approve our product candidates for coverage and reimbursement or may cease providing coverage and reimbursement for these product candidates. Because each country has one or more payment systems, obtaining reimbursement in the United States and internationally may take significant time and cause us to spend significant resources. The failure to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates or healthcare cost containment initiatives that limit or deny reimbursement for our product candidates may significantly reduce any future product revenue.\nIn the United States and in other countries, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business. International, federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. The U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform, as evidenced by the ACA. Such government-adopted reform measures may adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third-party payors. In addition, in some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. The continuing efforts of U.S. and other governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce healthcare costs may adversely affect our ability to set satisfactory prices for our products, to generate revenues, and to achieve and maintain profitability.\nIn some countries, particularly in the European Union, prescription drug pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability of our products in such country.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, physician payment transparency laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7 federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization;\n\u00b7 the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u00b7 federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.\nAdditionally, we are or may become subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. As a result of such amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing bavituximab abroad.\nWe intend to market bavituximab in international markets either directly or through a potential future collaboration partner, if any. In order to market bavituximab in the European Union, Canada, Japan and many other foreign jurisdictions, we or a potential future collaboration partner must obtain separate regulatory approvals. We have, and potential future collaboration partners may have, had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities, and the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing at significant cost. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval processes may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in some foreign countries where we may not have conducted clinical studies (or treated a sufficient number of patients), the applicable foreign regulatory agency may require us to conduct additional studies in its country to establish the safety of our drug in that patient population, which could delay the approval process in that foreign country. We or a potential future collaboration partner may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nForeign governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market bavituximab in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions either directly or through a potential future collaboration partner. If we or a potential future collaboration partner obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we or a potential future collaboration partner will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to bavituximab. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, prescription drug pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or a potential future collaboration partner may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of bavituximab to other available therapies. If reimbursement of bavituximab is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nObtaining Fast Track designation from the FDA for our product candidate bavituximab does not guarantee faster approval.\nWe received Fast Track designation for our product candidate bavituximab in combination with docetaxel in patients with previously-treated non-squamous NSCLC. Fast Track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and that have the potential to address an unmet medical need for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Once a Fast Track designation is obtained, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA before the complete application is submitted if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA and the applicant pays applicable user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. However, the time period specified in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which governs the time period goals the FDA has committed to reviewing an application, does not begin until the complete application is accepted for filing. Although we received Fast Track designation for bavituximab, the FDA may later decide that bavituximab no longer meets the conditions for qualification. In addition, Fast Track designation may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.\nOur manufacturing facilities may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity.\nBefore approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA requires that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured comply with cGMP requirements. To be successful, our therapeutic products must be manufactured for development and, following approval, in commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs. Currently, we manufacture all preclinical and clinical material through Avid, our wholly-owned subsidiary. While we believe our current facilities are adequate for the manufacturing of our product candidates for clinical trials, our current facilities may not be adequate to produce sufficient quantities required for commercialization, which is largely due to manufacturing capacity utilized by Avid\u2019s third-party customers.\nIn order to prepare for potential commercialization, during fiscal year 2015, we commenced the construction of a manufacturing cleanroom to accommodate both the commercial manufacturing of bavituximab, if regulatory approval is obtained, while also providing additional manufacturing capacity to grow Avid\u2019s contract manufacturing business. While we believe we have the ability to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity to support the commercial manufacturing of bavituximab, the manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies, like bavituximab, is a lengthy and costly process which the FDA must review and approve prior to commercialization. In addition, quality issues may arise during manufacturing because of the complexities inherent in the manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies. If we are unable to successfully manufacture bavituximab in sufficient quality and quantity in the new manufacturing cleanroom, the development of bavituximab and its regulatory approval or commercial launch, if approved for sale, may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply, which could significantly harm our business. Although we are not presently seeking a secondary source for the potential commercial production of bavituximab, if we were to engage a third-party manufacturer, we would need to transfer our technology to that third-party manufacturer and gain FDA approval, potentially causing significant delays in product delivery. In addition, if we use a third-party manufacturer, it may not perform as agreed or may terminate its agreement with us.\nWe may also encounter problems with the following:\n\u00b7 production yields;\n\u00b7 possible facility contamination;\n\u00b7 quality control and quality assurance programs;\n\u00b7 shortages of qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 compliance with FDA or other regulatory authorities regulations, including the demonstration of purity and potency;\n\u00b7 changes in FDA or other regulatory authorities requirements;\n\u00b7 production costs; and/or\n\u00b7 development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls.\nIn addition, we will be required to register the manufacturing facility with the FDA and other regulatory authorities, provided it had not already registered. The facility will be subject to inspections confirming compliance with cGMP or other regulations. If we fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nWe presently rely on a limited number of vendors for certain raw materials critical to the manufacture of bavituximab.\nManufacturing of bavituximab requires many raw materials and we currently depend on a limited number of vendors for certain materials used in the manufacture thereof. We also do not have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers and may not be able to obtain supply contracts with them on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving raw materials to support clinical or commercial manufacturing, if approved.\nFor some of these raw materials, we currently rely, and may in the future rely, on sole source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. If we are unable to continue to source product from any of these suppliers due to, for example, regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demand, or quality issues, we could be unable to satisfy demand for bavituximab, if approved, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur clinical trials, research and development activities and manufacturing operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials or chemicals. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure because we maintain only limited product liability insurance.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the administration of one of our product candidates during a clinical trial adversely affects or causes the death of a patient. Although we maintain product liability insurance for clinical studies in the amount of $5,000,000 per occurrence or $5,000,000 in the aggregate on a claims-made basis, as well as country-specific coverage where required for clinical sites located in foreign countries, our coverage may not be adequate. Product liability insurance is expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, or a product recall, could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, the contract manufacturing services that we offer through Avid expose us to an inherent risk of liability as the antibodies or other substances manufactured by Avid, at the request and to the specifications of our customers, could possibly cause adverse effects or have product defects. We obtain agreements from our customers indemnifying and defending us from any potential liability arising from such risk. However, these indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against potential claims relating to such contract manufacturing services or protect us from being named in a possible lawsuit. Although Avid has procured insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain our existing coverage or obtain additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential claims to which we might be exposed. A partially successful or completely uninsured claim against Avid could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur research and development activities rely on technology licensed from third parties, and termination of any of those licenses would result in loss of significant rights to develop and market our products, which would impair our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been granted rights to a variety of technologies necessary for our research and development activities from third parties through license agreements. Each license generally may be terminated by the licensor if we fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, including obligations to develop the product candidates or technologies under license. If terminated, we would lose the right to develop the product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The license agreements also generally require us to meet specified milestones or show reasonable diligence in development of the technology. If disputes arise over the definition of these requirements or whether we have satisfied the requirements in a timely manner, or if any other obligations in the license agreements are disputed by the other party, the other party could terminate the agreement, and we could lose our rights to develop the licensed technology.\nIn addition, if new technology is developed from these licenses, we may be required to negotiate certain key financial and other terms, such as milestone and royalty payments, for the licensing of this future technology with the third party licensors, and it might not be possible to obtain any such license on terms that are satisfactory to us, or at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain, protect and enforce our patent rights, we may be unable to effectively protect or exploit our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain, protect and enforce commercially valuable patents. We try to protect our proprietary positions by filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to developing our business. However, if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements, our competitors could develop and commercialize products that would otherwise infringe upon our patents.\nOur patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical fields are still evolving. Accordingly, the degree of future protection for our patent rights is uncertain. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents include the following:\n\u00b7 the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 the claims of any patents that issue may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7 the patents licensed or issued to us may not provide a competitive advantage;\n\u00b7 other parties may challenge patents licensed or issued to us;\n\u00b7 disputes may arise regarding the invention and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us, our licensors, corporate partners and other scientific collaborators; and\n\u00b7 other parties may design around our patented technologies.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely impacted.\nThe patent protection for our product candidates may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our product candidates have varying expiration dates and, if these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs or market any of our approved products profitably. For example, one of our U.S. patents claims compounds encompassing bavituximab and is due to expire in 2024, and two of our other U.S. patents claim treatment methods encompassing bavituximab and are due to expire in 2025. In some of the larger potential market territories, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension or restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of the product\u2019s development and regulatory review. However, such an extension may not be granted, or if granted, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extension period may not be sufficient to maximize the commercial value of the patent(s). In addition, even though some regulatory authorities may provide some other exclusivity for a product under their own laws and regulations, we may not be able to qualify the product or obtain the exclusive time period. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other exclusivity, we could be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient time to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and non-U.S. patents.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive, time consuming and may lead to disclosure of our confidential information.\nIn order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties. In addition, we may become subject to interference, opposition or other post-grant review proceedings conducted in patent and trademark offices to determine the priority and/or patentability of inventions. The defense of intellectual property rights, including patent rights through lawsuits, interference, opposition or other post-grant review proceedings and other legal and administrative proceedings, would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our pending patent applications at risk of not being issued.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. For example, during the course of this kind of litigation, confidential information may be inadvertently disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests, depositions or trial testimony. This disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we have limited insurance or are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our ability to obtain raw materials for the manufacture of our clinical supplies and for our third party customers\u2019 products, for which we act as a contract manufacturer, could be disrupted, if the operations of these suppliers is affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. Our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility is located in California near major earthquake faults. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster.\nWe may not be able to compete with our competitors in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries because many of them have greater resources than we do and they are further along in their development efforts.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and any product candidate developed by us would compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to cancer therapy.\nIn addition, we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in research and development of immunotherapy-based products that have commenced clinical trials with, or have successfully commercialized, these products. Some or all of these companies may have greater financial resources, larger technical staffs and larger research budgets than we have, as well as greater experience in developing products and running clinical trials. We expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future. In addition, there may be other companies which are currently developing competitive technologies and products or which may in the future develop technologies and products that are comparable or superior to our technologies and products.\nOur lead immunotherapy product, bavituximab, is currently in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment NSCLC. Most common drugs currently used in the treatment of NSCLC with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy include docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent from Sanofi-Aventis, erlotinib, a targeted small molecule from Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo\u00ae) by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and pemetrexed, a chemotherapeutic agent from Eli Lilly & Company. In addition, although we are not aware of any other PS-targeting immunotherapies in clinical development, there are a number of investigational products in development for the treatment of NSCLC, including but not limited to Imprime PGG by Biothera, pembrolizumab (marketed as Keytruda\u00ae) by Merck & Co., MEDI-4736 by AstraZeneca plc, and MPDL3820A by Roche.\nOur contract manufacturing business is exposed to risks resulting from its small customer base.\nA significant portion of Avid\u2019s revenues has historically been derived from a small number of customers. These customers typically do not enter into long-term commitments because their need for drug supply depends on a variety of factors, including the drug\u2019s stage of development, their financial resources, and, with respect to commercial drugs, demand for the drug in the market. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from any one of our primary customers is significantly reduced or eliminated.\nIf we lose qualified management and scientific personnel or are unable to attract and retain such personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our products or we may be significantly delayed in developing our products.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon a limited number of key executive officers, each of whom is an at-will employee, and upon our scientific researchers. For example, because of his extensive understanding of our technologies and product development programs, the loss of Mr. Steven W. King, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would adversely affect our development efforts and clinical trial programs during the six- to twelve-month period that we estimate it would take to find a qualified replacement.\nWe also believe that our future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled research and development and technical personnel. We face intense competition in our recruiting activities, including competition from larger companies with greater resources. We do not know if we will be successful in attracting or retaining skilled personnel. The loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could negatively affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carry forwards which, if we were to become profitable, could be used to offset/defer federal and state income taxes. Our ability to use such carry forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations related to changes in ownership of our stock.\nAs of April 30, 2015, we had federal and state NOL carry forwards of approximately $337 million and $247 million, respectively, expiring from 2016 to 2035. These NOL carry forwards could potentially be used to offset certain future federal and state income tax liabilities. However, utilization of NOL carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. We performed a detailed analysis of our NOL carry forwards through April 30, 2015 and it was determined that no change in ownership had occurred. As a result of this analysis, we currently do not believe any Section 382 limitations will significantly impact our ability to offset income with available NOL carry forwards. However, future ownership changes under Section 382 may limit our ability to fully utilize these tax benefits. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the carry forwards before utilization. If we were not able to utilize our carry forwards, we would be required to use our cash resources to pay taxes that would otherwise have been offset, thereby reducing our liquidity.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our third-party collaborators, CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party collaborators, CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on our third-party collaborators and other third parties for research and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and/or suffer substantial reputational harm and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur governance documents and state law provide certain anti-takeover measures which will discourage a third party from seeking to acquire us unless approved by the Board of Directors.\nWe adopted a shareholder rights plan, commonly referred to as a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d on March 16, 2006. The purpose of the shareholder rights plan is to protect stockholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer a fair price to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. Under the plan, the acquisition of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock by any person or group, unless approved by our board of directors, will trigger the right of our stockholders (other than the acquirer of 15% or more of our common stock) to acquire additional shares of our common stock, and, in certain cases, the stock of the potential acquirer, at a 50% discount to market price, thus significantly increasing the acquisition cost to a potential acquirer. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain certain additional anti-takeover protective devices. For example,\n\u00b7 no stockholder action may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote; solicitations by consent are thus prohibited;\n\u00b7 special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors; and\n\u00b7 our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to fix the rights and preferences, and issue shares, of preferred stock. An issuance of preferred stock with dividend and liquidation rights senior to the common stock and convertible into a large number of shares of common stock could prevent a potential acquirer from gaining effective economic or voting control.\nFurther, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, restricts certain transactions and business combinations between a corporation and a stockholder owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from the date the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder.\nAlthough we believe these provisions and our rights plan collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nOur bylaws, as amended, provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws, as amended, provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Although the Delaware State Legislature has approved of amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizing such choice of forum provisions in the charters or bylaws of Delaware corporations, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and certain of our current and former executive officers and one consultant have been named as defendants in litigation that could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention.\nBeginning in September 2012, several lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our executive officers, consultants and directors on behalf of certain purchasers of our common stock. The lawsuits in general include allegations that we and certain of our executive officer, consultants and directors violated federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements regarding the interim results of our bavituximab Phase II second-line NSCLC trial, thereby artificially inflating the price of our common stock. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages and other relief.\nWe may not be successful in defending these lawsuits. Also, our insurance coverage may be insufficient, our assets may be insufficient to cover any amounts that exceed our insurance coverage, and we may have to pay damage awards or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with such claims. A settlement of the lawsuit could involve the issuance of common stock or other equity, which may dilute your ownership interest. Any payments or settlement arrangements could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition or your ownership interest. Even if lead plaintiff\u2019s claims are not successful, this litigation could result in substantial costs and significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or partnering efforts. In addition, such consolidated lawsuit may make it more difficult to finance our operations, obtain certain types of insurance (including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance), and attract and retain qualified executive officers, other employees and directors.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe sale of substantial shares of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nAs of April 30, 2015, there were 193,346,627 shares of our common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares are eligible for trading in the public market, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations. The market price of our common stock may decline if our common stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur.\nIn addition, our common stock outstanding as of April 30, 2015 excludes the following common shares reserved for future issuance:\n\u00b7 24,880,481 common shares reserved for issuance under outstanding option grants and available for issuance under our stock incentive plans;\n\u00b7 2,443,056 common shares reserved for and available for issuance under our 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201cEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\u201d);\n\u00b7 273,280 common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants; and\n\u00b7 45,668,156 common shares issuable upon conversion of our outstanding Series E Preferred Stock.\nOf the total options and warrants outstanding as of April 30, 2015, 8,196,188 would be considered dilutive to stockholders because we would receive an amount per share, which is less than the market price of our common stock at April 30, 2015.\nIn addition, we will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations, including our Phase III SUNRISE trial. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the market price of our securities may decline and our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nOur highly volatile stock price may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock and the market prices of securities of companies in the biotechnology sector have generally been highly volatile and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. For instance, the market price of our common stock has ranged from $0.42 to $5.50 per share over the last three fiscal years ended April 30, 2015.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock may be significantly impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the success or failure of our internal drug development efforts;\n\u00b7 positive or negative data reported on programs in clinical trials we or our investigators are conducting;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 uncertainties about our ability to continue to fund our operations beyond February 2016, including our Phase III SUNRISE trial;\n\u00b7 significant changes in our financial results or that of our competitors, including our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u00b7 the offering and sale of shares of our common stock, either sold at market prices or at a discount under an equity transaction;\n\u00b7 significant changes in our capital structure;\n\u00b7 published reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 announcements of partnering transactions, licensing agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and any other transaction that involves the development, sale or use of our technologies or competitive technologies;\n\u00b7 developments and/or disputes concerning our patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments, including possible delays, and product safety concerns;\n\u00b7 outcomes of significant litigation, disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings;\n\u00b7 general stock trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry sectors;\n\u00b7 public concerns as to the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u00b7 economic trends and other external factors, including but not limited to, interest rate fluctuations, economic recession, inflation, foreign market trends, national crisis, and disasters; and\n\u00b7 healthcare reimbursement reform and cost-containment measures implemented by government agencies.\nThese and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock, and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nIf we fail to meet continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on NASDAQ. In particular, NASDAQ rules require us to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock. If the closing bid price of our common stock were to fall below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days or we do not meet other listing requirements, we would fail to be in compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing standards. We may not continue to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC may initiate the delisting process with a notification letter. If we were to receive such a notification, we would be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of our common stock would need to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nadditional Risks Related to the Ownership of our Series E Preferred Stock\nWe may not be able to pay dividends on the series e preferred stock.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law, or if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. In addition, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our Series E Preferred Stock.\nThe market price of the Series E Preferred Stock could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market price of the Series E Preferred Stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:\n\u00b7 prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series E Preferred Stock;\n\u00b7 trading prices of common and preferred equity securities issued by other biopharmaceutical companies;\n\u00b7 the annual yield from distributions on the Series E Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 publicity regarding actual or potential company-sponsored clinical trial and investigator-sponsored clinical trial results relating to products under development by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements of licensing agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and any other transaction that involves the development, sale or use of our technologies;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments and product safety concerns;\n\u00b7 general economic and financial market conditions;\n\u00b7 government action or regulation;\n\u00b7 significant changes in the financial condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors in our industry;\n\u00b7 our issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities; and\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.\nAs a result of these and other factors, holders of our Series E Preferred Stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market price of the Series E Preferred Stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.", "PERMNO": 12266, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CDMO"}
