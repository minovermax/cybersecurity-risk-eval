{"cik": "1303330", "company": "China Housing & Land Development, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this annual report before purchasing any of our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may also adversely impair our business operations. If any of the events described in the risk factors below actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer significantly. In such case, the value of your investment could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our securities.\nIn addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the SEC, there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement. Some of these important factors, but not necessarily all important factors, include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur home sales and operating revenues could decline due to macro-economic and other factors outside of our control, such as changes in consumer confidence and declines in employment levels.\nThe real estate market in China is susceptible to fluctuations in economic conditions. Our business substantially depends on the prevailing economic conditions in China. Changes in national and regional economic conditions, as well as local economic conditions where the Company conducts its operations and where prospective purchasers of its homes live, may result in more caution on the part of homebuyers and consequently fewer home purchases. These economic uncertainties involve, among other things, conditions of supply and demand in local markets and changes in consumer confidence and income, employment levels, and government regulations. These risks and uncertainties could periodically have an adverse effect on consumer demand for and the pricing of our homes, which could cause our operating revenues to decline. In addition, builders are subject to various risks, many of them outside the control of the homebuilder including competitive overbuilding, availability and cost of building lots, materials and labor, adverse weather conditions, cost overruns, changes in government regulations, and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees. A reduction in our revenues could in turn negatively affect the market price of our securities.\nAn increase in mortgage interest rates or the unavailability of mortgage financing may reduce consumer demand for the Company\u2019s homes.\nVirtually all purchasers of our homes finance their acquisitions through lenders providing mortgage financing. A substantial increase in mortgage interest rates or unavailability of mortgage financing would adversely affect the ability of prospective homebuyers to obtain the financing they would need in order to purchase our homes, as well as adversely affect the ability of prospective upgrading homebuyers to sell their current homes. The availability of mortgage financing and mortgage interest rates are affected by central government policy directed toward the real estate industry. If mortgage financing becomes less available, demand for our homes could decline. A reduction in demand could also have an adverse effect on the pricing of our homes because we and our competitors may reduce prices in an effort to better compete for home buyers. Price reductions could result in a decline in our revenues and in our margins.\nWe could experience a reduction in home sales and revenues or reduced cash flows if we are unable to obtain reasonably priced financing to support our homebuilding and land development activities.\nThe real estate development industry is capital intensive, and development requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land and begin development. Accordingly, we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuilding and land development activities. Although we believe that internally generated funds and current borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our capital and other expenditures (including land acquisition, development and construction activities), the amounts available from such sources may not be adequate to meet our needs. If such sources are not sufficient, we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources, including bank financings and securities offerings. Our ability to secure sufficient financing for land use rights acquisition and property development depends on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including market conditions in the capital markets, investors\u2019 perception of our securities, lenders\u2019 perception of our creditworthiness, the PRC economy and PRC government regulations that affect the availability and cost of financing for real estate companies. Furthermore, the availability of borrowed funds to be utilized for land acquisition or development and construction may decline, and, as a result, the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with new loans and this could render obtaining funds more difficult if not impossible. In turn, the failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including industry and market conditions, our ability to successfully implement new branding and marketing initiatives and expansion of our production capabilities. We anticipate that we may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our business and implement our business strategy. We anticipate that any such additional funds may be raised through equity or debt financings. In addition, we may enter into a revolving credit facility or a term loan facility with one or more syndicates of lenders. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Even if we are able to raise capital through equity or debt financings, as to which there can be no assurance, the interest of existing stockholders in our Company may be diluted, and the securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. See also \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d In addition, we have and will continue to raise additional capital through private placements or registered offerings, in which broker-dealers may be engaged. The activities of such broker-dealers are highly regulated and we cannot assure that the activities of such broker-dealers will not violate relevant regulations and generate liabilities despite our expectations otherwise.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation which could make it difficult for us to obtain adequate funding or additional funding.\nVarious PRC regulations restrict our ability to raise capital through external financings and other methods, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 we cannot pre-sell uncompleted residential units in a project prior to achieving certain development milestones specified in related regulations;\n\u2022 PRC banks are prohibited from extending loans to real estate companies to fund the purchase of land use rights;\n\u2022 we cannot borrow from a PRC bank for a particular project unless we fund at least 35% of the total investment amount of that project using our own capital;\n\u2022 we cannot borrow from a PRC bank for a particular project if we do not obtain the land use right certificate for that project;\n\u2022 property developers are strictly prohibited from using the proceeds from a loan obtained from a local bank to fund property developments outside of the region where the bank is located; and\n\u2022 PRC banks are prohibited from accepting properties that have been vacant for more than three years as collateral for a loan.\nThe PRC government may introduce other measures that limit our access to additional capital. In November 2007, the China Bank Regulatory Commission, or the CBRC, provided policy guidelines to PRC banks and Chinese subsidiaries of foreign banks that loans outstanding at December 31, 2007 should not exceed the level of outstanding loans as of October 31, 2007. This lending freeze may limit our ability to access additional loans or to roll over existing loans as they mature, and may also prevent or delay potential customers\u2019 abilities to secure mortgage loans to purchase residential properties. In addition, on July 10, 2007, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued a circular restricting a foreign invested property developer\u2019s ability to raise capital through foreign debt, if such developer is established after June 1, 2007 or increases its registered capital after June 1, 2007. Under this circular, our ability to utilize the proceeds of this offering to provide funding to our PRC operations is significantly limited. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to finance intended purchases of land use rights, develop future projects or meet other capital needs as and when required at a commercially reasonable cost or at all. Failure to obtain adequate funding at a commercially reasonable cost may limit our ability to commence new projects or to continue the development of existing projects or may increase our borrowing costs.\nWe are subject to the uncertainty of the local government\u2019s regulation and role which may adversely affect our business.\nLocal governments may require the Company to change relevant planning indexes in the lands already acquired or planned to acquire by the Company due to the overall changes of the city planning or newly adopted regulation or policies. It may adversely affect the total amount of available sales area and the selling price of the Company\u2019s projects. In the meantime, our construction company has been the contractor for certain government projects and our real estate subsidiaries also sold certain properties to governments. Consequently, the governments\u2019 cash flow situation and the change in the government\u2019s relevant administrative role may affect the collection and realization of such sales to the governments.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation which may cause us to incur significant liabilities or may restrict our business activities.\nRegulatory requirements could cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses and could restrict our business activities. We are subject to statutes and rules regulating, among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design, and matters concerning the protection of health and the environment. Our operating expenses may be increased by governmental regulations such as building permit allocation ordinances and impacts as well as other fees and taxes, which may be imposed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements. Any delay or refusal from government agencies to grant us necessary licenses, permits and approvals could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may be unable to acquire desired development land sites at commercially reasonable costs.\nOur revenue depends on the completion and sale of our projects, which in turn depend on our ability to acquire development sites. Our land use rights costs are a major component of our cost of real estate sales and increases in such costs could diminish our gross margin. In China, the PRC government controls the supply of land and regulates land sales and transfers in the secondary market. As a result, the policies of the PRC government, including those related to land supply and urban planning, affect our ability to acquire, and our costs of acquiring, land use rights for our projects. In recent years, the government has introduced various measures attempting to limit investment in the property market in China. Although we believe that these measures are generally targeted at the luxury property market and speculative purchases of land and properties, we cannot assure you that the PRC government will not introduce other measures in the future that adversely affect our ability to obtain land for development. We currently acquire some of our development sites through company bankruptcies. Under current regulations, land use rights acquired from government authorities for commercial and residential development purposes must be purchased through a public tender, auction or listing-for-sale. We may not be able to continue to purchase land use rights from companies in bankruptcy and our land use rights costs may increase in the future, which may lead to a decrease in our profit margin. In addition, we may not successfully obtain desired development sites due to the increasingly intense competition in the land acquisition process. Moreover, the supply of potential development sites in any given city will diminish over time and we may find it increasingly difficult to identify and acquire attractive development sites at commercially reasonable costs in the future.\nWe depend on the availability of additional human resources for future growth.\nWe believe that continued expansion is essential for us to remain competitive and to capitalize on the growth potential of our business. Such expansion may place a significant strain on our management and operations and financial resources. As our operations continue to grow, we will have to continually improve our management, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and other resources infrastructure, and expand our workforce. There can be no assurance that our existing or future management, operating and financial systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations, or that we will be able to recruit, retain and motivate our personnel. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish, develop or maintain the business relationships beneficial to our operations, or to do so or to implement any of the above activities in a timely manner. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in raw material prices and selling prices of our products.\nOur projects and the raw materials we use have experienced significant price fluctuations in the past. There is no assurance that they will not be subject to future price fluctuations or pricing controls. The land and raw materials we use may experience price volatility caused by events such as market fluctuations or changes in governmental programs. The market prices of land and raw materials may also experience significant upward adjustment, if, for instance, there is a material under-supply or over-demand in the market. These price changes may ultimately result in increases in the selling prices of our products, and may, in turn, adversely affect our sales volume, revenue and operating profit.\nWe could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters.\nFrom time to time, our development sites may experience strong winds, storms, flooding and earthquakes. Natural disasters could impede operations or damage infrastructure necessary to our construction projects and operations. The occurrence of natural disasters could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations, as well as our prospects and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on third-party subcontractors, manufacturers, and distributors for all construction services and the supply of construction materials, and a discontinued supply of such services and materials could adversely affect our construction projects.\nThe Company is dependent on third-party subcontractors, manufacturers, and distributors for all construction services and the supply of construction materials. Construction services or products purchased from the Company\u2019s five largest subcontractors/suppliers accounted for 33% of the total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2014. A disruption in the supply of such services and materials will adversely affect our construction projects.\nIntense competition from existing and new entities may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIn general, the property development industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with various companies. Many of our competitors are more established than we are and have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we presently possess. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and a larger customer base. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and customer requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We intend to create greater awareness for our brand name so that we can successfully compete with our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively or successfully with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not harm our business.\nOur operating subsidiaries must comply with environmental protection laws and such compliance could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are required to comply with the environmental protection laws and regulations promulgated by the national and local governments of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d or \u201cChina\u201d). Some of these regulations govern the level of fees payable to government entities providing environmental protection services and the prescribed standards relating to the construction projects. Although our construction technologies allow us to efficiently control the level of pollution resulting from our construction processes, due to the nature of our business, waste is unavoidably generated in such processes. If we fail to comply with any of these environmental laws and regulations in the PRC, depending on the type and seriousness of the violation, we may be subject to, among other things, warnings from relevant authorities, the imposition of fines, specific performance and/or criminal liability, forfeiture of profits made, being ordered to close down our business operations and/or suspension of relevant permits.\nOur success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management, including Mr. Pingji Lu, our Chairman. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could impede implementation of our business plan and result in reduced profitability. We do not carry key person life or other insurance for any of our officers or employees. Our future success will also depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical sales and marketing customer support personnel. Because of the rapid growth of the economy in the PRC, competition for qualified personnel is intense. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse litigation results may harm our business and financial conditions.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, a party to litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us, including shareholder litigation. We cannot predict the adverse results in such litigation and other proceedings that may harm our business, financial conditions and reputation.\nThe recognition of our real estate revenue and costs relies upon our estimation of total project sales value and cost.\nWe recognize our real estate revenue based on the percentage of completion method depending on the estimated project construction period. Under this method, revenue and costs are calculated based on an estimation of total project costs and total project revenue, which are revised on a regular basis as the work progresses. Any material deviation between the actual and the estimated total project sales and costs may result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of reported revenues or costs from period to period, and, as a result, such deviations could have an impact on our net income of the fiscal year reported.\nOur failure to assist our customers in applying for property ownership certificates in a timely manner may lead to compensatory liabilities to our customers.\nWe are required to meet various requirements within 90 days after delivery of our properties, or such other period as contracted with our customers, in order for our customers to apply for their property ownership certificates. These requirements include obtaining various governmental clearances, and complying with various formalities and procedures. Under our sales contracts, we are liable for any delay in the submission of the required documents that is a result of our failure to meet such requirements, and, in such cases, we are required to compensate our customers for such delays. In the case of serious delays on one or more property projects, we may be required to pay significant compensation to our customers and our reputation may be adversely affected.\nWe do not have insurance to cover potential losses and claims.\nWe do not have insurance coverage against potential losses or damages with respect to our properties before their delivery to customers, nor do we maintain insurance coverage against liability from tortious acts or other personal injuries on our project sites. Although we require our contractors to carry insurance, we believe most of our contractors do not comply with this requirement. Our contractors may not be sufficiently insured themselves or have the financial ability to absorb any losses that arise with respect to our projects or pay our claims. In addition, there are certain types of losses, such as losses due to earthquakes, which are currently uninsurable in China. We have property insurance that cover the under construction properties and fixed-assets. While we believe that our practice is in line with the general practice in the PRC property development industry, there may be instances when we will have to internalize losses, damages and liabilities because of the lack of insurance coverage, which may in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to obtain, or may experience material delays in obtaining necessary government approvals for any major property development, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe real estate industry is strictly regulated by the PRC government. Property developers in China must abide by various laws and regulations, including rules promulgated by local governments to enforce these laws and regulations. Before commencing, and during the course of, development of a property project, we need to apply for various licenses, permits, certificates and approvals, including land use rights certificates, construction site planning permits, construction work planning permits, construction permits, pre-sale permits and completion acceptance certificates. We need to satisfy various requirements to obtain these certificates and permits. To date, we have not encountered serious delays or difficulties in the process of applying for these certificates and permits, but we cannot ensure that we will not encounter serious delays or difficulties in the future. In the event that we fail to obtain the necessary governmental approvals for any of our major property projects, or a serious delay occurs in the government\u2019s examination and approval progress, we may not be able to maintain our development schedule and our business and cash flows may be adversely affected. We may forfeit land to the PRC government if we fail to comply with procedural requirements applicable to land grants from the government or the terms of the land use rights grant contracts.\nAccording to the relevant PRC regulations, if we fail to develop a property project according to the terms of the land use rights grant contract, including those relating to the payment of land premiums, specified use of the land and the time for commencement and completion of the property development, the PRC government may issue a warning, may impose a penalty or may order us to forfeit the land. Specifically, under current PRC law, if we fail to commence development within one year after the commencement date stipulated in the land use rights grant contract, the relevant PRC land bureau may issue a warning notice to us and impose an idle land fee on the land of up to 20% of the land premium. If we fail to commence development within two years, the land will be subject to forfeiture to the PRC government, unless the delay in development is caused by government actions or force majeure. Even if the commencement of the land development is compliant with the land use rights grant contract, if the developed general floor area on the land is less than one-third of the total general floor area of the project or the total capital invested is less than one-fourth of the total investment of the project and the suspension of the development of the land continues for more than one year without government approval, the land will also be treated as idle land and be subject to penalty or forfeiture. We cannot assure you that circumstances leading to significant delays in our development schedule or forfeiture of land will not arise in the future. If we forfeit land, we will not only lose the opportunity to develop the property projects on such land, but may also lose all past investments in such land, including land premiums paid and development costs incurred.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to comply with these reporting obligations or if we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), including preparing annual reports and quarterly reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner could subject us to penalties under U.S. federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. In addition, we are required under applicable law and regulations to design and implement internal controls over financial reporting, and evaluate our existing internal controls with respect to the standards adopted by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not identify control deficiencies that may constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future. As a result, we may be required to implement further remedial measures and to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through future reviews. This could result in significant delays and costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities.\nIf we do not fully remediate the material weaknesses identified by management or fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in the future, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, any failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nRisk Relating to the Residential Property Industry in China (Since commercial property is not our core business, we mainly focus on the risk relating to residential property.)\nOur global income and the dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiary may be subject to PRC tax under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation rules define the term \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d as \u201cestablishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.\u201d The State Administration of Tax, or SAT, issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. Circular 82 provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the \u201cde facto management body\u201d of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise is located in China. Although Circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises, not those controlled by PRC individuals, like our Company, the determining criteria set forth in Circular 82 may reflect SAT\u2019s general position on how the \u201cde facto management body\u201d test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals. Accordingly, we may be considered a resident enterprise and may therefore be subject to the enterprise income tax at 25% on our global income. If we are considered a resident enterprise and earn income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiary, a 25% enterprise income tax on our global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability.\nUnder the applicable PRC tax laws in effect before January 1, 2008, dividend payments to foreign investors made by foreign-invested enterprises in China and paid to the foreign investors, such as Tsining Housing Development, were exempt from PRC withholding tax. Pursuant to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, however, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and payable by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its foreign investors will be subject to a 10% withholding tax, unless any such foreign investor\u2019s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement.\nThe PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that PRC withholding tax at the rate of 10% will generally be applicable to dividends derived from sources within the PRC and received by non-PRC enterprise shareholders. Similarly, gains derived from the transfer of shares by such shareholders are also subject to PRC enterprise income tax if such gains are regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. We are a U.S. holding company and substantially all of our income may come from dividends we receive from our subsidiaries, primarily those located in China. If the dividends we pay to our stockholders, or the gains our non-PRC stockholders may realize from the transfer of our common shares are to be treated as PRC-sourced income, 10% PRC withholding tax will be imposed.\nIn addition, because there remains uncertainty regarding the interpretation and implementation of the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, it is uncertain whether, if we are regarded as a PRC resident enterprise, any dividends to be distributed by us to our non-PRC stockholders would be subject to any PRC withholding tax. Hence we cannot assure you that such dividends will continue to be exempt from PRC income tax law. If we are required under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our non-PRC corporate stockholders, your investment in our common shares may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company, and we may rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements, which include the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our stockholders and to service any debt we may incur. In the future, if our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their abilities to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries, as foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC, may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. At its discretion, it may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.\nAny limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nThe enforcement of the Labor Contract Law and other labor-related regulations in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nOn June 29, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of China enacted the Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. Compared to the Labor Law, the Labor Contract Law establishes more restrictions and increases costs for employers to dismiss employees, including specific provisions related to fixed-term employment contracts, temporary employment, probation, consultation with the labor union and employee assembly, employment without a contract, dismissal of employees, compensation upon termination and overtime work, and collective bargaining. According to the Labor Contract Law, an employer is obliged to sign a labor contract with an unlimited term with an employee if the employer continues to hire the employee after the expiration of two consecutive fixed-term labor contracts or the employee has worked for the employer for ten consecutive years. The employer also has to pay compensation to an employee if the employer terminates an unlimited-term labor contract. Such compensation is also required when the employer refuses to renew a labor contract that has expired, unless it is the employee who refuses to extend the expired contract. In addition, under the Regulations on Paid Annual Leave for Employees, which became effective on January 1, 2008, employees who have served more than one year for an employer are entitled to a paid vacation ranging from 5 to 15 days, depending on their length of service. Employees who waive such vacation time at the request of employers shall be compensated for three times their regular salaries for each waived vacation day.\nAccording to the above PRC central government and local regulations, we are required to pay to the designated government agencies various statutory employee benefits, including pensions, housing funds, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and childbearing insurance for all employees. At the same time, we are required to pay statutory employee benefits based on the local government pre-set contribution ratio, and accrue provisions for unpaid employee benefits based on relevant central government regulations. Thus, we cannot be certain that such accrued amounts will be sufficient to meet any additional employee benefits payments that we are required to pay in the future. As a result of these new measures designed to enhance labor protection, our employee costs are expected to increase, which may adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nWe are heavily dependent on the performance of the residential property market in China, which is in a relatively early stage of development.\nThe residential property industry in the PRC is still in a relatively early stage of development. Although demand for residential property in the PRC has been growing rapidly in recent years, such growth is often coupled with volatility in market conditions and fluctuation in property prices. It is extremely difficult to predict how much and when demand will develop, as many social, political, economic, legal and other factors, most of which are beyond our control, may affect the development of the market. The level of uncertainty is increased by the limited availability of accurate financial and market information as well as the overall low level of transparency in the PRC, especially in second-tier cities which have lagged in progress in these aspects when compared to first-tier cities.\nThe lack of a liquid secondary market for residential property may discourage investors from acquiring new properties. The limited amount of property mortgage financing available to PRC individuals may further inhibit demand for residential developments.\nWe face intense competition from other real estate developers.\nThe property industry in the PRC is highly competitive. In the second-tier cities in which we operate, local and regional property developers are our major competitors, and an increasing number of large state-owned and private national property developers have started entering these markets. Many of our competitors, especially the state-owned and private national property developers, are well capitalized and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Some also have larger land banks, greater economies of scale, broader name recognition, a longer track record and more established relationships in certain markets. In addition, the PRC government\u2019s recent measures designed to reduce land supply further increased competition for land among property developers.\nCompetition among property developers may result in increased costs for the acquisition of land for development, increased costs for raw materials, shortages of skilled contractors, oversupply of properties, decrease in property prices in certain parts of the PRC, a slowdown in the rate at which new property developments will be approved and/or reviewed by the relevant government authorities and an increase in administrative costs for hiring or retaining qualified personnel, any of which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Furthermore, property developers that are better capitalized than we are may be more competitive in acquiring land through the auction process. If we cannot respond to changes in market conditions as promptly and effectively as our competitors or effectively compete for land acquisition through the auction process or fail to compete on other terms with our competition, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, risk of property over-supply is increasing in parts of China, where property investment, trading and speculation have become overly active. We are exposed to the risk that in the event of actual or perceived over-supply, property prices may fall drastically, and our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe PRC government may adopt further measures to slow the growth of the property sector.\nAlong with the economic growth in China, investments in the property sectors have increased significantly in the past few years. In response to concerns over the scale of the increase in property investments, the PRC government has introduced policies to slow property development. We believe the following regulations, among others, significantly affect the property industry in China.\nIn May 2006, the Ministry of Construction, National Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC, People\u2019s Bank of China (the \u201cPBOC\u201d) and other relevant PRC government authorities jointly issued the Opinions on Adjusting the Housing Supply Structure and Stabilizing the Property Prices, which introduced measures to limit resources allocated to the luxury residential market. For instances, the new measures require that after June 1, 2006 at least 70% of a residential project must consist of units with a Gross Floor Area (\u201cGFA\u201d) of less than 90 square meters per unit, and, if it has a unit GFA of 90 square meters or more and the property is purchased for residence purpose only, the minimum amount of down payment was increased from 20% to 30% of the purchase price of the underlying property. In September 2007, the PBOC and the China Banking Regulatory Commission issued the Circular on Strengthening the Management of Commercial Real Estate Credit Facilities, which increased the minimum down payment for any purchase of second or subsequent residential property to 40% of the purchase price if the purchaser had obtained a bank loan to finance the purchase of his or her first property. In February 2011, the Xi\u2019an local government increased the minimum down payment for a second residential property purchase to 60% of the purchase price and restricted any further purchases.\nIn July 2006, the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Commerce, the NDRC, the PBOC, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the SAFE issued Opinions on Regulating the Entry and Administration of Foreign Investment in Real Property Market, which impose significant requirements on foreign investment in the PRC real estate sector. For instance, these opinions set forth requirements for registered capital of a foreign invested real property enterprise as well as thresholds for a foreign-invested real property enterprise to borrow domestic or overseas loans. In addition, in May 2007, the Ministry of Commerce and SAFE jointly issued the Notice on Further Strengthening and Regulating the Approval and Supervision of Foreign Investment in Real Estate Market, which requires, a foreign-invested real property enterprise approved by local authorities to register such approvals with the Ministry of Commerce.\nAdopting the PRC government\u2019s restrictive regulations and measures to curtail overheating of the property sector could increase our operating costs, limit our access to capital resources or even restrict our business operations. We cannot be certain that the PRC government will not issue additional and more stringent regulations or measures, which could further slow down property development in China and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur sales will be affected if mortgage financing becomes more costly or otherwise becomes less attractive.\nSubstantially all purchasers of our residential properties rely on mortgages to fund their purchases. An increase in interest rates may significantly increase the cost of mortgage financing, thus affecting the affordability of residential properties. In 2008, the PBOC changed the lending rates five times. The benchmark lending rate for loans with a term of over five years, which affects mortgage rates, was increased to 5.94% on August 30, 2010. The PRC government and commercial banks may also increase the down payment requirement, impose other conditions or otherwise change the regulatory framework in a manner that would make mortgage financing unavailable or unattractive to potential property purchasers. Under current PRC laws and regulations, purchasers of residential properties generally must pay at least 20% of the purchase price of the properties before they can finance their purchases through mortgages. In May 2006, the PRC government increased the minimum amount of down payment to 30% of the purchase price of the underlying property if such property has a unit GFA of 90 square meters or more and the property is purchased for residence purpose only. In September 2007, the minimum down payment for any purchase of a second or subsequent residential property was increased to 40% of the purchase price if the purchaser had obtained a bank loan to finance the purchase of his or her first property. Moreover, the interest rate for bank loans of such purchases shall not be less than 110% of the PBOC benchmark rate of the same term and category. In February 2011, the Xi\u2019an local government increased the minimum down payment for a second residential property purchase to 60% of the purchase price and restricted any further purchases. In addition, mortgagee banks may not lend to any individual borrower if the monthly repayment of the anticipated mortgage loan would exceed 50% of the individual borrower\u2019s monthly income or if the total debt service of the individual borrower would exceed 55% of such individual\u2019s monthly income. If the availability or attractiveness of mortgage financing is reduced or limited, many of our prospective customers may not be able to purchase our properties and, as a result, our business, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn line with industry practice, we provide guarantees to PRC banks with respect to loans procured by the purchasers of our properties for the total amount of such mortgage loans. Such guarantees expire upon the completion of the registration of the mortgage with the relevant mortgage registration authorities. If there are changes in laws, regulations, policies, and practices that would prohibit property developers from providing guarantees to banks in respect of mortgages offered to property purchasers and as a result, banks would not accept any alternative guarantees by third parties, or if no third party is available or willing in the market to provide such guarantees, it may become more difficult for property purchasers to obtain mortgages from banks and other financial institutions during sales and pre-sales of our properties. Such difficulties in financing could result in substantially lower rates of sales and pre-sales of our properties, which would adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations. We are not aware of any impending changes in laws, regulations, policies or practices that will prohibit such practices in China. However, there can be no assurance that such changes in laws, regulations, policies or practices will not occur in China in the future.\nThe PRC government from time to time introduces certain policy and regulatory measures to cool down the real estate market and we have seen the effects of such policies and regulatory measures in certain cities.\nSince the second half of 2009, the PRC real estate market has experienced exponential growth and housing prices rose rapidly in certain cities. In response to concerns over the scale of the increase in property investments, the PRC government has implemented measures and introduced policies to slow property development and promote the healthy development of the real estate industry in the PRC.\nIn April 2010, the general office of the PRC State Council issued a circular to all ministries and provincial-level local governments. Among other matters, the circular provided as follows: purchasers of a first residential property for their households with a gross floor area of greater than 90 square meters must make down payments of no less than 30% of the purchase price; purchasers of a second residential property for their households must make down payments of no less than 50% of the purchase price and the interest rate of any mortgage for such property must equal at least the benchmark interest rate plus 10%; and for purchasers of a third residential property, both the minimum down payment amount and applied interest rate must be significantly higher than the relevant minimum down payment and interest rate which would have been applicable prior to the issuance of the circular. In order to implement the requirements set forth in the State Council\u2019s circular, the People\u2019s Bank of China and the Ministry of Land and Resources issued implementing regulatory measures to restrict mortgage lending and tighten the availability of land resources for future constructions.\nIn cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, we have seen the effects of such policies and regulatory measures. The sales volumes for real properties in Beijing and Shanghai decreased significantly after the policy change. The sale prices for certain properties in such cities also weakened. The PRC government\u2019s policy and regulatory measures on the PRC real estate sector could limit our access to required financing and other capital resources, adversely affect the property purchasers\u2019 ability to obtain mortgage financing or significantly increase the cost of mortgage financing, reduce market demand for our properties and increase our operating costs. These factors may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur sales, revenues and operations will be affected if our customers are not able to secure mortgage financing on attractive terms, if at all.\nSubstantially all purchasers of our residential properties rely on mortgages to fund their purchases. If the availability or attractiveness of mortgage financing is reduced or limited, many of our prospective customers may not be able to purchase our properties and, as a result, our business, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCertain circulars issued by the PRC State Council and related measures taken by ministries and local governments have restricted and may continue to restrict the ability of purchasers to qualify for or obtain mortgage financing. For example, under a circular issued in April 2010, certain purchasers of our properties can no longer qualify for loans and this led to cancellations of our existing sales and the returning of down payments by us to those persons who had previously entered into contracts with us to purchase a unit but were unable to obtain a mortgage within the 30-day period after the contract date.\nThe PRC government may issue further restrictive measures in the future.\nWe cannot assure you that the PRC government will not issue further restrictive measures in the future. The PRC government\u2019s restrictive regulations and measures could increase our operating costs in adapting to these regulations and measures, limit our access to capital resources or even restrict our business operations, which could further adversely affect our business and prospects.\nAn increase in interest rates will increase our customers\u2019 mortgage financing, which may further adversely affect the real estate market in the PRC.\nAn increase in interest rates may significantly increase the cost of mortgage financing, thus affecting the affordability of residential properties. According to a circular issued in April 2010, financial institutions must determine the applicable loan interest rate and down-payment ratio for non-welfare residential property according to the following factors: (i) whether the borrower is purchasing a property for the first time; (ii) whether the borrower is purchasing the property for his/her own use; (iii) whether the property purchased is an ordinary residential property; and (iv) risk factors including the borrower\u2019s credit records and payment ability. Increases in mortgage financing costs may dampen people\u2019s desire to purchase residential properties and adversely affect the real estate market in the PRC.\nThe Company\u2019s PRC subsidiaries have taken the position that they are compliant with the taxation, environmental, employment and social security rules of China, and if that position turns out to be wrong, they may face penalties imposed by the PRC government.\nWhile the Company believes its PRC subsidiaries have been in compliance with PRC taxation, environmental, employment and social security rules during their operations in China, the Company has not obtained letters from the PRC government authorities confirming such compliance. If any PRC government authority takes the position that there is non-compliance with the taxation, environmental protection, employment and social security rules by any of the Company\u2019s PRC subsidiaries, they may be exposed to penalties from such PRC government authority, in which case the operation of the Company\u2019s PRC subsidiaries in question may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nChina\u2019s economic policies could affect our business.\nSubstantially all of our assets are located in China and substantially all of our revenue is derived from our operations in China. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects are subject, to a significant extent, to any economic, political or legal developments in China.\nWhile China\u2019s economy has experienced significant growth over the past 20 years, such growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall economy of China, but they may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations.\nThe economy of China has been changing from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. In recent years, the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reforms, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of corporate governance in business enterprises; however, a substantial portion of productive assets in China are still owned by the Chinese government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, the control of payments of foreign currency-denominated obligations, the setting of monetary policy and the provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nCapital outflow policies in China may hamper our ability to remit income to the United States.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive all of our revenue in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, our U.S. holding company may rely on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, our PRC subsidiaries are able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. This could affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financings, including by means of loans or capital contributions from us. In the future, the PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our stockholders.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively.\nThe majority of our revenues and operating expenses are denominated in Renminbi. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, promulgated on January 29, 1996 and amended on January 14, 1997, and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant PRC government authorities, Renminbi is freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investments, require the prior approval from SAFE or its local branch for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency-denominated obligations. Currently, each of our PRC subsidiaries and affiliates may purchase foreign exchange for settlement of \u201ccurrent account transactions,\u201d including payment of dividends to us and payment of license fees and service fees to foreign licensors and service providers, without the approval of SAFE. However, approval from the SAFE or its local branch is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe fluctuation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect your investment.\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions and China\u2019s foreign exchange policies. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, has been based on exchange rates set by the People\u2019s Bank of China. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB solely to the U.S. dollar. Under this revised policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Since the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, the RMB has appreciated more than 30% against the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how long the current situation may last and when and how RMB exchange rates may change going forward. Any significant revaluation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our common stock into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making dividend payments on our common shares or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the value of the U.S. dollar equivalent we could receive on conversion would be reduced. Any significant devaluation of the Renminbi may reduce our operation costs in U.S. dollars but may also reduce our earnings in U.S. dollars. In addition, the depreciation of significant U.S. dollar-denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the value of those assets.\nThere can be no assurance that the Renminbi will not be subject to devaluation. We may not be able to hedge effectively against Renminbi devaluation, so there can be no assurance that future movements in the exchange rate of the Renminbi and other currencies will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain approval for sufficient foreign exchange amounts to pay dividends or satisfy other foreign exchange requirements in the future.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses were denominated primarily in RMB while the common stocks are traded in U.S. dollars. Therefore, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have an impact on our financial conditions. Although in general, our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited, the value of your investment in our common stocks will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments.\nIt may be difficult to effect service of process and enforcement of legal judgments upon our Company and our officers and directors because some of them reside outside the United States.\nAs our operations are presently based in China and our directors and officers reside outside the United States, service of process on our directors and officers may be difficult to effect within the United States. Also, substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States and any judgment obtained in the United States against us may not be enforceable outside the United States. Moreover, our PRC counsel has advised us that the PRC does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments. In order to minimize this risk of non-enforcement, we have appointed Pingji Lu, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as our agent to receive service of process in any action against our Company in the United States.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, our stock price may decrease and we may have difficulty accessing the U.S. capital markets.\nAt various times during recent years, the United States and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade conflicts between the United States and China could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to access U.S. capital markets.\nWe may face obstacles from the communist system in China.\nForeign companies conducting operations in China face significant political, economic and legal risks. The political system in China, which includes a cumbersome bureaucracy, may hinder western investment in the Company.\nWe may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in China.\nChina historically has not adopted a western style of management or financial reporting concepts and practices, modern banking, computing or other control systems. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in China. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, methods of collecting financial data and preparing financial statements and accounting and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet western standards.\nIt will be extremely difficult to establish jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against our officers, directors and assets based in China. Because some of the Company\u2019s executive officers and directors, including the chairman of the Board of Directors, are Chinese citizens, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain jurisdiction over these persons in the event a lawsuit is initiated against us and/or our officers and directors by a stockholder or group of stockholders in the United States. Also, because the majority of our assets are located in China, it would also be extremely difficult to access those assets to satisfy an award entered against the Company in a United States court.\nInterpretation of PRC laws and regulations involves uncertainty.\nOur core business is conducted within China and is governed by PRC laws and regulations. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions can only be used as a reference. Since 1979, the PRC government has promulgated laws and regulations in relation to economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, with a view to developing a comprehensive system of commercial law, including laws relating to property ownership and development. However, due to the fact that these laws and regulations have not been fully developed, and because of the limited volume of published cases and the non-binding nature of prior court decisions, interpretation of PRC laws and regulations involves a degree of uncertainty. Some of these laws may be changed without being immediate publication or may be amended with retroactive effect. Depending on the government agency or how an application or case is presented to such agency, we may receive less favorable interpretations of laws and regulations than our competitors, particularly if a competitor has long been established in the locality of, and has developed a relationship with such agency. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management attention. All of these uncertainties may cause difficulties in the enforcement of our land use rights, entitlements under our permits and other statutory and contractual rights and interests.\nWe may face judicial corruption in the PRC.\nAnother obstacle to foreign investment in the PRC is corruption. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain recourse, if desired, through the PRC\u2019s comparably poorly developed and sometimes corrupt judicial systems.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere is no assurance of an established public trading market for our securities, which may adversely affect the ability of investors in our Company to sell their securities on the public markets.\nAlthough our common stock trades on the NASDAQ, a regular trading market for the securities may not be sustained in the future. Market prices for our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the issuance of new equity securities;\n\u2022 changes in interest rates;\n\u2022 competitive developments, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 change in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022 the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022 investor perceptions of our Company and the real estate industry generally; and\n\u2022 general economic and other national conditions.\nThe limited prior public market and trading market may cause volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cCHLN.\u201d The quotation of our common stock on the NASDAQ does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists, and in recent years such market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies like us. Our common stock is thus subject to volatility. In the absence of an active trading market:\n\u2022 investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;\n\u2022 market visibility for our common stock may be limited; and\n\u2022 a lack of visibility for our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market for our common stock.\nOur principal stockholders, current executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our Company and will be able to exercise significant influence over our Company.\nOur executive officers and directors and principal stockholders together beneficially own 47.46% of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock. These stockholders will be able to influence the composition of our Board of Directors, will retain the voting power to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and will continue to have significant influence over our affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock could be considered to be a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nOur common stock could be considered to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if it meets one or more of the definitions in Rule 3a51-1of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. An equity security will be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d unless it meets one of several possible criteria, including, but not limited to: (i) the stock trades at a price of $5.00 per share or more; (ii) it is traded on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange that has certain specific listing standards, such as the NASDAQ; or (iii) is issued by a company with net tangible assets of at least $2.0 million, if in business more than a continuous three years, or that has average revenues of at least $6.0 million for the past three years. The principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers cannot recommend the stock but must trade in it on an unsolicited basis.\nAs of March 26, 2015, our stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market and has a price of $0.39 per share.\nBroker-dealer requirements may affect trading and liquidity.\nSection 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 15g-2 promulgated there under by the SEC require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account.\nPotential investors in our common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to: (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.\nThe dilutive effect of future issuances of securities may have an adverse impact on a stockholder\u2019s proportionate ownership interest.\nThe existing stockholders do not have preemptive rights in any securities issued in the future. The rights of existing stockholders may be diluted by any such issuance. The issuance of shares of our securities in additional capital raising transactions may dilute, and thereby reduce, each existing stockholder\u2019s proportionate ownership interest in our securities.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, as the future sale of a substantial amount of our restricted stock in the public marketplace could reduce the price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, some of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d), subject to certain limitations. The SEC adopted amendments to Rule 144 which became effective on February 15, 2008. Under these amendments, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least 90 days before the sale.\nPersons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock or warrants for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, under which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either of the following:\n\u2022 1% of the total number of securities of the same class then outstanding; or\n\u2022 the average weekly reported volume of trading of such securities during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale; or\n\u2022 the average weekly reported volume of trading pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan or an effective national market system plan during the four-week period preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.\nProvided, in each case, that we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale.\nSuch sales both by affiliates and by non-affiliates must also comply with the manner of sale, current public information and notice provisions of Rule 144.\nOur securities may be delisted.\nOn December 22, 2014, we received a letter from the Staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ indicating that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been below $1.00 per share, the minimum closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notice does not otherwise impact the Company\u2019s listing on NASDAQ at this time.\nIn accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was granted 180 calendar days, or until June 22, 2015, to regain compliance with the Rule (the \u201cCompliance Period\u201d). To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, during the Compliance Period.\nIf the Company does not regain compliance with the rule by June 22, 2015, NASDAQ will provide written notification to the Company that its common stock may be delisted. However, the Company would qualify for an additional 180 calendar day period from June 22, 2015 to regain compliance, if, at the end of the Compliance Period, the Company meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The NASDAQ Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and provides written notice to NASDAQ of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nThere is no assurance as to the price at which the Company\u2019s common stock will trade. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market may have a negative impact upon the level of trading activity in our common stock and may cause a decrease in the value and an increase in the volatility of our stock price. Failing to stay listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market will also make it more difficult for the Company to raise additional capital and for investors to sell their shares of our common stock. The Company intends to actively monitor the bid price for its common stock during the Compliance Period, and the Company\u2019s board of directors is actively considering its available options to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements, including the possible execution of a reverse stock split.", "PERMNO": 92681, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "CHLN"}
