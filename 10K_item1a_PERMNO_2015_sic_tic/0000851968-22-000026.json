{"cik": "851968", "company": "MOHAWK INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information provided in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. If any of the events described in these risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nThe floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence, income and spending, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nDownturns in the U.S. and global economies, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impact the floor covering industry and the Company\u2019s business. During times of economic uncertainty or decline, end consumers tend to spend less on remodeling their homes, which is how the Company derives a majority of its sales. Likewise, new home construction - and the corresponding need for new flooring materials - tends to slow down during recessionary periods. There may be downturns in the foreseeable future that could cause the industry to deteriorate globally or in the local markets in which the Company operates. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products or force it to lower prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe floor covering industry is highly competitive. The Company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors. Some of the Company\u2019s competition is from companies located outside of the United States, and these competitors may benefit from lower input costs or state subsidies. Also, trade tariffs may impact both the Company and its competitors in different and unpredictable ways. Maintaining the Company\u2019s competitive position may require substantial investments in the Company\u2019s product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the Company\u2019s products, force the Company to lower prices or prevent the Company from raising prices to keep up with inflation. Moreover, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and input costs may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with the Company\u2019s products, which may put pressure on the Company\u2019s pricing. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted the Company\u2019s business, and will likely continue to impact the Company\u2019s business in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact areas where the Company operates and sells its products and services. Mohawk generates sales in approximately 170 countries and maintains manufacturing operations in 18 countries. Due to its large global footprint, Mohawk\u2019s business is sensitive to macroeconomic events in the United States and abroad, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company expects that it will continue to see fluctuating demand across a number of its markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, pent up demand for travel and entertainment may reduce consumer willingness to make investments in the Company\u2019s products as health conditions improve. Also, the Company has experienced and may continue to experience plant closures or slowdowns in productivity resulting from lower demand, health-based concerns, COVID-19-related employee absenteeism, supply disruptions and government-mandated closures.\nDuring economic downturns, including current downturns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic experienced in some of the Company\u2019s markets, demand for the Company\u2019s products may significantly decrease. This reduced demand may lead to lower sales and intensified competitive pressures.\nThe Company experienced certain disruptions to its business and further disruptions may occur that could materially affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain supplies, manufacture its products or deliver inventory in a timely manner. Although the Company believes that it can manage its exposure to these risks, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to do so in the future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the Company\u2019s operations, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak (including the possibility of further surges or variants of concern), the efficacy of the vaccination programs in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, supply chain disruptions, rising inflation, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages, employee illness, quarantine, willingness to return to work, vaccine and/or testing mandates, face-coverings and other safety requirements, or travel and other restrictions, and the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals to contain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as further actions taken to limit the resulting economic impact. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic and the related global reaction could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions and results of operations it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factor\u201d section.\nInternational Risks\nThe Company manufactures, sources and sells many products internationally and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.\nThe Company\u2019s international activities are significant to its manufacturing capacity, revenues and profits; and the Company continues to expand internationally through the construction of new manufacturing operations and investments in existing ones. Currently, the Company\u2019s Flooring ROW Segment has significant operations in Europe, Russia, Brazil, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, and the Company\u2019s Global Ceramic Segment has significant operations in Brazil, Europe, Russia and Mexico. In addition, the Company sources raw materials and finished goods from multiple international locations.\nThe Company\u2019s international sales, supply chain, operations and investments are subject to risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022changes in foreign country regulatory requirements;\n\u2022differing business practices associated with foreign operations;\n\u2022various import/export restrictions and the availability of required import/export licenses;\n\u2022imposition of foreign or domestic tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022differing inflationary or deflationary market pressures, including the recent increase in inflation globally;\n\u2022foreign country tax rules, regulations and other requirements, such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations in tax laws;\n\u2022differing labor laws and changes in those laws;\n\u2022work stoppages and labor shortages, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products;\n\u2022government price controls;\n\u2022extended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable;\n\u2022potential difficulties repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries; and\n\u2022compliance with laws governing international relations, including those U.S. laws that relate to sanctions and corruption.\nThe Company cannot assure investors that it will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing risks effectively in each location where the Company does business, and, therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company operates in emerging markets, including Brazil, eastern Europe, Malaysia, Mexico and Russia, and therefore has exposure to doing business in potentially unstable areas of the world.\nOperations in emerging markets are subject to greater risk than more developed markets, including in some cases significant legal, economic and political risks. Market conditions and the political structures that support them are subject to rapid change in these economies, and the Company may not be able to react quickly enough to protect its assets and business operations. In particular, developing markets in which the Company operates may be characterized by one or more of the following:\n\u2022complex and conflicting laws and regulations, which may be inconsistently or arbitrarily enforced;\n\u2022high incidences of corruption in state regulatory agencies;\n\u2022volatile inflation;\n\u2022widespread poverty and resulting political instability;\n\u2022compliance with laws governing international relations, including U.S. laws that relate to sanctions and corruption;\n\u2022immature legal and banking systems;\n\u2022uncertainty with respect to title to real and personal property;\n\u2022underdeveloped infrastructure;\n\u2022heavy state control of natural resources and energy supplies;\n\u2022state ownership of transportation and supply chain assets;\n\u2022high protective tariffs and inefficient customs processes;\n\u2022high crime rates; and\n\u2022war and/or armed conflict.\nChanges in any one or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of results between the Company\u2019s financial periods.\nThe results of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency for consolidated reporting. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The Company may not be able to manage effectively its currency translation risks, and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and affect comparability of the Company\u2019s results between financial periods.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe Company may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.\nThe Company operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design, product category and technical features. Failure to quickly and effectively respond to changing customer demand or technological developments could have a material adverse effect on the business.\nIn periods of rising costs, the Company may be unable to pass raw materials, labor, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe supply and prices of raw materials, labor, energy and fuel-related costs, including those related to oil and natural gas, are subject to market conditions and are impacted by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), labor shortages, weather conditions, natural disasters, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, inflation and increased demand, among other factors. For example, in fiscal 2021, the price of the natural gas consumed in the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations increased significantly in some markets compared to the prior year period. Although the Company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, labor, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company\u2019s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company\u2019s products. In addition to those experienced in fiscal 2021, there have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the Company\u2019s business has been and may be materially affected.\nThe Company may be unable to obtain raw materials or sourced product on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe principal raw materials used in the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations include triexta, nylon, polypropylene, and polyester resins and fibers, which are used in the Company\u2019s carpet and rug business; clay, talc, feldspar and glazes, including frit (ground glass), zircon and stains, which are used in the Company\u2019s ceramic tile business; wood, paper and resins, which are used in the Company\u2019s wood and laminate flooring business; and glass fiber, plasticizers, and pvc resins, which are used in the Company\u2019s sheet vinyl and luxury vinyl tile business. In addition to raw materials, the Company sources finished goods. For certain raw materials and sourced products, the Company is dependent on one or a small number of suppliers. A material temporary or long-term adverse change in the Company\u2019s relationship with such a supplier, the financial condition of such a supplier or such supplier\u2019s ability to manufacture or deliver such raw materials or sourced products to the Company could lead to an interruption of supply or require the Company to purchase more expensive alternatives. Also, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain raw materials or source products at reasonable costs may be impacted by tariffs, global trade uncertainties and international crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to maintain a number of sources for its raw materials, the Company experienced disruptions in its raw materials supply chain resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. While the Company continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and government restrictions enacted to address the pandemic, the long-term impact on its supply chain is unpredictable. An extended interruption in the supply of sourced products or raw materials used in the Company\u2019s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company makes significant capital investments in its business and such capital investments may not be successful or achieve their intended results.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires significant capital investment to expand capacity to support its growth, introduce new products, enter new markets and improve operating efficiencies. The Company has historically made significant capital investments each year and will continue to make capital investments in future periods, including approximately $800 million of capital investments in 2022. While the Company believes that many of its past capital investments have been successful, there is no guarantee that the return on investment from the Company\u2019s recent or future capital projects will be sufficient to recover the expenses and opportunity costs associated with these projects. Furthermore, a meaningful portion of the Company\u2019s capital investment is based on forecasted growth in its business, which is subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased competition and consumer preferences. If the Company does not accurately forecast its future capital investment needs, the Company could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, either of which would negatively affect its revenues and profitability.\nThe Company may experience certain risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.\nThe Company intends to grow its business through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Growth through acquisitions involves risks, many of which may continue to affect the Company after the acquisition. The Company cannot give assurance that an acquired company will achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that the Company expects. Acquisitions may require the issuance of additional securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which may dilute the ownership interests of existing security holders or impose higher interest costs on the Company. Additional challenges related to the Company\u2019s acquisition strategy include:\n\u2022maintaining executive offices in different locations;\n\u2022manufacturing and selling different types of products through different distribution channels;\n\u2022conducting business from various locations;\n\u2022maintaining different operating systems and software on different computer hardware; and\n\u2022retaining key employees.\nFailure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with the Company\u2019s existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability, or otherwise perform as expected, may result in goodwill or other asset impairments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Finally, acquisition targets may be subject to material liabilities that are not properly identified in due diligence and that are not covered by seller indemnification obligation or third-party insurance. The unknown liabilities of the Company\u2019s acquisition targets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIn addition, the Company has made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which the Company has a minority equity interest and lacks management and operational control. The controlling joint venture partner may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with those of the Company. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner, or the joint venture company, may result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation or adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s investment in the joint venture.\nA failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates or partners for strategic investments and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s business strategy, the Company intends to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of complementary businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although the Company regularly evaluates such opportunities, the Company may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund such strategic transactions, which may slow the Company\u2019s growth and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has been, and in the future may be, subject to costs, liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to increasingly numerous and complex laws, regulations and licensing requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. In addition, new laws and regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad, the compliance of which may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental, or other costs on an ongoing basis.\nIn particular, the Company\u2019s operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of materials and finished product. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. The Company may incur material costs in order to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations. For example, Extended Producer Responsibility laws place a shared responsibility for post-consumer product management on various entities involved in the supply chain, including producers and manufacturers. Expansion of Extended Producer Responsibility legislation in the jurisdictions where the Company operates could impose additional responsibility on the Company in relation to the ultimate treatment or disposal of its products, which could lead to an increase in total costs related to the Company\u2019s products. Also, the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system similar to the system that applies to the Company\u2019s businesses in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. The Company\u2019s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy, especially natural gas. Any such \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system or other limitations imposed on the emission of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could require the Company to increase its capital expenditures, use its cash to acquire emission credits or restructure its manufacturing operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire, pandemics or other unexpected events.\nMany of the Company\u2019s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornados, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other unexpected events. The Company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to its reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on its business.\nThe Company may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings relating to its products, operations and compliance with various laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to a variety of product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters. The Company is also subject to various claims related to its operations and its compliance with various corporate laws and regulations, including a putative securities class action and related matters described in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies. A very large claim or several similar claims asserted by a large class of plaintiffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, if the Company is unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against the Company or settlements relating to these matters. Although the Company has product liability insurance and other types of insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the Company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, the Company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Moreover, adverse publicity arising from claims made against the Company, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products.\nThe long-term performance of the Company\u2019s business relies on its ability to attract, develop and retain talented personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design and operations, including in new international markets into which the Company may enter, is key to the Company\u2019s overall success. The Company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the Company\u2019s competitive position and its operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to maintain its patent licensing revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe profit margins of certain of the Company\u2019s businesses, particularly the Company\u2019s Flooring ROW Segment, depend in part upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain, maintain and license proprietary technology used in the Company\u2019s principal product families. The Company has filed and is continuing to file patents relating to many different aspects of the Company\u2019s products and associated methods and is generating patent license revenues on these diverse patents; however, certain revenue-producing patents have expired or will expire. The failure to develop alternative revenues to replace expired or invalidated patents in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to protect its intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company relies, in part, on the patent, trade secret and trademark laws of the U.S., countries in the European Union and elsewhere, as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the Company\u2019s employees, to protect that technology. The Company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the Company with competitive advantages, that third parties will not challenge these patents, or that the Company\u2019s pending patent applications will be approved.\nFurthermore, despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the Company may be unable to prevent competitors and/or third parties from using the Company\u2019s technology without the Company\u2019s authorization, independently developing technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing around the Company\u2019s patents. The use of the Company\u2019s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed, cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks, as appropriate. The Company cannot guarantee that any of the Company\u2019s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. The failure to obtain trademark registrations in the U.S. and in other countries could limit the Company\u2019s ability to protect its trademarks and impede its marketing efforts in those jurisdictions and could have a material effect on its business.\nThe Company generally requires third parties with access to the Company\u2019s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential. While such measures are intended to protect the Company\u2019s trade secrets, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the Company\u2019s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties. In any of these circumstances, the Company\u2019s competitiveness could be significantly impaired, which would limit the Company\u2019s growth and future revenue.\nThird parties may claim that the Company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could cause the Company to incur significant expenses or prevent the Company from selling its products.\nIn the past, third parties have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the Company\u2019s products infringe their patent rights. The Company cannot be certain that the Company\u2019s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others.\nThe Company might be required to pay substantial damages (including punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees), discontinue the use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses authorizing the use of infringing technology. There can be no assurance that licenses for disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms, if at all. In the event of a successful claim against the Company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology, the Company\u2019s business would be materially and adversely affected.\nInformation Technology Risks\nThe Company relies on information systems in managing the Company\u2019s operations and any system failure or deficiency of such systems may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses rely on sophisticated software applications to obtain, process, analyze and manage data. The Company relies on these systems to, among other things:\n\u2022facilitate the purchase, management, distribution, and payment for inventory items;\n\u2022manage and monitor the daily operations of the Company\u2019s distribution network;\n\u2022receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022manage accurate billing to and collections from customers;\n\u2022control logistics and quality control for the Company\u2019s retail operations;\n\u2022manage financial reporting; and\n\u2022monitor point of sale activity.\nThe Company also relies on its computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to the Company\u2019s sales and distribution systems, and certain of the Company\u2019s production processes are managed and conducted by computer.\nAny event that causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time could disrupt the Company\u2019s normal operations. There can be no assurance that the Company can effectively carry out its disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of its information systems, or that the Company will be able to restore its operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to its business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction, harm to the Company\u2019s reputation and loss or misappropriation of sensitive information, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe Company is subject to cybersecurity risks and expects to incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nThe Company\u2019s business employs systems that allow for the secure storage and transmission of customers\u2019, consumers\u2019, vendors\u2019, employees\u2019 and its own sensitive and proprietary information. These systems may be subject to computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, catastrophes, unforeseen events or other cyber-attacks. Any significant compromise or breach of the Company\u2019s data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, consumer, employee, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. Furthermore, as cyber-attacks become more sophisticated, the Company expects to incur increasing costs to strengthen its systems from outside intrusions and to maintain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks. While the Company has implemented administrative and technical controls and has taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect its information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent, or respond to, physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to the Company\u2019s systems.\nIn addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to the Company\u2019s business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs to the Company. Any failure to comply with federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by government entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include significant legal liability.\nFurthermore, third party business partners provide a number of the key components necessary to the Company\u2019s business functions and systems. Any problems caused by these business partners, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a business partner, cyber-attacks and security breaches, regulatory restrictions, fines, or orders or other regulatory action causing reputational harm, failure of a business partner to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business. In addition, the Company\u2019s business partners could also be sources of operational and information security risk to the Company, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party business partners could also create significant delay and expense.\nFinancial and Liquidity Risks\nChanges in the global economy could affect the Company\u2019s overall availability and cost of credit.\nA downturn in the U.S. or global economies could impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness.\nFurther, negative economic conditions may factor into the Company\u2019s periodic credit ratings assessment by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d), Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services, LLC (\u201cS&P\u201d) and Fitch, Inc. Any future changes in the credit rating agencies\u2019 methodology in assessing the Company\u2019s credit strength and any downgrades in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could increase the cost of its existing credit and could adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future. The Company can provide no assurances that downgrades will not occur. The cost and availability of credit during uncertain economic times could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nIf the Company were unable to meet certain covenants contained in its existing credit facilities, it may be required to repay borrowings under the credit facilities prior to their maturity and may lose access to the credit facilities for additional borrowings that may be necessary to fund its operations and growth strategy.\nOn October 18, 2019, the Company entered into a $1,800 million, senior revolving credit facility (the \u201cSenior Credit Facility\u201d) that provides for revolving credit, including limited amounts of credit in the form of letters of credit and swingline loans. Any outstanding borrowings under the Company\u2019s U.S. and European commercial paper programs also reduce availability under the Senior Credit Facility. Including commercial paper borrowings, the Company has utilized approximately $615.3 million under the Senior Credit Facility resulting in a total of $1,184.7 million available as of December 31, 2021.\nIf the Company\u2019s cash flow is worse than expected, the Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness through a public and/or private debt offering or a new bank facility and may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to it, or at all. If the Company is unable to access debt markets at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts due to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or weakness in the Company\u2019s businesses, the Company\u2019s ability to finance its operations or repay existing debt obligations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s credit facilities include certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company\u2019s financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Senior Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than 4.75 to 1.0 through December 31, 2021 and 3.75 to 1.0 after December 31, 2021. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in the Company\u2019s current or future credit facilities or indentures relating to its outstanding public debt could result in an event of default or an acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. The Company cannot be certain that it would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.\nDeclines in the Company\u2019s business conditions may result in an impairment of the Company\u2019s assets which could result in a material non-cash charge.\nA significant or prolonged decrease in the Company\u2019s market capitalization, including a decline in stock price, or a negative long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of its assets which results when the carrying value of the Company\u2019s assets exceed their fair value.\nNegative tax consequences could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the Company\u2019s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In calculating the provision for income taxes, the Company must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. The Company\u2019s domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of profit before tax among these many jurisdictions. However, the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes also includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Company\u2019s future results of operations and tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and ongoing assessments of the Company\u2019s tax exposures.\nForward-Looking Information\nCertain of the statements in this Form 10-K, particularly those anticipating future performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies, and similar matters, and those that include the words \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cexpects\u201d and \u201cestimates\u201d or similar expressions constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
