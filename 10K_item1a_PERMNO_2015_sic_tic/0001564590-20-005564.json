{"cik": "1517228", "company": "CommScope Holding Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to us or our business.\nARRIS Acquisition (the Acquisition) Risks\nThe integration of CommScope and ARRIS International plc (ARRIS) will be costly and time-consuming and the anticipated benefits and cost savings may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. If we are unable to integrate ARRIS effectively, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition.\nWe are on track to deliver at least $75.0 million in cost synergies in the first year post close and we expect to exceed our target annual run-rate savings of $150.0 million ahead of the third anniversary of the close of the ARRIS transaction. We have incurred significant integration and restructuring costs and expect to incur more to achieve these synergies. These synergies are expected to come from all areas of our company, including sales, marketing, general and administrative, operations and R&D. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits is dependent, to a large extent, on our ability to complete the integration of the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate CommScope and ARRIS, or if such integration is successfully accomplished, that such integration will not be more costly or take longer than presently contemplated. If we cannot successfully complete the integration within a reasonable time frame, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe completion of an effective integration of operations, controls, policies and procedures, and technologies, as well as the harmonization of differences in the business cultures of CommScope and ARRIS;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention from ongoing operation of our business as well as ARRIS\u2019 business during the integration;\n\u2022\nour ability to preserve customer, supplier and other important relationships of CommScope and ARRIS and resolve potential conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022\nthe risk that ARRIS may have liabilities we failed to or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence;\n\u2022\nintegrating CommScope\u2019s and ARRIS\u2019 various information systems, including different enterprise resource planning systems, will be complex and costly and may result in production disruptions or other operational challenges;\n\u2022\nthe risk that integrating ARRIS\u2019 workforce into the CommScope workforce may result in disruptions or be more costly than anticipated;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; and\n\u2022\ngreater than expected difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined business.\nAs a result of the Acquisition, The Carlyle Group (Carlyle) owns a substantial portion of our equity and its interests may not be aligned with yours.\nFunding for the Acquisition included an investment by Carlyle in our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result, Carlyle owns approximately 16% of our common stock on an if-converted basis and we have increased the size of our board of directors to eleven, giving Carlyle the right to designate up to two directors. In addition, certain of our existing directors are senior advisors to Carlyle. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of Carlyle could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. For example, the existence of Carlyle as a significant stockholder and Carlyle\u2019s board appointment rights may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company.\nCompetitive Risks\nOur business is dependent on capital spending for data, communication and entertainment networks, and reductions in such capital spending could adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is dependent on capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading data, communication and entertainment networks, which can be volatile and difficult to forecast. Capital spending in the communications industry is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the timing and amount of capital spending in the communications industry, including:\n\u2022\ncompeting technologies;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nseasonality of outside deployments;\n\u2022\ntiming and adoption of the global rollout of new technologies;\n\u2022\ncustomer-specific financial conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer preferences or requirements;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of capital;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation;\n\u2022\ndemand for network services;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures, including pricing pressures;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of new services offered;\n\u2022\nindustry consolidation; and\n\u2022\nreal or perceived trends or uncertainties in these factors.\nAs a result of these factors, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales in the future, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our business is derived from a limited number of key customers and channel partners.\nOur customer base includes direct customers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and channel partners, which include distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers and manufacturers\u2019 representatives. For the year ended December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the Acquisition as if it happened on January 1, 2019, we would have derived approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales from our top two direct customers. Our largest customer would have been Comcast, accounting for approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales, after giving effect to the Acquisition. The concentration of our net sales with these key customers subjects us to a variety of risks including:\n\u2022\nlower sales that could result from the loss of one or more of our key customers;\n\u2022\nless efficient operations that could result in higher costs from an inability to accurately forecast and plan for volatile spending patterns of key customers;\n\u2022\nrenegotiations of agreements with key customers (or consolidation of agreements with common customers in connection with the Acquisition) that could result in materially less favorable terms;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties experienced by one or more of our key customers that could result in reduced purchases of our products and/or delays or difficulties in collecting accounts receivable balances;\n\u2022\nelection by our key customers to purchase products from our competitors in order to diversify their supplier base and dual-source key products, resulting in reduced purchases of our products;\n\u2022\nbeing dependent on customers with substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual obligations, resulting in lower net sales and gross profit; and\n\u2022\nreductions in inventory levels held by channel partners and OEMs, which may be unrelated to purchasing trends by end customers.\nWe are also exposed to similar risks to the extent that we have significant indirect sales to one or more end-users of our products, who may also be a direct customer.\nWe generally have no minimum purchase commitments with any of our distributors, value-added resellers, operators or OEMs or other customers, and our contracts with these parties generally do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Although we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced variability in the level of purchases by our key customers. Any significant reduction in sales to these customers, including as a result of the inability or unwillingness of these customers to continue purchasing our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face competitive pressures with respect to all our major product groups.\nCompetition in our industry depends on a number of factors, including: innovative product and service solution offerings; the ability to adapt to changing markets and customer preferences; product and service quality; timing of the introduction of new products and services; speed of delivery; pricing; and customer service, including the total customer experience.\nIn each of our major product groups, we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies, some of which have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources or lower operating costs. They may also have broader product offerings and market focus. This gives many of these enterprises a competitive advantage to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets over the long term. In some instances, our customers themselves may also be our competition in other business areas. Some of our customers may develop their own software requiring support within our products and/or may design and develop products of their own that are produced to their own specifications directly by a contract manufacturer. Further, our industry continues to consolidate, and the combination of any of our competitors could further increase these advantages and result in competitors with broader market presence.\nSome competitors may be able to bundle their products and services together and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions that better meet customer preferences than we are able to provide, which may cause us to lose sales opportunities and revenue. Competitors\u2019 actions, such as price reductions, acceptance of high-risk contractual terms or the introduction of new, innovative products and services, and the use of exclusively price-driven auctions by customers have caused lost sales opportunities in the past and may cause us to lose sales opportunities in the future. The rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors against whom we may not be able to compete successfully. For example, as networks become more virtualized, the functionality of our products is at risk of being subsumed by competitors who utilize software to provide the same functions as our products. A related trend that could affect us is the emerging interest in distributed access architectures (DAA), which disaggregates some of the functions of the converged cable access platform (CCAP) and the access and transport platforms to enable deployment of these functions in ways that could reduce traditional operator capital expenditures in hybrid fiber-coaxial. Similarly, as there is technology evolution or transformation within the industry, be it DOCSIS 4.0 or PON, there is risk that our market position would be weakened. We have developed and deployed a line of DAA products, but some operators may not be aligned on the specific implementations of DAA and we could lose market share to competitors. Service providers also have the goal of virtualizing CCAP management and control functions as they deploy DAA, and although we are developing a fully virtualized CCAP product, this could potentially enable new competitors to enter the market and reduce operator dependence on our products. If any of our competitors\u2019 products or technologies were to become the industry standard, our business would be negatively affected.\nFurther, if we are unable to transform our business processes to support changing customer expectations and deliver a superior total customer experience, we may lose sales opportunities in the future.\nChanges in trade policies could also decrease the price competitiveness of our products and/or increase our operating costs. For a more complete discussion of our risks related to trade policies, see the risk factor \u201cAdditional tariffs or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products\u201d under \u201cInternational Risks\u201d in this Item 1A. Risk Factors section.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. If we are unable to compete in any of our markets at the same level as we have in the past or are forced to reduce the prices of our products in order to continue to be competitive, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings after the sale, and our failure to offer high-quality support and services after the sale would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nAfter our products are deployed, our channel partners and end customers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our products. A high level of support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our products. In many cases, our channel partners provide support directly to our end-customers. We do not have complete control over the level or quality of support provided by our channel partners. These channel partners may also provide support for other third-party products, which may potentially distract resources from support for our products. If we and our channel partners do not effectively assist our end customers in deploying our products quickly resolving post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support, it would adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers. In some cases, we guarantee a certain level of performance to our channel partners and end customers, which could prove to be resource-intensive and expensive for us to fulfill if unforeseen technical problems arise.\nMany of our service provider and large enterprise end customers have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than our smaller end customers. If our support organization fails to meet the requirements of our service provider or large enterprise end customers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our sales to large end customers. In addition, given the extent of our international operations, our support organization faces challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. As a result of these factors, our failure to maintain high-quality support and services would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges to the regulatory environment in which our customers operate and changes in or uncertainty about government funded programs may negatively impact our business.\nThe telecommunications and cable television industries are subject to significant and changing federal and state regulation, both in the U.S. and other countries. Many of our customers are subject to various rules and regulations as Internet service providers and changes to such rules and regulations could adversely impact our customers\u2019 decisions regarding capital spending. Some of our customers include agencies of the U.S. federal government as well as educational institutions that receive funding from the U.S. federal government. We, as well as some of our customers, also participate in and benefit from government funded programs that encourage the development of network infrastructures. Examples include FirstNet, which is an independent authority within the U.S. Department of Commerce developing, building and operating the nationwide broadband network that equips first responders, and the E-rates program, which provides supplemental funding to school districts to fund upgrades to technical infrastructure, including Wi-Fi infrastructure. Changes in government programs in our industry or uncertainty regarding future changes could adversely impact our customers\u2019 decisions regarding capital spending, which could decrease demand for our products. Decreased demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nOur future success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and customer preferences and develop, implement and market innovative solutions.\nMany of our markets are characterized by rapid advances in information processing and communications capabilities that require increased transmission speeds and density and greater bandwidth. These advances require significant investments in R&D in order to improve the capabilities of our products and services and develop new offerings or solutions that will meet the needs and preferences of our customers. There can be no assurance that our investments in R&D will yield marketable product or service innovations.\nWe may not be successful in our ongoing innovation efforts if, among other things, our products and services are not cost effective, brought to market in a timely manner, compliant with evolving industry standards, accepted in the market or recognized as meeting customer requirements. We could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if we are not successful in our ongoing innovation efforts.\nAs our products become more complex and customer preferences continue to change, we may encounter difficulties in meeting customer preferences, including performance, service and delivery expectations. Developing our products is expensive, complex and involves uncertainties. Each phase in the development of our products presents serious risks of failure, rework or delay, any one of which could impact the timing and cost-effective development of such product and could jeopardize end customer acceptance of the product. We have experienced in the past, and may in the future experience, design, manufacturing, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements. Any such difficulties or delays could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we do not stay current with product life cycle developments, our business may suffer.\nTo compete successfully, we must continue to innovate in anticipation of both our customers\u2019 needs and developing industry trends, which require us to quickly design, develop, manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability. The introduction of new or enhanced products requires that we carefully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering practices and ensure that new products can be timely delivered to meet our customers\u2019 demand.\nFor example, a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on the commercial deployment of technologies based on 4G wireless communications equipment and products. If we are not able to support our customers in an effective and cost-efficient manner as they advance from older generation networks or as they expand the capacity of their networks, our business will suffer. If we do not have competitively priced, market-accepted products available to meet our customers\u2019 planned roll-out of 5G wireless communications systems, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, there are several major trends that we expect to continue to impact the enterprise market and product life cycles. Enterprises are shifting toward mobility indoors and adjusting in-building cabling designs to support Wi-Fi, more access points and in-building cellular applications. Due to significant increases in data traffic and migrations of applications to the cloud, enterprises are also shifting spending toward multi-tenant data centers and hyperscale cloud service providers, which offer cloud data centers services as a replacement to in-house corporate data centers. As a result, there is growing demand for fiber solutions and decelerating demand for copper solutions. If we are unable to continue to support customers in these transitions, or if sales of copper products decline faster than expected, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn order to stay current with product life cycle developments, we have formed strategic relationships with leading technology companies to provide us with early access to technology that we believe will help keep us at the forefront of our industry. Our strategic alliances are generally based on business relationships that have not been the subject of written agreements expressly providing for the alliance to continue for a significant period of time, and the loss of any such strategic relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf our products do not effectively interoperate with cellular networks and mobile devices, future sales of our products could be negatively affected.\nMany of our products are designed to interoperate with cellular networks and mobile devices using Wi-Fi technology. These networks and devices have varied and complex specifications. As a result, we must ensure that our products interoperate effectively with these existing and planned networks and devices. To meet these requirements, we must continue development and testing efforts that require significant capital and employee resources. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or cost-effectively, or at all. If our products do not interoperate effectively, orders for our products could be delayed or cancelled, which would harm our revenue, operating results and reputation, potentially resulting in the loss of existing and potential end customers. The failure of our products to interoperate effectively with cellular networks or mobile devices may result in significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. In addition, our end customers may require our products to comply with new and rapidly evolving security or other certifications and standards. If our products are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, such end customers may not purchase our products, which would harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf our service offerings or products, including material purchased from our suppliers, have quality or performance issues, our business may suffer.\nOur business depends on delivering products and services of consistently high quality. Many of our solutions are highly complex, and testing procedures used by us and our customers are limited to evaluating them under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. Many of our products include both hardware and software components. It is not unusual for software, especially in earlier versions, to contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. For various reasons, once deployed, our products may fail to perform as expected. Performance issues could result from faulty design, defective raw materials or components purchased from suppliers, problems in manufacturing or installation errors. We have experienced such performance issues in the past and remain exposed to such performance issues in the future. In some cases, recall of some or all affected products, product redesigns or additional capital expenditures may be required to correct a defect; and depending on the number of products affected, the cost of fixing or replacing such products could have a material impact on our operating results.\nIn some cases, we are dependent on a sole supplier for components used in our products. Defects in sole-sourced components subject us to additional risk of being able to quickly address any product issues or failures experienced by our customers as a result of the component defect and could delay our ability to deliver new products until the defective components are corrected or a new supplier is identified and qualified. This could increase our costs in resolving the product issue, result in decreased sales of the impacted product or damage our reputation with customers, any of which could negatively impact our operating results.\nHardware or software defects could also permit unauthorized users to gain access to our customers\u2019 networks and/or a consumer\u2019s home network. In addition to potentially damaging our reputation with customers, such defects may also subject us to claims for damages under agreements with our customers and fines by regulatory authorities.\nWe offer warranties on most products, the terms and conditions of which depend upon the product subject to the warranty. In many cases, we also indemnify our customers against damages or losses that might arise from certain claims relating to our products and services. Future claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any significant or systemic product or service failure could also result in lost future sales as a result of reputational damage.\nAlthough certain technical problems experienced by users may not be caused by our products, our business and reputation may be harmed if users perceive our products as the cause of a slow or unreliable network connection, or a high-profile network failure.\nOur products have been deployed in many different locations and user environments and are capable of providing services and connectivity to many different types of devices operating a variety of applications. The ability of our products to operate effectively can be negatively impacted by many different elements unrelated to our products. For example, a user\u2019s experience may suffer from an incorrect setting in a Wi-Fi device. Although certain technical problems experienced by users may not be caused by our products, users often may perceive them to be the underlying cause of poor performance of the wireless network. This perception, even if incorrect, could harm our business and reputation. Similarly, a high-profile network failure may be caused by improper operation of the network or failure of a network component that we did not supply, but service providers may perceive that our products were implicated, which, even if incorrect, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on cloud computing infrastructure operated by third-parties and any disruption in these operations could adversely affect our business.\nFor certain of our service offerings, in particular our Wi-Fi-related cloud services, we rely on third parties to provide cloud computing infrastructure that offers storage capabilities, data processing and other services. We currently operate our cloud-dependent services using Amazon Web Service (AWS) or Google Compute Engine (GCE). We cannot easily switch our AWS or GCE operations to another cloud provider. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these cloud services would impact our operations and our business could be adversely impacted.\nProblems faced by our third-party cloud services with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our end customers. If AWS and GCE are unable to keep up with our needs for capacity, this could have an adverse effect on our business. Any changes in third-party cloud services or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our cloud-based applications, could adversely affect our reputation and may damage our end customers\u2019 stored files or result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Interruptions in our services might adversely affect our reputation and operating results, cause us to issue refunds or service credits, subject us to potential liabilities or result in contract terminations.\nOur business depends on effective management information systems.\nWe rely on effective management information systems for critical business operations, to support strategic business decisions and to maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace. We rely on our enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to support critical business operations such as processing sales orders and invoicing, manufacturing, shipping, inventory control, purchasing and supply chain management, human resources and financial reporting. We expect to begin the upgrade of our ERP software to a newer, cloud-based version in 2020. We may experience difficulties as we transition to the upgraded systems, including loss or corruption of data, delayed shipments, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, unanticipated expenses (including increased costs of implementation or costs of conducting business) and lost revenue. Difficulties in implementing the upgrade or significant system failure could disrupt our operations, divert management\u2019s attention and have an adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe also rely on management information systems to produce information for business decision-making and planning and to support e-commerce activities. Failure to maintain an adequate digital platform or to make additional investment in our digital platform to support e-commerce activities and improve our customer experience could have a material adverse impact on our business through lost sales opportunities.\nIf we are unable to maintain our management information systems, including our IT infrastructure, to support critical business operations, produce information for business decision-making activities and support e-commerce activities, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business or an inability to timely and accurately report our financial results.\nCyber-security incidents, including data security breaches, ransomware or computer viruses, could harm our business by exposing us to various liabilities, disrupting our delivery of products and services and damaging our reputation.\nWe rely extensively on our management information technology systems and those of third parties to operate our business and store proprietary information about our products and intellectual property. Additionally, we and others acting on our behalf receive, process, store and transmit confidential data, including \u201cpersonally identifiable information,\u201d with respect to employees, vendors, customers and others. As the recent rise in cybersecurity incidents around the world indicates, all management information technology systems are vulnerable. Despite the security controls we have in place, our facilities, systems and procedures, and those of our third-party service providers, are at risk of security breaches, acts of vandalism, ransomware, software viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. In particular, unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft or improper disclosure of proprietary, confidential or sensitive information, the deletion or modification of records or interruptions in our operations. These cybersecurity risks increase when we transmit information from one location to another, including transmissions over the Internet or other electronic networks. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of employee, vendor, customer, or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. We employ a variety of security breach countermeasures and security controls designed to mitigate these risks, but we cannot guarantee that all breach attempts can be successfully thwarted by these measures as the sophistication of attacks increases. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to mitigate new and emerging threats while continuing to enhance our information security capabilities or to investigate and remediate security vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, defects in some of the hardware or software we develop and sell, or in their implementation by our customers, could also result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 and/or consumers\u2019 networks. Any such events could result in theft of trade secrets and intellectual property; give rise to legal proceedings; cause us to incur increased costs for insurance premiums, security, remediation and regulatory compliance; subject us to civil and criminal penalties; expose us to liabilities to our customers, employees, vendors, governmental authorities or other third parties; allow others to unfairly compete with us; disrupt our delivery of products and services; expose the confidential information of our clients and others; and have a negative impact on our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause of the nature of information that may pass through or be stored on our solutions or networks, we and our end customers may be subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters.\nGlobally, there has been an increase in laws and regulatory action relating to privacy-related matters. Some of these laws impose requirements for the handling of personal data, including data of employees, consumers and business contacts. Several U.S. states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security of personal information that they collect from consumers over the Internet, and more states may adopt similar legislation. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act on January 1, 2020, which subjects us to stricter obligations, greater fines and more private causes of action related to data security. Also, many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security incident, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract or retain customers, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nForeign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the U.S. For example, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens\u2019 data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. Compliance with GDPR has required changes to products and service offerings, internal and external software systems, including our websites, and changes to many company processes and policies. Failure to comply with GDPR could cause significant penalties and loss of business.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data. For example, Brazil and India have each adopted such laws that became effective in January 2020. These new and proposed laws could increase the cost and complexity of offering our solutions or maintaining our business operations in those jurisdictions. The introduction of new solutions or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations. Our channel partners and end customers also may be subject to such laws and regulations in the use of our products and services.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which often can be enforced by private parties or government entities, are constantly evolving. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be contradictory with each other. For example, a government entity in one jurisdiction may demand the transfer of information forbidden from transfer by a government entity in another jurisdiction. If our actions were determined to be in violation of any of these disparate laws and regulations, in addition to the possibility of fines, we could be ordered to change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and financial condition. There is also a risk that we, directly or as the result of a third-party service provider we use, could be found to have failed to comply with the laws or regulations applicable in a jurisdiction regarding the collection, handling, transfer, disposal or consent to the use of personal data, which could subject us to fines or other sanctions, as well as adverse reputational impact.\nCompliance with these existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly and require significant management time and attention, and failure to comply can result in negative publicity and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices. Customers may demand or request additional functionality in our products or services that they believe are necessary or appropriate to comply with such laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur significant additional costs and can delay or impede the development of new solutions. In addition, there is a risk that failures in systems designed to protect private, personal or proprietary data held by us or our customers using our solutions will allow such data to be disclosed to or seen by others, resulting in application of regulatory penalties, enforcement actions, remediation obligations, private litigation by parties whose data were improperly disclosed or claims from our customers for costs or damages they incur. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIf our integrated global manufacturing operations suffer production or shipping delays, we may have difficulty meeting customer demands.\nDisruption of our ability to produce at or distribute from our manufacturing or contract manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture products at our other manufacturing or contract manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective and timely manner. In particular, some of our manufacturing and contract manufacturing facilities rely on aging production equipment and information technology infrastructure, and if we fail or our contract manufacturers fail to properly maintain or update this equipment, it could affect our ability to manufacture or ship products. Other disruptions, including labor disturbances, fire, electrical outage, natural disaster, pandemics, acts of violence or terrorism, shipping interruptions or some other catastrophic event could adversely affect our ability to manufacture products at our other manufacturing or contract manufacturer facilities in a cost-effective and timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe continued industry move to open standards may impact our future results.\nOur industry has and will continue to demand products based on open standards. The move toward open standards is expected to increase the number of providers that will offer services to the market. This trend is also expected to increase the number of competitors who are able to supply products to service providers and the enterprise market. These factors may adversely impact our future revenues and margins. In addition, many of our customers participate in \u201ctechnology pools\u201d and increasingly request that we donate a portion of our source code used by customers to these pools, which may impact our ability to recapture the R&D investment made in developing such code.\nWe believe that we will be increasingly required to work with third-party technology providers. As a result, we expect the shift to more open standards may require us to license software and other components indirectly to third parties via various open-source or royalty-free licenses. In some circumstances, our use of such open-source technology may include technology or protocols developed by standards settings bodies, other industry forums or third-party companies. The terms of the open-source licenses granted by such parties, or the granting of royalty-free licenses, may limit our ability to commercialize products that utilize such technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWhile we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on U.S., China and other major regions\u2019 critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and/or the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. CommScope aligns with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard and makes use of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) platform, which is committed to aligning with the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations to accurately assess, take potential proactive action and report as appropriate. For additional information, see our Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability pages on the CommScope website: https://www.commscope.com/About-Us/Corporate-Responsibility-and-Sustainability.\nSupply Chain Risks\nOur dependence on commodities subjects us to cost volatility and potential availability constraints.\nOur profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price and availability of certain raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. The principal raw materials and components we purchase are made of metals such as copper, steel, aluminum or brass, plastics and other polymers and optical fiber. Fabricated copper, steel and aluminum are used in the production of coaxial and twisted pair cables, and polymers are used to insulate and protect cables. Prices for copper, steel, aluminum, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have experienced significant volatility as a result of changes in the levels of global demand, supply disruptions and other factors. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. Delays in implementing price increases or a failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases has in the past, and could in the future, have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In an environment of falling commodities prices, we may be unable to sell higher-cost inventory before implementing price decreases, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for certain raw materials and components.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for certain of our raw material and component purchases, including certain memory and chip capacitors, polymers, copper rod, copper and aluminum tapes, fine aluminum wire, steel wire, optical fiber, circuit boards and other electronic components, subassemblies and modules. Certain of our suppliers are sole source suppliers and a number of our agreements with suppliers are short-term in nature.\nOur reliance on sole or limited suppliers, particularly foreign suppliers, and our reliance on subcontractors involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required materials, components and other products, and reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. Current limited supply of components in the memory and passives categories could impact our ability to deliver on a timely basis and increase overall product costs. Our key suppliers have experienced in the past, and could experience in the future, production, operational or financial difficulties, or there may be global shortages of certain raw materials or components we use. Our inability to find sufficient sources of supply on reasonable terms could impact our ability to manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and results of operations. It could also affect our ability to ship products on a timely basis, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also source many of our components from international markets. Any changes in the laws and policies of the U.S. or other countries affecting trade is a risk to us. To the extent there are unfavorable changes imposed by the U.S. or other countries and/or retaliatory actions taken by trading partners, such as the addition of new tariffs or trade restrictions, we may experience material adverse impacts on earnings. For a more complete discussion of our risks related to tariffs and trade restrictions, see the risk factor, \u201cAdditional tariffs or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products\u201d under our \u201cInternational Risk Factors\u201d in this Item 1A. Risk Factors section.\nCapacity constraints with respect to our internal facilities and/or existing or new contract manufacturers could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe internally produce, both domestically and internationally, a portion of the components used in our finished products. We also rely on third-party contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. If we do not have sufficient production capacity, either through our internal facilities or independent contract manufacturers, or if we cannot ramp up capacity for complex products fast enough to meet customer demand, we may experience lost sales opportunities, lost market share and customer relations problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our contract manufacturers encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties we may experience difficulty in meeting customer demands.\nWe rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. Our reliance on these contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs and product supply and timing. Any manufacturing disruption by these contract manufacturers could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders. Our reliance on outsourced manufacturers also increases the potential for infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. If we are unable to manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers effectively, or if our contract manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions for any reason, including financial instability, labor disturbances or geopolitical instability, experience increased manufacturing lead-times, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship products to our customers may be impaired, and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nThese manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders. In most cases, we do not have long-term contracts with our contract manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits. Accordingly, our contract manufacturers are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements, which could result in supply shortages, and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. In addition, as a result of fluctuating global financial market conditions, natural disasters or other causes, it is possible that any of our manufacturers could experience interruptions in production, cease operations or alter our current arrangements. If our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes, we will be required to identify one or more acceptable alternative manufacturers.\nAdditionally, with the current U.S. trade tariff environment, we are transitioning manufacturing for certain impacted products to non-tariff countries. It is time-consuming and costly, and changes in our contract manufacturers or manufacturing locations may cause significant interruptions in supply if the manufacturers have difficulty manufacturing products to our specifications. As a result, our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales to existing or potential customers, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs.\nProduction interruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic, capacity shortages or quality problems, at one of our manufacturers would negatively affect sales of our products that are manufactured by that manufacturer or utilize components produced by that manufacturer. Such difficulties could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nStrategic Risks\nOur business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to create growth. We may not fully realize anticipated benefits from past or future acquisitions or investments in other companies.\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with the recent acquisition of ARRIS, see the \u201cARRIS Acquisition Risks\u201d noted above under this Item 1A. Risk Factors section.\nBoth CommScope and ARRIS have completed a number of significant acquisitions and invested in other companies over recent years and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. For instance, in 2017, ARRIS acquired the Ruckus Wireless and ICX Switch business (Ruckus Networks); in 2016, ARRIS combined with Pace plc (Pace); and in 2015, CommScope acquired TE Connectivity\u2019s BNS business. We anticipate that a portion of any future growth of our business will be accomplished by acquiring existing businesses, products or technologies. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain the necessary financing on acceptable terms. We may spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or investment targets but not complete the transaction.\nAny future acquisition could involve risks, including the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses, issuance of debt, incurrence of transaction and integration costs, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, assumption of unknown contingent liabilities and unanticipated litigation costs. Furthermore, such acquisition may be dilutive to our financial results. There are also significant challenges to integrating an acquired operation into our business, including, but not limited to successfully managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; integrating the sales organizations; maintaining and increasing the customer base; retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors; integrating management information systems, including ERP systems; integrating inventory management and accounting activities; integrating R&D activities; navigating markets in which we potentially have limited or no prior experience; integrating and implementing effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting; addressing operating losses that may exist related to individual markets, facilities or product lines; and the impact of goodwill or other impairment charges, amortization costs for acquired intangible assets and acquisition accounting treatment, including the loss of deferred revenue and increases in the fair values of inventory and other acquired assets, on our GAAP financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of the recent acquisition of ARRIS, as well as past and future acquisitions and investments, we cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, synergies and growth prospects will be achieved.\nWe may sell or discontinue one or more of our product lines as a result of our evaluation of our products and markets.\nWe periodically evaluate our various product lines and may consider the divestiture or discontinuance of one or more of those product lines. Any such divestiture or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Divestitures of product lines have inherent risks, including the expense of selling the product line; the possibility that any anticipated sale will not occur; possible delays in closing any sale; the risk of lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of the divested business; unexpected costs, including those associated with the separation of the business to be sold, from our management information and other operating systems; distracting employees; potential post-closing claims for indemnification; and potential loss of customers. Expected cost savings may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to a fixed cost structure, and we may experience varying success in the timely reduction of fixed costs or transferring of liabilities previously associated with the divested or discontinued business.\nDifficulties may be encountered in the realignment of manufacturing capacity and capabilities among our global manufacturing facilities and our contract manufacturers that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products.\nWe periodically realign manufacturing capacity among our global facilities and contract manufacturers in order to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to strengthen our long-term competitive position. The implementation of these initiatives may include significant shifts of production capacity among facilities and contract manufacturers. For example, with the current U.S. trade tariff environment, we are transitioning manufacturing for certain impacted products to non-tariff countries. It is time-consuming and costly, and changes in our contract manufacturers or manufacturing locations may cause significant interruptions in supply if the manufacturers have difficulty manufacturing products to our specifications. There are significant risks inherent in the implementation of these initiatives, including our failure to ensure the following: adequate inventory on hand or production capacity to meet customer demand while capacity is being shifted among facilities; maintaining product quality as a result of shifting capacity; adequate raw material and other service providers to meet the needs at the new production locations; ability to successfully remove, transport and re-install equipment; and availability of adequate supervisory, production and support personnel to accommodate the shifted production. In the event manufacturing realignment initiatives are not successfully implemented, we could experience lost future sales and increased operating costs, as well as customer relations problems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may need to undertake additional restructuring actions in the future.\nWe have previously recognized restructuring charges in response to slowdowns in demand for our products and in conjunction with the implementation of initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency of our operations. Most recently, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to support the integration of ARRIS, which include mostly workforce reductions, and in the past, we have undertaken initiatives to support the integration of other acquisitions, which included the closure of certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities and various other workforce reductions. As a result of the continued integration efforts related to the acquisition of ARRIS, changes in business conditions and other developments, we may need to initiate additional restructuring actions that could result in workforce reductions and restructuring charges, which could adversely and materially affect our cash flows.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nSee Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for additional details of our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $10.0 billion of indebtedness. This includes indebtedness issued prior to the Acquisition and indebtedness issued in connection with the Acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding loans under our new asset-based revolving credit facility and approximately $796.8 million in borrowing capacity. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility depends, in part, on inventory, accounts receivable and other assets that fluctuate from time to time and may further depend on lenders\u2019 discretionary ability to impose reserves and availability blocks. We have entered into certain hedging agreements to reduce our exposure to variable rate debt.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as the interest cost on a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022\nhinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses.\nOur variable rate indebtedness currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. On July 27, 2017, the authority that regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom (U.K.), the U.S. or elsewhere. These changes could require us to renegotiate certain of our variable rate indebtedness to address changes in the benchmark rates.\nIn addition, the indentures and credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. Although the indentures and the credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions permit us to incur obligations that, although preferential to our common stock in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness.\nTo service our indebtedness and pay dividends on our preferred stock, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur operations are conducted through our global subsidiaries and our ability to make cash payments on our indebtedness and pay cash dividends on our preferred stock will depend on the level of earnings and distributable funds from our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries may have limitations or restrictions on paying dividends and otherwise transferring funds to us. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to achieve a level of cash flows from operating activities or transfer sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness and dividends on our preferred stock.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness or if we fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness and we are unable to obtain waivers from the required lenders, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. The lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. As a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf we do not obtain the necessary stockholder approval, we may not be able to pay dividends in kind on our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nAt the 2020 Annual Meeting, our stockholders will be asked to vote on a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of common stock to Carlyle in connection with any future conversion or redemption of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock, any issuance of common stock to Carlyle as a dividend-in-kind, or pursuant to Carlyle\u2019s participation rights, which, absent such approval, would be prohibited under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635. If this approval is not obtained, we could be unable to issue shares of common stock to Carlyle in excess of the maximum amount permitted under the listing rules of NASDAQ and, as a result, we would have to settle certain obligations to Carlyle in cash. In addition, if this approval is not obtained, we will not be able to pay dividends-in-kind on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. To the extent that we are not able to pay dividends-in-kind, we will have to pay dividends in cash, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital, debt reduction, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.\nWe may need to recognize additional impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets.\nWe have substantial balances of goodwill and identified intangible assets. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill and identified intangible assets represented approximately 67% of our total assets. We are required to test goodwill for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. In connection with our annual assessment for impairment of goodwill in 2019, we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of $376.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. If we are unable to improve our results of operations and cash flows, or other indicators of impairment exist, such as a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, we may incur another, material charge against earnings relating to our remaining goodwill.\nWe are also required to evaluate identified intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment. In the past, due to revisions in financial performance outlooks or deterioration in certain markets, we have recognized significant impairment charges on identified intangible assets and fixed assets. In the future, we may again determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired and additional impairment charges may be recognized that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant variability in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate.\nWe have a large and complex international tax profile and a significant level of tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. and other carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international activities, identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties and the inability to realize tax credits and other carryforwards included in deferred tax assets, among other matters, have impacted our effective income tax rate in the past and may impact our effective income tax rate in the future. Tax law changes in the U.S. and certain other countries have also impacted our effective income tax rate in the past and may impact our effective tax rate in the future. A significant increase in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are commonly audited by various tax authorities, and some jurisdictions, both in the U.S. and abroad, have become more aggressive in their approach to audits and their enforcement of their applicable tax laws. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made and on our overall effective income tax rate.\nThe IRS may not agree ARRIS was a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nFollowing the Pace combination, ARRIS was incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and a tax resident in the United Kingdom for U.K. tax purposes. There is a risk that the Internal Revenue Service does not agree that ARRIS was a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in periods prior to the Acquisition and we could be subject to substantial additional U.S. taxes. For U.K. tax purposes, ARRIS was expected to be treated as a U.K. tax resident for all periods prior to the Acquisition and following the Pace combination, regardless of how ARRIS was treated in the U.S. Therefore, if ARRIS was treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be liable for both U.S. and U.K. taxes in certain periods prior to the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLabor Related Risks\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key employees.\nOur business depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees. Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. We depend on our senior management team and other key employees for strategic success. Some of our key employees have retired, announced their decision to retire or are at or near retirement age. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nKey employees include individuals in our sales force, operations management, engineers and skilled production workers at our operations around the world. Competition for skilled personnel and highly qualified managers in the industries in which we operate is intense. Our growth by acquisitions creates challenges in retaining employees as well. As the corporate culture evolves to incorporate new workforces, some employees may not find the new culture appealing. In addition, the pace of integration may cause retention issues with our workforce due to integration fatigue.\nFurthermore, as our workforce ages, we are challenged to find and attract a younger population to replace them. Younger generations are motivated by progression and opportunity, which may be limited by our current employee population. In addition, many of our employees are highly experienced, skilled individuals who have extensive knowledge or relationships in our industry. As these employees leave CommScope, we may not be able to easily replicate their experience, knowledge and relationships. Difficulties in attracting or retaining employees with the necessary management, technical and financial skills needed to achieve our business objectives may limit our growth potential and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough none of our U.S. employees are represented by unions, a significant portion of our international employees are members of unions or subject to works\u2019 councils or similar statutory arrangements. We are required to consult with, and seek the consent or advice of, various employee groups or works\u2019 councils that represent our employees for any changes to our activities or employee benefits. This requirement could have a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes. In addition, many of our direct and indirect customers and vendors have unionized workforces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us at our international locations or experienced by our customers or vendors could have a negative impact on us. Organizations responsible for manufacturing or shipping our products may also be impacted by labor disruptions. Any interruption in the delivery of our products could harm our reputation with our customers, reduce demand for our products, increase costs and have a material adverse effect on us.\nInternational Risks\nOur significant international operations expose us to economic, political and other risks.\nWe have significant international sales, manufacturing, distribution and R&D operations. Our major international manufacturing, distribution and R&D facilities are located in Australia, Belgium, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Singapore, Sweden and the United Kingdom. For the year ended December 31, 2019, international sales represented 41% of our consolidated net sales. In general, our international sales have lower gross margin percentages than our domestic sales. To the extent international sales increase as a percentage of our net sales, our overall gross margin percentages may decline.\nOur international sales, manufacturing, distribution and R&D operations are subject to the risks inherent in operating abroad, including, but not limited to, coordinating communications among and managing international operations; currency exchange rate fluctuations; economic and political destabilization; restrictive actions by foreign governments; wage inflation; nationalizations; the laws and policies of the U.S. and other countries affecting trade, anti-bribery, foreign investment and loans; foreign tax laws, including the ability to recover amounts paid as value-added and similar taxes; potential restrictions on the repatriation of cash; reduced protection of intellectual property; longer customer payment cycles; compliance with local laws and regulations; volatile geopolitical turmoil, including popular uprisings, regional conflicts, terrorism, and war; shipping interruptions; major health concerns (such as infectious diseases); inflexible labor contracts or labor laws in the event of business downturns; and economic boycott for doing business in certain countries.\nA significant portion of our products sold in the U.S. are manufactured outside the U.S. We utilize lower-cost geographies for high labor content products while investing in largely automated plants in higher-cost regions close to customers. Most of our manufacturing employees are located in lower-cost geographies such as Mexico, China, India and the Czech Republic. To the extent there are changes in U.S. trade policies, such as significant increases in tariffs or duties for goods brought into the U.S., our competitive position may be adversely impacted and the resulting effect on our earnings could be material. For a more complete discussion of our risks related to trade policies, see the risk factor \u201cAdditional tariffs or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products\u201d under \u201cInternational Risks\u201d in this Item 1A. Risk Factors section.\nIn June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as Brexit. As a result of the referendum, the British government began negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. in March 2017. The U.K. and E.U. entered into a withdrawal agreement whereby the U.K. left the E.U. as of January 31, 2020 but maintained access to the E.U. single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the E.U. on behalf of its members and remained subject to E.U. law, for a transition period ending on December 31, 2020. The ongoing uncertainty within the U.K.\u2019s government on the status of Brexit has negatively impacted the U.K.\u2019s economy and will likely continue to have a negative impact until a definitive resolution is reached on the outstanding trade and legal matters. Even if the U.K. maintains access to the E.U. single market and trade deals following the transition period, Brexit could result in further economic downturn globally. If the U.K. ultimately loses access to the E.U. single market and trade deals, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business and the business of existing and future customers and suppliers as well as have an impact on our employees based in Europe, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks related to fluctuations in foreign currency rates can impact our sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our foreign currency risk exposure is mainly concentrated in Chinese yuan, euro, British pound sterling, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, South African rand, Indian rupee and Czech koruna. We manage our foreign currency rate risks through regular operating and financing activities and use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts. There can be no assurance that our risk management strategies will be effective or that the counterparties to our derivative contracts will be able to perform. In addition, foreign currency rates in many of the countries in which we operate have at times been extremely volatile and unpredictable. We may choose not to hedge or determine we are unable to effectively hedge the risks associated with this volatility. In such cases, we may experience declines in sales and adverse impacts on earnings and such changes could be material.\nAdditional tariffs or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products.\nDuring 2018 and 2019, the U.S. administration announced tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., which has resulted in reciprocal tariffs from other countries, including countries where we operate. For example, the U.S. has implemented tariffs on a variety of goods produced or manufactured in China, and China responded by imposing tariffs on various U.S. products. In January 2020, the two sides signed a preliminary deal, but many issues remain unresolved. Both sides have indicated that further revisions will be made during a second phase of negotiations, but the timing of any such negotiations and resolution remain uncertain. The U.S. has renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. The renegotiated agreement, called the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), was recently ratified by Congress but remains subject to approval by the Canadian legislature, and the timing of approval is uncertain.\nThese developments have created uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and certain of its trading partners and may reduce trade between the U.S. and other nations, including countries in which we currently operate. Changes in policy or continued uncertainty could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers. The tariffs implemented on our products (or on materials, parts or components we use to manufacture our products) by the U.S. will increase the cost of our products manufactured and imported into the U.S. Tariffs and other trade restrictions announced by other countries on products manufactured in the U.S. could likewise increase the costs of those products when imported into other countries. If additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented on our products (or on materials, parts or components we use to manufacture our products) by the U.S. or other countries, the cost of our products manufactured in China, Mexico or other countries and imported into the U.S. or other countries could increase further. We expect to continue to pass along some of these costs to our customers, but the increased cost could adversely affect the demand for products. We are in the process of shifting the manufacturing locations for the impacted products, but this takes time and these locations may have higher manufacturing costs. These cost increases could adversely affect the demand for our products and/or reduce margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our earnings.\nOur international operations expose us to increased challenges in complying with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various other international jurisdictions.\nWe are required to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various other international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, we are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, our employees, subcontractors or channel partners could take actions that violate these requirements. In addition, some of the international jurisdictions in which we operate have elevated levels of corruption. As a result, we are exposed to an increased risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violation of anti-corruption laws could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and such effects could be material.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nCertain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exemption. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign import and customs rules, sanctions and embargos. If we were to fail to comply with applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in a delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nFurthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure you that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. Any such shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm.\nAny change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in our decreased ability to export, import or sell our products to existing or potential customers, particularly those with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import or sell our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and such effects could be material.\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and in defending claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property of others and such actions may be costly.\nWe may encounter difficulties and significant costs in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property to permit us to continue or expand our business. Other companies, including some of our largest competitors, hold intellectual property rights in our industry and the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products unless we secure necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn the past, we have initiated litigation in order to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and/or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights, and we may initiate similar litigation in the future. We also have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, including against certain of the products or intellectual property that we have acquired through acquisitions. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome, could be costly and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using proprietary third-party technology. In addition, the payment of any damages or any necessary licensing fees or indemnification costs associated with a patent infringement claim could be material and could also materially adversely affect our operating results. Such litigation can also be a significant distraction to management.\nIn certain markets, we may be required to address counterfeit versions of our products. We may incur significant costs in pursuing the originators of such counterfeit products and, if we are unsuccessful in eliminating them from the market, we may experience a reduction in the value of our products and/or a reduction in our net sales.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and potential environmental liabilities may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations regarding the types of substances allowable in certain of our products and the handling of our products at the end of their useful life. Because of the nature of our business, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with or liability under these environmental laws and regulations and these costs could be material. In addition, new laws and regulations, new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, expansion of existing legal requirements related to our products, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation or discharge requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nEfforts to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide, are underway in the U.S. and other countries, which could increase the cost of raw materials, production processes and transportation of our products. If we are unable to comply with such regulations or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased costs of compliance, GHG regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Certain environmental laws impose strict and, in some circumstances, joint and several liability on current or former owners or operators of a contaminated property, as well as companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a contaminated property, for the costs of investigation and remediation of the contaminated property. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years and over that time, in the course of those operations, hazardous substances and wastes have been used, generated and occasionally disposed of at such facilities, and we have disposed of waste products either directly or through third parties at numerous disposal sites. Consequently, it has been necessary to undertake investigation and remediation projects at certain sites and we have been, and may in the future be, held responsible for a portion of the investigation and clean-up costs at these sites and our share of those costs may be material.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have also introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our venture partners, and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation.\nCommon Stock Ownership Risks\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of investors to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. The payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors; however, the indentures and the credit agreements governing our indebtedness place limitations on our ability to pay dividends. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to reduce our debt and fund our growth and our Board of Directors may choose to provide returns to our stockholders through share repurchases. The success of an investment in our common stock will largely depend upon future appreciation in value, and there can be no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize 1,300,000,000 shares of common stock, which, to the extent unissued, could be issued by the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance, without stockholder approval, of blank check preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\ngrant to the Board of Directors the sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to remove directors only \u201cfor cause\u201d and require any such removal to be approved by holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, with three staggered terms; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws and certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company and may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those our stockholders may desire.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others.\nStockholder activism has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years and we are subject to the risks associated with such activism, particularly due to the overall decline in our stock price over the last two years. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant legal fees and other costs, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact the trading value of our securities. Additionally, stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key executives and business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.", "PERMNO": 14239, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "COMM"}
