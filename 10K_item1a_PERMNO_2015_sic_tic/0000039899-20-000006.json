RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties and investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.\nWe are impacted by demand for advertising, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, some of which are cyclical and many of which are beyond our control\nIn 2019, 55% of our revenues were derived from television spot and digital advertising. Demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the U.S. economy, both in the markets our stations serve and in the nation as a whole. During an economic downturn, demand for advertising often decreases. Consequently, our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. A decline in economic conditions in the U.S. could have a significant adverse impact on our businesses and could significantly impact our television spot and digital advertising revenues.\nOur advertising revenues can also vary substantially from year to year, driven by the political election cycle (i.e., even years); the ability and willingness of candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising; and the competitiveness of the election races in our stations\u2019 markets. Advertising revenues will also vary based on the coverage of major sporting events (e.g., Olympics and Super Bowl) due to our high concentration of NBC stations.\nCompetition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in traditional and new businesses\nAdvertising and marketing services produce the majority of our revenues, with our stations\u2019 affiliated desktop, mobile and tablet advertising revenues, as well as our OTT product offerings being important components. Technology, particularly new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies used in the entertainment industry continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through so-called \u201ccutting the cord\u201d and other consumption strategies.\nThese innovations may affect our ability to generate television audience, which may make our television stations less attractive to advertisers. For example, increasing demand for content generated for consumption through other forms of media such as Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBO Go, Hulu, or Netflix, could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings of our programming, which may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nThe value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, broadcasting disruptions, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.\nOur efforts to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity incidents and to protect our technology and confidential information may not be successful and our business could be negatively affected\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. As such, we are exposed to various cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to, threats to our information technology infrastructure, and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our confidential information, including third parties which receive our confidential information for business purposes. We take measures to minimize the risk of a cyber-attack including utilization of multi-factor authentication, deployment of firewalls, virtual private networks for mobile connections and conducting regular training of our employees related to protecting sensitive information and recognizing \u201cphishing\u201d attacks. These measures, however, may not be sufficient in preventing or the timely\ndetection of breaches or cyber-attacks due to the evolving nature and ever-increasing abilities of cyber-attacks. Depending on the severity of the breach or cyber-attack, such events could result in business interruptions, disclosure of nonpublic information, loss of sales and customers, misstated financial data, liabilities for stolen assets or information, diversion of our management\u2019s attention, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, and financial consequences, any or all of which could adversely affect our business operations and reputation. In addition, cybersecurity breaches could subject us to civil liability to customers and other third parties as well as fines and penalties imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities which could be substantial. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from breaches of our systems.\nAs has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of, or changes in, affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our stations\nMost of our stations are covered by our network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations\u2019 commitment to air the programming at specified times and for other consideration such as commercial announcement time during the programming. The cost of network affiliation agreements represents a significant portion of our television operating expenses.\nEach of our affiliation agreements has a stated expiration date. With respect to the major broadcast networks, our principal expirations occur in the following years: NBC-early 2021, CBS-2022, Fox-2022, ABC-2023. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues.\nIn recent years, the networks have streamed their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms, in some cases live or within a short period of the original network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own. An increase in the availability of network programming on alternative platforms that either bypass or provide less favorable terms to local stations - such as cable channels, the Internet and other distribution vehicles - may dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.\nOur retransmission consent agreements with major cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers permit them to retransmit our stations\u2019 signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us (which we classify as subscription revenues). This source of revenue represented approximately 44% of our 2019 total revenues, and we expect the contribution of subscription revenues to increase in 2020 and to continue to increase in the foreseeable future periods. During 2019, retransmission consent agreements covering approximately 50% of our subscribers were renewed. During 2020, retransmission consent agreements covering approximately 35% or our subscribers expire. If we are unable to negotiate and renew these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase our subscription revenues, negatively impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate our business in a single broadcast segment, which increases our exposure to the changes and highly competitive environment of the broadcast industry\nBroadcast companies operate in a highly competitive environment and compete for audiences, advertising and marketing services revenue and quality programing. Lower audience share, declines in advertising and marketing services spending, and increased programming costs would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition and consolidation in the media marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the FCC and Congress are contemplating several new laws and changes to existing media ownership and other broadcast-related regulations, regarding a wide range of matters (including permitting companies to own more stations in a single market, as well as owning more stations nationwide). Changes to FCC rules may lead to additional opportunities as well as increased uncertainty in the industry.\nChanging regulations may also impair or reduce our leverage in negotiating affiliation or retransmission agreements, adversely affecting our revenues, or result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our television stations are required to hold television broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances, the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew future license applications.\nChanges in the regulatory environment could increase our costs or limit our opportunities for growth\nOur television stations are subject to various obligations and restrictions under the Communications Act of 1934 as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d), and FCC regulations. These requirements may be affected by legislation, FCC actions, or court decisions, and any such changes may affect the performance of our business, such as by imposing new obligations or by limiting our television stations\u2019 exclusivity or retransmission consent rights. For instance, although the FCC voted in November 2017 to reduce restrictions on local broadcast ownership, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated and remanded these changes effective as of November 29, 2019. These regulatory changes could be restored by further appeals or could be affected in the future by Congress or the FCC. If broadcast ownership rules become more restrictive, our opportunities to grow our broadcast business through acquisitions or other strategic transactions could be impaired.\nThere could be significant liability if the spin-off of Cars.com was determined to be a taxable transaction\nIn May 2017 we completed our spin-off of Cars.com, which we refer to as the \u201dspin-off\u201d. In connection with the spin-off, we received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code were satisfied. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and the spun-off business regarding the past and future conduct of the company\u2019s business and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nNotwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or the spun-off business after the separation. If the spin-off was determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nOur proxy contest with Standard General L.P. has caused and could continue to cause us to incur significant costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business\nActivist shareholders, like Standard General, may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to affect changes or acquire control over us. Responding to these actions can be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our Board and management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies, particularly if such activist shareholders advocate actions that are not supported by other shareholders, our board or management. In 2019, we incurred advisory fees of $6.1 million related to the pending proxy contest with Standard General, and have incurred additional costs in the first quarter of 2020. In addition to the incurred costs, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nOur strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and may significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitability\nAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources. We may be unable to successfully complete acquisitions, implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. Acquisitions may result in us assuming unexpected liabilities and in management diverting its attention from the operation of our business. Acquisitions may result in us having greater exposure to the industry risks of the businesses underlying the acquisition. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may be unable to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. We are exposed to the risk that our partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could disrupt investee or partnership activities, or impair assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity. The failure to obtain regulatory approvals or required consents of broadcast television networks or other third parties may prevent us from completing or realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nVolatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations and strategic initiatives or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates and terms as it matures\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $4.2 billion in debt and approximately $594.8 million of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2024. This debt matures at various times during the years 2020-2029. While our cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if our operating results deteriorate significantly, we may not be able to pay amounts when due and a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer-term financing is generally unpredictable and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings.\nThe value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating results\nGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $5.51 billion as of December 31, 2019, representing approximately 79% of our total assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstance that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary. We may subsequently experience market pressures which could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.", "PERMNO": 47941, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "TGNA"}
