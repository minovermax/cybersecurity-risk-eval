Risk Factors.\nThe Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock. The risks described below are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or other factors that the Company does not presently perceive to present significant risks to the Company at this time may also impair the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or the value of the Company\u2019s common stock. The risks discussed below also include forward looking statements, and actual results and events may differ substantially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I, Item 1 of this Report.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, negative impacts on the Company\u2019s business, results and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been, and continues to be, an unprecedented disruption in the economy and has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the Company\u2019s business and results. Specifically, beginning at the end of the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic disruption caused delays and declines in the placement of customer orders, the completion of equipment and parts installations, and the fulfillment of parts orders. The COVID-19 pandemic, while showing initial signs of recovery earlier in fiscal 2021 has recently had a resurgence with the increased presence and spread of the Delta variant. Accordingly, the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue in the near-term and possibly longer, including, without limitation, if the pandemic increases in size and scope, its duration is prolonged, or, among other matters related thereto, additional governmental actions, including, without limitation, business restrictions, are imposed. In response to the economic and business disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, the Company took actions to reduce costs and spending across the organization, including changes to inventory stock levels, renegotiating payment terms with suppliers, and reducing hiring activities. The Company continues to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions, including those that may alter business operations, if required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities or otherwise determined to be advisable by management.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that have impacted, or may negatively impact, the Company\u2019s business and results, including sales and gross margin, in the future include, but are not limited to: potential limitations on the ability of suppliers to manufacture, or the Company\u2019s ability to procure from manufacturers, the products the Company sells, or to meet delivery requirements and commitments; limitations on the ability of the Company\u2019s employees to perform their work due to impacts caused by the pandemic or local, state, federal or foreign orders that may restrict the Company\u2019s operations or the operations of its customers, or require that employees be quarantined; limitations on the ability of carriers to deliver products to the Company\u2019s facilities and customers; adverse impacts of the pandemic on certain industries and customers of the Company which operate in those industries, including the hospitality industry; and potential decreased demand for products and services, including potential limitations on the ability of, or adverse changes in the desire of, the Company\u2019s customers to conduct their business, purchase products and services and pay for purchases on a timely basis or at all.\nThe situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid and highly uncertain. The Company is unable to determine or predict the nature, duration, or scope of the overall impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition, as such impact will depend in large part on future developments, including the severity and duration of the pandemic (including the Delta variant and any other future variants) and government and other actions taken in response thereto, all of which are highly uncertain. Further, even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the Company may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of, among other things, any adverse impact that has occurred or may occur in the future in the economy or markets generally, and changes in customer or supplier behavior.\nDuring May 2020, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries received a total of twelve loans (the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d) totaling approximately $6.9 million in principal amount from Fifth Third Bank, N.A. (the \u201cLender\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) established under the CARES Act. The proceeds of the PPP Loans were used primarily for payroll costs. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company was notified by the Lender that all twelve of the PPP Loans were fully forgiven. The Company recognized a gain of $7.0 million during fiscal 2021 in connection with the forgiveness of the PPP Loans and the related accrued interest. Notwithstanding the forgiveness of the loans, the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) reserves the right to audit the PPP Loans. Any such audit may require significant management attention and the incurrence of significant costs, and an adverse determination could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results and financial condition.\nAcquisitions and the Company\u2019s pursuit of acquisitions and other strategic transactions subject the Company to a number of risks.\nAcquisitions are an important element of the Company\u2019s growth strategy. Acquisitions and the Company\u2019s efforts with respect thereto involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe ability to identify and consummate transactions with acquisition targets;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nthe successful operation and integration of acquired companies;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business functions and operations;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nstrain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\ndifficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at the acquired businesses;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\npossible loss of key employees and/or customer or supplier relationships of the acquired business (See \u201cThe Company\u2019s business and results may be adversely impacted if the Company does not maintain its relationships with its significant suppliers or customers\u201d below); and\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nexposure to liabilities of the acquired businesses.\u2009\u2009\nAs a result of these or other problems and risks, acquired businesses may not produce the revenues, earnings, cash flows or business synergies anticipated, and the acquired businesses may not perform as expected. As a result, the Company may incur higher costs and realize lower revenues and earnings than anticipated. The Company may not be able to successfully address these problems, integrate any acquired businesses or generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other negative effects on its business.\nIn addition, acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of the Company\u2019s equity securities and the incurrence of debt. See \u201cRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Indebtedness - The Company\u2019s indebtedness may impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of the Company\u2019s indebtedness may place restrictions on the Company\u201d below. Acquisitions may also result in contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition or results. Further, there are risks related to the accounting for acquisitions, including that preliminary valuations are subject to change and any such change may impact the Company\u2019s results (including in the event of any change which results in an adjustment to the bargain purchase gain recognized by the Company in connection with its acquisition of Baystate Business Ventures (d/b/a Eastern Laundry Systems) during January 2021 as described in further detail elsewhere in this Report).\nRapid growth may place significant demands on management, as well as on the Company\u2019s accounting, financial, information and other systems and on the Company\u2019s business. Further, management may not be able to manage the Company\u2019s growth effectively or successfully, and the Company\u2019s financial, accounting, information and other systems may not be able to successfully accommodate the Company\u2019s growth. In addition, the Company\u2019s accounting and other professional expenses associated with being a public company have increased as a result of the Company\u2019s growth, including the increase in the Company\u2019s market capitalization, and such expenses may continue to increase in the future.\nFurther, the Company may not be successful in consummating acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Expenses related to the Company\u2019s pursuit of acquisitions and other strategic transactions may be significant and will be incurred by the Company regardless of whether the underlying acquisition or other strategic transaction is ultimately consummated.\nConditions beyond the Company\u2019s control can interrupt the Company\u2019s supplies, increase its product costs and impair its ability to deliver products and services to its customers.\nThe Company obtains its products from third-party suppliers. Although purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not be able to provide the products and supplies that the Company needs in the quantities and at the prices requested, including due to conditions outside of the supplier\u2019s control. The Company is also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of the Company\u2019s control. These conditions include shortages of qualified labor for suppliers, work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, weather conditions transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, product recalls, competitive demands, civil insurrection or social unrest, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other disease outbreaks or other catastrophic events. Many of these conditions outside of the Company\u2019s control and could also impair the Company\u2019s ability to provide its products and services to its customers or increase the cost of doing so. The current operating environment is constantly shifting in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, placing significant pressure on the supply chain. In many instances, customer demand is outpacing available supply, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, delays in delivering products or services to the Company\u2019s customers. The inability to obtain adequate supplies of products and/or to timely provide products and services and fulfill the Company\u2019s other obligations to its customers, whether as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including, without limitation, if the Company\u2019s customers turn to other distributors.\nThe Company\u2019s business and results may be adversely affected if the Company does not maintain its relationships with its significant suppliers or customers.\nWhile the Company purchases the products it distributes from a number of manufacturers and suppliers, purchases from three manufacturers accounted for a total of approximately 62% and 63% of the Company\u2019s product purchases for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. The Company has not historically experienced difficulty in purchasing products it distributes, and believes it has good working relationships with the manufacturers or suppliers from which the Company purchases its products. However, if such relationships deteriorate or the Company is unable to maintain such relationships, including with any of its or its acquired businesses\u2019 principal manufacturers or suppliers, the Company\u2019s business and results could be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, efforts of the Company and its acquired businesses to mitigate any loss, including brand shifts, may not be successful. Further, the Company does not have contracts with all of its manufacturers, and the contracts the Company does have are generally short term agreements and can be terminated on short notice. In addition, suppliers may not comply with the terms of any agreements or may choose to terminate such agreements, allow such agreements to expire without renewal, or seek to revise the agreements on terms which are less favorable to the Company than the prevailing terms, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results.\nIn addition, while the Company distributes its products to various users, including, but not limited to, vended laundry facilities, industrial laundry facilities, government institutions, correctional facilities, hospitals, hospital combines, nursing homes, veterinary clinics, professional sports franchises, educational institutions, hotels, motels, food and beverage establishments, cruise lines, and specialized users, the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted if the Company loses a significant customer or fails to meet its customers\u2019 expectations.\nThe products the Company distributes could fail to perform according to specifications or prove to be unreliable, which could damage the Company\u2019s customer relationships and industry reputation and result in lawsuits and loss of sales.\nThe Company\u2019s customers require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability. Product defects or other failures to perform to specifications or as expected could result in higher service costs and may damage the Company\u2019s customer relationships and industry reputation and/or otherwise negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, operations and results. Further, the Company may be subject to lawsuits if, among other things, any of the products it distributes fails to operate properly or causes property or other physical damage.\nThe Company faces substantial competition.\nThe commercial and industrial laundry, dry cleaning equipment and boiler distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented, with over 500 full-line or partial-line equipment distributors in the United States. The Company\u2019s management believes that no single competitor of the Company has a major share of the market, substantially all competitors are independently owned, and, with the exception of several regional distributors, distributors operate primarily in local markets. In the United States, the Company\u2019s primary competition is from a number of independently owned distributors and certain manufacturers which own distribution businesses operating in North America. In foreign markets, the Company also competes with independently owned distributors and manufacturer-owned distribution businesses. Certain of the Company\u2019s competitors may have greater financial and other resources than the Company. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors may have less indebtedness than the Company, and therefore may have more cash and working capital available for business purposes other than debt service. The Company\u2019s results and financial condition would be materially and adversely impacted if the Company is unable to compete effectively. Further, the Company may not be able to adjust efficiently or effectively or otherwise operate profitably if the competitive environment changes.\nThe Company faces risks associated with environmental and other regulation.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental and other laws and regulations, including environmental laws governing the discharge of pollutants, the handling, generation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, substances, and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. As a public company, the Company will also be subject to any rules and regulation of the SEC concerning environmental and other social issues, which may result in increased costs and compliance efforts. The Company is also subject to rules and regulations with respect to its contracts and dealings with government facilities. The Company may not remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and could be required to incur significant costs as a result of violations of, liabilities under, or efforts to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. In addition, violations may have other adverse implications for the Company, including negative public relations and potential litigation. Further, the Company may incur significant compliance costs in the event of changes to applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Company faces risks related to its foreign sales.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues from foreign sales relate principally to the Company\u2019s sales of commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and boilers to Canada, the Caribbean, Latin America and Asia. All of the Company\u2019s foreign sales require the customer to make payment in United States dollars. Foreign sales may be affected by the strength of the United States dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which customers and competitors are located, as well as the strength of the economies of the countries in which the Company\u2019s customers are located.\nFurther, conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties, risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u2022\nexport and trade restrictions,\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\ninconsistent and changing regulatory requirements,\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers,\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\ncultural issues,\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nproblems in collecting accounts receivable,\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\npolitical instability,\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nlocal economic downturns, and\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\u2009\u2009\nAny of the above factors may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nDamages to or disruptions at the Company\u2019s facilities or the facilities of a supplier could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nAlthough the Company has certain limited protection afforded by insurance, the Company\u2019s business, earnings and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if it suffers damages to, or disruptions at, its facilities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company\u2019s facilities in Florida, Georgia, Texas and the Northeast United States are subject to hurricane casualty and flood risk and its facilities in California are subject to earthquake casualty risk. In addition, as described above, damages to the facility of a supplier, whether due to, fire, natural disaster or other events, would adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain products from that supplier when expected or at all and, accordingly, may result in delays in the delivery of the Company\u2019s products or the provision of its services and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s assets may suffer uninsured losses.\nThe Company attempts to ensure that its assets, including the equipment and parts that it sells, are adequately insured to cover property and casualty losses as well as any other liabilities to which the Company is reasonably expected to be subject. However, insurance may be expensive or difficult to obtain, and there are certain types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, pollution, fire or environmental disasters or other matters, which are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. In addition, there may in certain cases be questions as to when the risk of loss related to products sold is transferred to the customer. If the equipment suffers a loss and risk of loss is deemed not to have transferred to the customer, the Company may be liable for the loss, which may not be insured. If the Company\u2019s insurance coverage is not adequate, or the Company otherwise incurs uninsured losses, the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition would be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to manage its business and monitor results is highly dependent upon information and communication systems, and a failure of these systems or the Company\u2019s ERP implementation could disrupt its business.\nThe Company is dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate its business, including its enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems. The Company is in the process of implementing across a number of its subsidiaries an ERP software system and related processes to perform various functions and improve on the efficiency of the Company\u2019s business. This is a lengthy and expensive process that will result in a diversion of resources from other operations, and may result in cost overruns, project delays or business interruptions.\nAny disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and/or implementation of the new ERP system, or in the performance of legacy systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact the Company\u2019s operations, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to effectively run and manage its information. Further, as the Company is dependent upon its ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if the Company\u2019s information systems do not allow the Company to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact the Company\u2019s ability to perform necessary business operations, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the information systems of businesses that the Company may acquire may not be sufficient to meet the Company\u2019s standards or the Company may not be able to successfully convert them to provide acceptable information on a timely and cost-effective basis. Furthermore, the Company must attract and retain qualified people to operate its systems, expand and improve them, integrate new programs effectively with its existing programs, and convert to new systems efficiently when required. Any disruption to the Company\u2019s business due to such issues, or an increase in costs to cover these issues that is greater than anticipated, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and operations.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or operational inefficiencies, damage the Company\u2019s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nThe Company collects and retains internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of customers in various internal information systems. The Company also maintains personally identifiable information about its employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to the Company. The Company could make faulty decisions if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. The Company\u2019s customers and employees also have a high expectation that their personal information will be adequately protected. The regulatory environment as well as the requirements imposed on the Company by the payment card industry surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding. The Company\u2019s systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory and payment card industry requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems and records may be subject to security breaches, cyber-attacks, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation. A breach in the security of the Company\u2019s information systems could lead to an interruption in the operation of the Company\u2019s systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and losses. In addition, conversions to new information technology systems require effective change management processes and may result in cost overruns, delays or business interruptions. If the Company\u2019s information technology systems are disrupted, become obsolete or do not adequately support the Company\u2019s strategic, operational or compliance needs, the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Indebtedness\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness may impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of the Company\u2019s indebtedness may place restrictions on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s level of indebtedness may have several important effects on the Company\u2019s operations, including, without limitation, that the Company may be required to use a portion of its cash for the payment of principal and interest due on outstanding indebtedness, that outstanding indebtedness and the Company\u2019s leverage position will increase the impact on the Company of negative changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as competitive pressures, and that the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital or other corporate purposes may be impacted.\nOn November 2, 2018, the Company entered into a syndicated credit agreement (the \u201c2018 Credit Agreement\u201d) for a five-year revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million, with an accordion feature to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $40 million for a total of $140 million. A portion of the revolving credit facility is available for swingline loans of up to a sublimit of $5 million and for the issuance of standby letters of credit of up to a sublimit of $10 million. The Company had $12.0 million outstanding under the 2018 Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2021.\nBorrowings (other than swingline loans) under the 2018 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate, at the Company\u2019s election at the time of borrowing, equal to (a) LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% depending on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio, which is a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) (the \u201cConsolidated Leverage Ratio\u201d) or (b) the highest of (i) prime, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points (such highest rate, the \u201cBase Rate\u201d), plus a margin that ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Swingline loans bear interest calculated at the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio. A significant increase in interest rates could materially impact the cost of the Company\u2019s indebtedness under the 2018 Credit Agreement and any other floating rate debt that the Company may incur in the future. Furthermore, regulatory changes, such as the announcement of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s floating-rate debt. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the Company may need to renegotiate the 2018 Credit Agreement and any other credit agreements it may enter into that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, which could adversely impact the cost of the Company\u2019s debt.\nThe 2018 Credit Agreement contains covenants applicable to the Company, including financial covenants requiring the Company to comply with maximum leverage ratios and minimum interest coverage ratios, as well as other covenants which may place restrictions on, among other things, liens, investments, indebtedness, fundamental changes, acquisitions, dispositions of property, making specified restricted payments (including cash dividends and stock repurchases that would result in the Company exceeding an agreed to Consolidated Leverage Ratio), and transactions with affiliates.\nThe Company may incur additional debt financing as determined to be appropriate by management, including in connection with the financing of acquisitions or otherwise, which would increase the Company\u2019s vulnerability to the risk factors described above related to its level of indebtedness and may place restrictions on the Company similar or in addition to those contained in the 2018 Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that the Company will receive any financing which the Company may seek to obtain in the future on acceptable terms or at all, including in the event additional funds are necessary to consummate an acquisition or support the Company\u2019s business operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nHenry M. Nahmad may be deemed to control the Company.\nHenry M. Nahmad, the Company\u2019s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, may be deemed to control the Company as a result of his voting power over shares representing approximately 53.3% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as of June 30, 2021. The shares over which Mr. Nahmad has voting power include shares subject to restricted stock awards granted to Mr. Nahmad, shares held by Symmetric Capital LLC and Symmetric Capital II LLC, each of which may be deemed to be controlled by Mr. Nahmad as a result of his serving as Manager of such entity, and shares which Symmetric Capital has the right to vote pursuant to a Stockholders Agreement entered into with WSD, Dennis Mack, a director and Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy of the Company, and Tom Marks, Executive Vice President, Business Development of the Company. A copy of such Stockholders Agreements is filed as an exhibit to this Report. Under the Company\u2019s Bylaws, the election of directors requires a plurality vote and all other matters put to a vote of the Company\u2019s stockholders require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock represented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the matter unless a greater percentage is required by applicable law. Consequently, other than in very limited circumstances where a greater vote is required by applicable law, Mr. Nahmad, without the consent or vote of any other stockholders of the Company, has the voting power to elect directors and approve other actions that require stockholder approval. Mr. Nahmad\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders. In addition, Mr. Nahmad\u2019s control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in management and/or adversely impact the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock or the ability of the Company\u2019s other stockholders to receive a premium for their shares in connection with any sale of the Company.\nFurther, as a result of Mr. Nahmad\u2019s controlling voting position with respect to the Company\u2019s common stock, the Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE American, on which the Company\u2019s common stock is listed. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d the Company is not required under the listing standards of the NYSE American to comply with certain corporate governance requirements set forth therein, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors consists of independent directors;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nthe requirement that nominating and corporate governance matters be decided solely by a nominating/corporate governance committee consisting of independent directors; and\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nthe requirement that executive compensation matters be decided by a compensation committee consisting of independent directors.\u2009\u2009\nWhile executive compensation matters are determined by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors is currently comprised of a majority of independent directors, the Company does not have a standing nominating/corporate governance committee and the Company has in the past from time to time maintained a Board of Directors not comprised of a majority of independent directors. In addition, in the discretion of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, the Company may choose to utilize or continue to utilize any or all of the exceptions in the future. As a result, the Company\u2019s stockholders may not have certain of the same protections as a stockholder of other publicly-traded companies and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be adversely affected.\nThe concentration of ownership with respect to the Company\u2019s common stock also results in there being a limited trading volume, which may make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares and increase the price volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company may avail itself of reduced disclosure requirements, which may make the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nUnder applicable SEC rules and regulations, the Company is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and will continue to be a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates as of the end of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter is less than $250 million. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company has relied on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies. The Company may continue to rely on such exemptions for so long as the Company remains a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. The Company\u2019s reliance on these exemptions may result in the public finding the Company\u2019s common stock to be less attractive and adversely impact the market price of, or trading market for, the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe issuance of preferred stock and common stock, and the authority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to approve issuances of preferred stock and common stock, could adversely affect the rights of the Company\u2019s stockholders and have an anti-takeover effect.\nAs permitted by Delaware law, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors is authorized under the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), to approve the issuance by the Company of up to 200,000 shares of preferred stock, and to designate the relative rights, preferences and limitations of any preferred stock so issued, in each case, without any further action on the part of the Company\u2019s stockholders. Currently, no shares of preferred stock are outstanding. In the event that the Company issues preferred stock in the future that has preference over the Company\u2019s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the rights of holders of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may be adversely affected. In addition, the Company is authorized under its Certificate of Incorporation to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock. There are currently approximately 12.3 million shares of common stock outstanding. Subject to applicable law and the rules and regulations of the NYSE American, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof, in the case of shares issued under the Company\u2019s equity-based compensation plan) has the power to approve the issuance of any authorized but unissued shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and any such issuances, including, without limitation, those under the Company\u2019s equity-based compensation plan or pursuant to any acquisitions consummated by the Company or in connection with the financing thereof, would result in dilution to the Company\u2019s stockholders. These provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation could also delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company or its management, and could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nGeneral Risks\nThe Company is subject to risks relating to evaluations of internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, a substantial amount of management time and resources to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In this Report, the Company\u2019s management has provided an assessment as to the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is subject to attestation by the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. This Report includes such attestation. However, there is no assurance that the Company will continue to timely comply with such requirements nor can there be assurance that significant deficiencies and/or material weaknesses will not be identified by management or the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm (or, if identified, remedied in a timely fashion or at all), any of which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, the Company\u2019s compliance efforts will continue to require significant expenditures and devotion of management time, and may divert management\u2019s attention from the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, while businesses acquired during the fiscal year covered by the applicable Annual Report on Form 10-K are permitted to be excluded from the scope of management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting and the related auditor attestation for such Annual Report on Form 10-K (as is the case with the exclusion of the businesses acquired by the Company in fiscal 2021 from the scope of management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting and the related auditor attestation for this Report), the Company will face challenges and be required to incur expenses in connection with, and devote significant management time to, the internal control over financial reporting of acquired businesses. There is no assurance that any issues, deficiencies or weaknesses identified at acquired businesses will be remedied in a timely or cost-efficient manner or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on the active participation of its executive officers, including Henry M. Nahmad and Tom Marks. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and prospects. In addition, the Company\u2019s success is dependent on its ability to retain and attract additional qualified management and other personnel. Competition for such talent is intense, and the Company may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nLitigation and legal proceedings, the costs of defending the same and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company may from time to time become subject to litigation and other legal proceedings. Litigation and other legal proceedings may require the Company to incur significant expenses, including those relating to legal and other professional fees. In addition, litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes in litigation or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.", "PERMNO": 87437, "SIC": 5080, "TIC": "EVI"}
