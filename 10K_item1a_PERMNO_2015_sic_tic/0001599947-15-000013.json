{"cik": "1599947", "company": "TerraForm Power, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to our Business\nIntegrating the assets we acquired in the First Wind acquisition may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits of the First Wind acquisition may not be realized.\nThe success of the First Wind acquisition, including anticipated benefits, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the assets we acquired with our existing operations. The acquisition of the wind power plants represents a substantial change in the nature of our business, and we may not be able to adapt to such change in a timely manner, or at all. Any difficulties we have in integrating the First Wind assets could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCounterparties to our PPAs may not fulfill their obligations or may seek to terminate the PPA early, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAll but a minor portion of the electric power generated by our current portfolio of solar generation facilities and wind power plants is sold under long-term PPAs with public utilities or commercial, industrial or government end-users or is hedged pursuant to hedge agreements with investment banks and creditworthy counterparties. Call Right Projects we acquire will also have long-term PPAs. Certain of the PPAs associated with solar generation facilities and wind power plants in our portfolio allow the offtake purchaser to terminate the PPA in the event certain operating thresholds or performance measures are not achieved within specified time periods or, in certain instances, by payment of an early termination fee. If a PPA was terminated or if, for any reason, any purchaser of power under these contracts is unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations or refuses to accept delivery of power delivered thereunder, and if we are unable to enter a new PPA on acceptable terms in a timely fashion or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA portion of the revenues under the PPAs for our U.K. projects are subject to price adjustments after a period of time. If the market price of electricity decreases and we are otherwise unable to negotiate more favorable pricing terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe PPAs for the U.K. projects in our portfolio have fixed electricity prices for a specified period of time (typically four years), after which such electricity prices are subject to an adjustment based on the market price at the time of the adjustment. While the PPAs with price adjustments specify a minimum price, the minimum price is significantly below the initial fixed price. A decrease in the market price of electricity, including due to lower prices for traditional fossil fuels, could result in a decrease in the pricing under such contracts if the fixed-price period has expired, unless we are able to negotiate more favorable pricing terms. Any decrease in the price payable to us under our PPAs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nCertain of our PPAs allow the offtake purchaser to buy out a portion of the project upon the occurrence of certain events, in which case we will need to find suitable replacement power generation facilities to invest in.\nCertain of the PPAs for power generation plants in our portfolio or that we may acquire in the future allow the offtake purchaser to purchase all or a portion of the applicable project from us. If the offtake purchaser exercises its right to purchase all or a portion of the project, we would need to reinvest the proceeds from the sale in one or more power generation facilities with similar economic attributes in order to maintain our cash available for distribution. If we were unable to locate and acquire suitable replacement power generation facilities in a timely fashion it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution.\nMost of our PPAs do not include inflation-based price increases.\nIn general, our PPAs do not contain inflation-based price increase provisions. To the extent that the countries in which we conduct our business experience high rates of inflation, thereby increasing our operating costs in those countries, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset the effects of inflation, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nA material drop in the retail price of utility-generated electricity or electricity from other sources could increase competition for new PPAs, limiting our ability to attract new customers and adversely affecting our growth.\nDecreases in the retail prices of electricity supplied by utilities or other clean energy sources would harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and could harm our ability to sign new customers. The price of electricity from utilities could decrease for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe construction of a significant number of new power generation plants, including nuclear, coal, natural gas or renewable energy facilities;\n\u2022\nthe construction of additional electric transmission and distribution lines;\n\u2022\na reduction in the price of natural gas, including as a result of new drilling techniques or a relaxation of associated regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nenergy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption; and\n\u2022\nthe development of new clean energy technologies that provide less expensive energy.\nA shift in the timing of peak rates for utility-supplied electricity to a time of day when solar energy generation is less efficient could make solar and wind energy less competitive and reduce demand. If the retail price of energy available from utilities were to decrease, we would be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating new PPAs and therefore we may be unable to attract new customers and our growth would be limited.\nCertain of our PPAs and project-level financing arrangements include provisions that would permit the counterparty to terminate the contract or accelerate maturity in the event SunEdison ceases to control or own, directly or indirectly, a majority of our company.\nCertain of our PPAs and project-level financing arrangements contain change in control provisions that provide the counterparty with a termination right or the ability to accelerate maturity in the event of a change of control without the counterparty's consent. These provisions are triggered in the event SunEdison ceases to own, directly or indirectly, capital stock representing more than 50% of the voting power (which is equal to approximately 9% ownership) of all of our capital stock outstanding on such date, or, in some cases, if SunEdison ceases to be the majority owner, directly or indirectly, of the applicable project subsidiary. As a result, if SunEdison ceases to control, or in some cases, own a majority of TerraForm Power, the counterparties could terminate such contracts or accelerate the maturity of such financing arrangements. The termination of any of our PPAs or the acceleration of the maturity of any of our project-level financing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may not be able to replace expiring PPAs with contracts on similar terms. If we are unable to replace an expired distributed generation PPA with an acceptable new contract, we may be required to remove the solar or wind energy assets from the site or, alternatively, we may sell the assets to the site host.\nWe may not be able to replace an expiring PPA with a contract on equivalent terms and conditions, including at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. If we are unable to replace an expiring PPA with an acceptable new power generation facility revenue contract, the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. In the case of a distributed generation power generation facility that ceases operations, the PPA terms generally require that we remove the assets, including fixing or reimbursing the site owner for any damages caused by the assets or the removal of such assets. The cost of removing a significant number of distributed generation power generation facilities could be material. Alternatively, we may agree to sell the assets to the site owner, but the terms and conditions, including price, that we would receive in any sale, and the sale price may not be sufficient to replace the revenue previously generated by the power generation facility.\nWind plants located in Maine have experienced curtailment issues which may adversely affect revenues.\nThe Stetson and Rollins wind power plants have experienced significant curtailment starting in February 2012 due to a combination of construction on the Maine Power Reliability Project (\"MPRP\") a large transmission upgrade project affecting generation and transmission throughout Maine and adjoining areas, and transmission export limits at Keane Road. These power plants in the aggregate have had curtailment of approximately 58 GWh for each of 2014 and 2013, respectively, attributable in the aggregate to each of the MPRP and Keane Road. We currently expect the MPRP to be completed in 2015, although it may not be able to be completed on this timeline or at all. We are also currently pursuing several different solutions that may help to eliminate the Keane Road issue in 2015 or 2016. However, such solutions may not ameliorate or eliminate the Keane Road curtailment issues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow and our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock.\nThe growth of our business depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional, attractive clean energy power generation facilities from SunEdison and unaffiliated third parties at favorable prices.\nOur primary business strategy is to acquire clean energy power generation facilities that are operational from both SunEdison and third parties. We may also, in limited circumstances, acquire clean energy projects that are pre-operational. The following factors, among others, could affect the availability of attractive power generation facilities to grow our business:\n\u2022\ncompeting bids for a power generating facility, including from companies that may have substantially greater capital and other resources than we do;\n\u2022\nfewer third-party acquisition opportunities than we expect, which could result from, among other things, available power generation facilities having less desirable economic returns or higher risk profiles than we believe suitable for our business plan and investment strategy;\n\u2022\nSunEdison\u2019s failure to complete the development of the Call Right Projects or any of the other projects in its development pipeline, which could result from, among other things, permitting challenges, failure to procure the requisite financing, equipment or interconnection, or an inability to satisfy the conditions to effectiveness of project agreements such as PPAs, which could limit our acquisition opportunities under the Support Agreement or the Intercompany Agreement; and\n\u2022\nour failure to exercise our rights under the Support Agreement or the Intercompany Agreement to acquire assets from SunEdison.\nWe will not be able to achieve our target compound annual growth rate of CAFD per unit unless we are able to acquire additional clean energy power generation facilities at favorable prices.\nOur acquisition strategy exposes us to substantial risk.\nThe acquisition of power generation facilities is subject to substantial risk, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence (for which we may not be indemnified post-closing), the risk of over-paying for assets (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis), the ability to obtain or retain customers and, if the power generation facilities are in new markets, the risks of entering markets where we have limited experience. While we perform due diligence on prospective acquisitions, we may not be able to discover all potential operational deficiencies in such power generation facilities. In addition, our expectations for the operating performance of newly constructed power generation facilities and projects under construction are based on assumptions and estimates made without the benefit of operating history. However, the ability of these power generation facilities to meet our performance expectations is subject to the risks inherent in newly constructed power generation facilities and the construction of such facilities, including, but not limited to, degradation of equipment in excess of our expectations, system failures and outages. Future acquisitions may not perform as expected or the returns from such acquisitions may not support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. Furthermore, integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and may divert management\u2019s attention from our existing business concerns, disrupt our ongoing business or not be successfully integrated. As a result, the consummation of acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to effectively identify or consummate any future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, even if we consummate acquisitions on terms that we believe are favorable, such acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in cash available for distribution to holders of our Class A common stock.\nFuture acquisition opportunities for renewable energy power generation facilities are limited. While SunEdison has granted us the option to purchase the Call Right Projects and a right of first offer with respect to the ROFO Projects, we will compete with other companies for future acquisition opportunities. This may increase our cost of making acquisitions or cause us to refrain from making acquisitions at all. Some of our competitors are much larger than us with substantially greater resources. These companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than our resources permit.\nIn addition, if we are unable to reach agreement with SunEdison regarding the pricing of certain Call Right Projects, our acquisition opportunities may be more limited than we currently expect. If SunEdison\u2019s development of new projects slows, we also may have fewer opportunities to purchase projects from SunEdison. If we are unable to identify and consummate future acquisitions, it will impede our ability to execute our growth strategy and limit our ability to increase the amount of dividends paid to holders of our Class A common stock.\nEven if we consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to CAFD per unit, those acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in CAFD per unit as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control. Furthermore, if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and stockholders will generally not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.\nOur ability to grow and make acquisitions with cash on hand may be limited by our cash dividend policy.\nOur dividend policy is to cause Terra LLC to distribute approximately 85% of CAFD each quarter and to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities and, if applicable, borrowings under our New Revolver, to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. We may be precluded from pursuing otherwise attractive acquisitions if the projected short-term cash flow from the acquisition or investment is not adequate to service the capital raised to fund the acquisition or investment. As such, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business, including restricting our ability to pay cash dividends or react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur substantial debt could have important negative consequences on our financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock or to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into or receive payments under long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund operations or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our capital stock and the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain distributions to us, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in our credit facilities and other financing agreements;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, which may include borrowings under our New Revolver, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nOur New Revolver and Senior Notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to return capital to stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our inability to satisfy certain financial covenants could prevent us from paying cash dividends, and our failure to comply with those and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment and accelerate all such indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our project-level financing contain, and we expect project financings incurred or assumed on future projects we acquire to contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our project subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to us or otherwise engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. The project-level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions from the project entities to us unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of certain financial ratios. Our inability to satisfy certain financial covenants may prevent cash distributions by the particular project(s) to us and our failure to comply with those and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment and accelerate all such indebtedness. If we are unable to make distributions from our project-level subsidiaries, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock.\nIf our subsidiaries default on their obligations under their project-level indebtedness, this may constitute an event of default under our New Revolver, and we may be required to make payments to lenders to avoid such default or to prevent foreclosure on the collateral securing the project-level debt. If we are unable to or decide not to make such payments, we would lose certain of our solar and wind energy generation facilities upon foreclosure.\nOur subsidiaries incur, and we expect will in the future incur, various types of project-level indebtedness. Non-recourse debt is repayable solely from the applicable project\u2019s revenues and is secured by the project\u2019s physical assets, major contracts, cash accounts and, in many cases, our ownership interest in the project subsidiary. Limited recourse debt is debt where we have provided a limited guarantee, and recourse debt is debt where we have provided a full guarantee, which means if our subsidiaries default on these obligations, we will be liable directly to those lenders, although in the case of limited recourse debt only to the extent of our limited recourse obligations. To satisfy these obligations, we may be required to use amounts distributed by our other subsidiaries as well as other sources of available cash, reducing our cash available to execute our business plan and pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, if our subsidiaries default on their obligations under non-recourse financing agreements this may, under certain circumstances, result in an event of default under our New Revolver, allowing our lenders to foreclose on their security interests.\nEven if that is not the case, we may decide to make payments to prevent the lenders of these subsidiaries from foreclosing on the relevant collateral. Such a foreclosure could result in our losing our ownership interest in the subsidiary or in some or all of its assets. The loss of our ownership interest in one or more of our subsidiaries or some or all of their assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIf we are unable to renew letter of credit facilities our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow may be materially adversely affected.\nOur New Revolver includes a letter of credit facility to support project-level contractual obligations. This letter of credit facility will need to be renewed as of January 27, 2020, at which time we will need to satisfy applicable financial ratios and covenants. If we are unable to renew our letters of credit as expected or if we are only able to replace them with letters of credit under different facilities on less favorable terms, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Furthermore, the inability to provide letters of credit may constitute a default under certain project-level financing arrangements, restrict the ability of the project-level subsidiary to make distributions to us and/or reduce the amount of cash available at such subsidiary to make distributions to us.\nOur ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations may be limited.\nOur primary business strategy is to acquire clean energy power generation facilities that are operational from SunEdison and from unaffiliated third parties. We do not expect to have sufficient amounts of cash on hand to fund all such acquisition costs. As a result, we will need to arrange additional financing to finance a portion of such acquisitions. Our ability to arrange additional financing, either at the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level subsidiary, may be limited. Additional financing, including the costs of such financing, will be dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions;\n\u2022\ncredit availability from banks and other financial institutions;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in us, our partners, SunEdison, as our principal stockholder (on a combined voting basis), and manager under the Management Services Agreement, and the regional wholesale power markets;\n\u2022\nour financial performance and the financial performance of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of acceptable project credit ratings or credit quality, including maintenance of the legal and tax structure of the project-level subsidiary upon which the credit ratings may depend;\n\u2022\ncash flow; and\n\u2022\nprovisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining additional financing for these or other reasons. Furthermore, we may be unable to refinance or replace project-level financing arrangements or other credit facilities on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. Our failure, or the failure of any of our projects, to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur ability to generate revenue from certain utility-scale solar and wind energy power plants depends on having interconnection arrangements and services.\nIf the interconnection or transmission agreement of a clean energy power plant we own or acquire is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to replace it with an interconnection or transmission arrangement on terms as favorable as the existing arrangement, or at all, or we may experience significant delays or costs in to securing a replacement. If a transmission network to which one or more of our existing power plants or a power plant we acquire is connected experiences \u201cdown time,\u201d the affected project may lose revenue and be exposed to non-performance penalties and claims from its customers. The owners of the network will not usually compensate electricity generators for lost income due to down time. These factors could materially affect our ability to forecast operations and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets. In addition, certain of our operating facilities\u2019 generation of electricity may be physically or economically curtailed without compensation due to transmission limitations, reducing our revenues and impairing our ability to capitalize fully on a particular facility\u2019s generating potential. Such curtailments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Furthermore, economic congestion on the transmission grid (for instance, a positive price difference between the location where power is put on the grid by a project and the location where power is taken off the grid by the project\u2019s customer) in certain of the bulk power markets in which we operate may occur and we may be deemed responsible for those congestion costs. If we were liable for such congestion costs, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from traditional and renewable energy companies.\nThe solar and wind energy industries, and the broader renewable energy industry, are highly competitive and continually evolving, as market participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with large incumbent utilities and new market entrants. We believe that our primary competitors are the traditional incumbent utilities that supply energy to our potential customers under highly regulated rate and tariff structures. We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease with which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar generation facilities and wind power plants. If we cannot offer compelling value to our customers based on these factors, then our business will not grow. Traditional utilities generally have substantially greater financial, technical, operational and other resources than we do, and as a result may be able to devote more resources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Traditional utilities could also offer other value-added products or services that could help them to compete with us even if the cost of electricity they offer is higher than ours. In addition, the source of a majority of traditional utilities\u2019 electricity is non-solar and non-renewable, which may allow them to sell electricity more cheaply than electricity generated by our solar generation facilities, wind power plants, and other types of clean power generation facilities we acquire.\nWe also face risks that traditional utilities could change their volumetric-based (i.e., cents per kWh) rate and tariff structures to make distributed solar generation less economically attractive to their retail customers. Currently, net metering programs are utilized in 43 states to support the growth of distributed generation solar by requiring traditional utilities to reimburse certain of their retail customers for the excess power they generate at the level of the utilities\u2019 retail rates rather than the rates at which those utilities buy power at wholesale. In Arizona, the state has allowed its largest traditional utility, Arizona Public Service, to assess a surcharge on customers with solar generation facilities for their use of the utility\u2019s grid, based on the size of the customer\u2019s solar generation facility. This surcharge will reduce the economic returns for the excess electricity that the solar generation facilities produce. These types of changes or other types of changes that could reduce or eliminate the economic benefits of net-metering could be implemented in other states, which could significantly change the economic benefits of solar energy as perceived by traditional utilities\u2019 retail customers.\nWe also face competition in the energy efficiency evaluation and upgrades market and we expect to face competition in additional markets as we introduce new energy-related products and services. As the solar and wind industries grow and evolve, we will also face new competitors who are not currently in the market. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors will limit our growth and will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThere are a limited number of purchasers of utility-scale quantities of electricity, which exposes us and our utility-scale projects to additional risk.\nSince the transmission and distribution of electricity is either monopolized or highly concentrated in most jurisdictions, there are a limited number of possible purchasers for utility-scale quantities of electricity in a given geographic location, including transmission grid operators, state and investor-owned power companies, public utility districts and cooperatives. As a result, there is a concentrated pool of potential buyers for electricity generated by our plants and projects, which may restrict our ability to negotiate favorable terms under new PPAs and could impact our ability to find new customers for the electricity generated by our generation facilities should this become necessary. Furthermore, if the financial condition of these utilities and/or power purchasers deteriorated or the RPS programs, climate change programs or other regulations to which they are currently subject and that compel them to source renewable energy supplies change, demand for electricity produced by our plants could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, provisions in our power sale arrangements may provide for the curtailment of delivery of electricity for various operational reasons at no cost to the power purchaser, including to prevent damage to transmission systems and for system emergencies, force majeure, safety, reliability, maintenance and other operational reasons. Such curtailment would reduce revenues earned by us at no cost to the purchaser including, in addition to certain of the general types noted above, events in which energy purchases would result in costs greater than those which the purchaser would incur if it did not make such purchases but instead generated an equivalent amount of energy (provided that such curtailment is due to operational reasons and does not occur solely as a consequence of purchaser\u2019s filed avoided energy cost being lower than the agreement rates or purchasing less-expensive energy from another facility). In Hawaii, where several of our wind power plants are located, purchasers are required to take reasonable steps to minimize the number and duration of curtailment events, and that such curtailments will generally be made in reverse chronological order based upon Hawaii utility commission approval (which is beneficial to older projects such as our Kaheawa Wind Power I, or \"KWP I\"), such curtailments could still occur and reduce revenues to our Hawaii wind projects. If we cannot enter into power sale arrangements on terms favorable to us, or at all, or if the purchaser under our power sale arrangements were to exercise its curtailment or other rights to reduce purchases or payments under such arrangements, our revenues and our decisions regarding development of additional projects may be adversely affected.\nA significant deterioration in the financial performance of the retail industry could materially adversely affect our distributed generation business.\nThe financial performance of our distributed generation business depends in part upon the continued viability and financial stability of our customers in the retail industry, such as medium and large independent retailers and distribution centers. If the retail industry is materially and adversely affected by an economic downturn, increase in inflation or other factors, one or more of our largest customers could encounter financial difficulty, and possibly, bankruptcy. If one or more of our largest customers were to encounter financial difficulty or declare bankruptcy, they may reduce their PPA payments to us or stop them altogether.\nOur hedging activities may not adequately manage our exposure to commodity and financial risk, which could result in significant losses or require us to use cash collateral to meet margin requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, which could impair our ability to execute favorable financial hedges in the future.\nCertain of our wind assets are party to financial swaps or other hedging arrangements. We may also acquire additional assets with similar hedging arrangements in the future. Under the terms of the existing financial swaps, certain wind projects are not obligated to physically deliver or purchase electricity. Instead, they receive payments for specified quantities of electricity based on a fixed-price and are obligated to pay the counterparty the market price for the same quantities of electricity. These financial swaps cover quantities of electricity that we estimated are highly likely to be produced. As a result, gains or losses under the financial swaps are designed to be offset by decreases or increases in a project\u2019s revenues from spot sales of electricity in liquid markets. However, the actual amount of electricity a project generates from operations may be materially different from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including variable wind conditions and wind turbine availability. If a project does not generate the volume of electricity covered by the associated swap contract, we could incur significant losses if electricity prices in the market rise substantially above the fixed-price provided for in the swap. If a project generates more electricity than is contracted in the swap, the excess production will not be hedged and the related revenues will be exposed to market-price fluctuations.\nWe sometimes seek to sell forward a portion of our RECs or other environmental attributes to fix the revenues from those attributes and hedge against future declines in prices of RECs or other environmental attributes. If our projects do not\ngenerate the amount of electricity required to earn the RECs or other environmental attributes sold forward or if for any reason the electricity we generate does not produce RECs or other environmental attributes for a particular state, we may be required to make up the shortfall of RECs or other environmental attributes through purchases on the open market or make payments of liquidated damages. Further, current market conditions may limit our ability to hedge sufficient volumes of our anticipated RECs or other environmental attributes, leaving us exposed to the risk of falling prices for RECs or other environmental attributes. Future prices for RECs or other environmental attributes are also subject to the risk that regulatory changes will adversely affect prices.\nWhile we currently own only solar and wind energy generation facilities plants (and associated interconnecting transmission facilities), in the future we may decide to further expand our acquisition strategy to include other types of energy or transmission projects. To the extent that we expand our operations to include new business segments, our business operations may suffer from a lack of experience, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe have limited experience in energy generation operations. As a result of this lack of experience, we may be prone to errors if we expand our projects beyond such energy projects other than solar and wind. With no direct training or experience in these areas, our management may not be fully aware of the many specific requirements related to working in industries beyond solar energy generation. Additionally, we may be exposed to increased operating costs, unforeseen liabilities or risks, and regulatory and environmental concerns associated with entering new sectors of the power generation industry, which could have an adverse impact on our business as well as place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to more established non-solar energy market participants. Our operations, earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to our management\u2019s lack of experience in these industries.\nOperation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.\nThe ongoing operation of our facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or performance below expected levels of output or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events, among other things. Operation of our facilities also involves risks that we will be unable to transport our product to our customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business. Unplanned outages typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues as a result of generating and selling less power or require us to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy our forward power sales obligations.\nOur inability to efficiently operate our solar energy assets and our wind assets, manage capital expenditures and costs and generate earnings and cash flow from our asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover our lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments should we experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.\nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in our operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate but we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Furthermore, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, caps, exclusions and other limitations. A loss for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in laws or regulations, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or other legal requirements.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility or, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.\nWith the exception of Mt. Signal, Regulus, and certain wind projects, all of the U.S. Projects in our portfolio are QFs as defined under PURPA. Depending upon the power production capacity of the project in question, our QFs and their immediate project company owners may be entitled to various exemptions from ratemaking and certain other regulatory provisions of the FPA, from the books and records access provisions of PUHCA, and from state organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities.\nEach of the Mt. Signal ProjectCo, the Regulus ProjectCo and the wind project company owners are an EWG which exempts it and us (for purposes of our ownership of each such company) from the federal books and access provisions of PUHCA. The projects owned by certain of the EWG ProjectCos are QFs and in one instance the EWG ProjectCo that owns such projects may receive exemptions from regulation as a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under certain provisions of the FPA. However, the Mt. Signal ProjectCo, the Regulus ProjectCo and the EWG Project Cos are subject to regulation for most purposes as \u201cpublic utilities\u201d under the FPA, including regulation of their rates and their issuances of securities. Each of the Mt. Signal ProjectCo, the Regulus ProjectCo and the EWG ProjectCos has obtained \u201cmarket-based rate authorization\u201d and associated blanket authorizations and waivers from FERC under the FPA, which allows it to sell electric energy, capacity and ancillary services at wholesale at negotiated, market-based rates, instead of cost-of-service rates, as well as waivers of, and blanket authorizations under, certain FERC regulations that are commonly granted to market based rate sellers, including blanket authorizations to issue securities.\nThe failure of the project company owners of our QFs to maintain available exemptions under PURPA may result in their becoming subject to significant additional regulatory requirements. In addition, the failure of the Mt. Signal ProjectCo, the Regulus ProjectCo, the EWG ProjectCos, or other project company owners of our QFs to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in the imposition of penalties as discussed further in Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.\nIn particular, the Mt. Signal ProjectCo, the Regulus ProjectCo, the EWG ProjectCos, and any of the other owners of our project companies that obtain market-based rate authority from FERC under the FPA are or will be subject to certain market behavior rules as established and enforced by FERC, and if they are determined to have violated those rules, will be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation, penalties, and suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority. If such entities were to lose their market-based rate authority, they would be required to obtain FERC\u2019s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule for wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services and could become subject to significant accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on FERC-regulated public utilities with cost-based rate schedules.\nSubstantially all of our assets are also subject to the rules and regulations applicable to power generators generally, in particular the reliability standards of NERC or similar standards in Canada, the United Kingdom and Chile. If we fail to comply with these mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, increased compliance obligations and disconnection from the grid.\nThe regulatory environment for electric generation in the United States has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting the wholesale and retail power markets and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and demand response resources. These changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on our business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, as well as made proposals to re-regulate the markets or require divestiture of electric generation assets by asset owners or operators to reduce their market share. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, discontinued or delayed, our business prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nLaws, governmental regulations and policies supporting renewable energy, and specifically solar and wind energy (including tax incentives), could change at any time, including as a result of new political leadership, and such changes may materially adversely affect our business and our growth strategy.\nRenewable generation assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives. In the United States, these incentives include ITCs, PTCs, loan guarantees, RPS programs and modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation. For example, the IRS Code provides an ITC of 30% of the cost-basis of an eligible resource, including solar energy facilities placed in service prior to the end of 2016, which percentage is currently scheduled to be reduced to 10% for solar generation facilities placed in service after December 31, 2016. The U.S. Congress could reduce the ITC to below 30% prior to the end of 2016, reduce the ITC to below 10% for periods after 2016 or replace the expected 10% ITC with an untested production tax credit of an unknown amount. Any reduction in the ITC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. PTCs, which are federal income tax credits related to the quantity of renewable energy produced and sold during a taxable year, or ITCs in lieu of PTCs, are available only for wind power plants that began construction on or prior to December 31, 2014. PTCs and accelerated tax depreciation benefits generated by operating projects can be monetized by entering into tax equity financing agreements with investors that can utilize the tax benefits, which have been a key financing tool for wind power plants. The growth of our wind energy business may be dependent on the U.S. Congress further extending the expiration date of, renewing or replacing PTCs, without which the market for tax equity financing for wind projects would likely cease to exist. Recent legislative efforts to extend or renew PTCs have failed, and we cannot assure that current or any subsequent efforts to further extend, renew or replace PTCs will be successful. Any failure to extend, renew or replace PTCs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nMany U.S. states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy. If the RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, it could lead to fewer future power contracts or lead to lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth prospects. Such material adverse effects may result from decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs and/or difficulty obtaining financing.\nRenewable energy sources in Canada benefit from federal and provincial incentives, such as RPS programs, accelerated cost recovery deductions allowed for tax purposes, the availability of off-take agreements through RPS and the Ontario FIT program, and other commercially oriented incentives. Renewable energy sources in the United Kingdom benefit from renewable obligation certificates, climate change levy exemption certificates, embedded benefits and contracts for difference. Renewable energy sources in Chile benefit from an RPS program. Any adverse change to, or the elimination of, these incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business and our future growth prospects.\nIf any of the laws or governmental regulations or policies that support renewable energy, including solar energy, change, or if we are subject to new and burdensome laws or regulations, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe have a limited operating history and as a result we may not operate on a profitable basis.\nWe have a relatively new portfolio of assets, including several projects that have only recently commenced operations or that we expect will commence operations in the near future, and a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operation, particularly in a rapidly evolving industry such as ours. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing the risks we may encounter, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of power generation facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output.\nOur facilities may require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, and any decreased operational or management performance, could reduce our facilities\u2019 generating capacity below expected levels, reducing our revenues and jeopardizing our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock at forecasted levels or at all. Degradation of the performance of our solar generation facilities and wind power plants provided for in the related PPAs may also reduce our revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing our facilities may also reduce profitability.\nWe may also choose to refurbish or upgrade our facilities based on our assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, timing, available financing and future power prices. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nMoreover, spare parts for wind turbines and solar facilities and key pieces of equipment may be hard to acquire or unavailable to us. Sources of some significant spare parts and other equipment are located outside of North America. If we were to experience a shortage of or inability to acquire critical spare parts we could incur significant delays in returning facilities to full operation, which could negatively impact our business financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur KWP II project is required under its PPA to install and maintain a battery energy storage system, the manufacturer of which is in bankruptcy and no longer supplies batteries to any customers. If we are unable to source acceptable replacement batteries, this could result in a default under, or termination of, KWP II\u2019s PPA.\nOur Kaheawa Wind Power II (\"KWP II\") project is required under its PPA to install and maintain a battery energy storage system (\u201cBESS\u201d). The manufacturer of the BESS is in bankruptcy and is no longer providing replacement batteries and other components for the BESS. We are sourcing replacement batteries from a new supplier, but such replacement batteries may not be sufficient for the system to operate as designed or may not be available in the quantities or at an economical price. Our Kahuku project had a similar BESS that was required to be operated under its PPA, but the BESS was destroyed in a fire. The project installed a D-Var system as a replacement for the BESS under the Kahuku project PPA, which has been operating as designed. If the BESS system at KWP II was damaged or could no longer operate, a D-Var could not be used at the KWP II project as a replacement to the BESS due to technical constraints, and another replacement system may not be compatible or available at a price that would allow the project to operate economically. Failure to maintain the battery system constitutes a default under KWP II\u2019s PPA and could result in the termination of KWP II\u2019s PPA, which could negatively impact our business financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nCertain of the wind projects use equipment originally produced and supplied by Clipper Windpower, LLC, or its affiliates (\"Clipper\") which no longer manufactures, warrants or services the wind turbine it produced. If Clipper equipment experiences defects in the future, we may not be able to obtain replacement components and will need to self-fund the correction or replacement of such equipment.\nThe Cohocton, Kahuku, Sheffield, and Steel Winds I and II projects operate ninety-two Liberty turbines (230 MW) supplied by Clipper. Since initial deployment, Clipper has announced and remediated various defects affecting the Liberty turbines deployed by us and by other customers, which resulted in prolonged downtime for turbines at various projects. Moreover, Clipper no longer manufactures, warrants or services the Liberty turbines or other wind equipment it produced.\nBeginning in 2012, we engaged in a number of litigation and arbitration proceedings with Clipper concerning the performance of the Liberty turbines. On February 12, 2013, all such disputes were settled pursuant to a Settlement, Release and Operation and Maintenance (\"O&M\") Transition Agreement among certain of our and Clipper entities (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we have, among other things, released Clipper of all of its warranty obligations with respect to the equipment supplied by Clipper, and the obligations under the related operation and maintenance contracts, and we have been granted by Clipper a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license to make, improve and modify any Clipper-supplied equipment and to create derivative works from such equipment.\nAs a result, if Clipper equipment experiences defects in the future, we will not have the benefit of a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on such original equipment, may not be able to obtain replacement components and will need to self-fund the correction or replacement of such equipment, which could negatively impact our business financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nSunEdison and other developers of solar energy projects and other clean energy projects depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels, inverters, module turbines, towers and other system components and turbines and other equipment associated with wind energy facilities. Any shortage, delay or component price change from these suppliers could result in construction or installation delays, which could affect the number of projects we are able to acquire in the future.\nThere have also been periods of industry-wide shortage of key components, including solar panels and wind turbines, in times of rapid industry growth. The manufacturing infrastructure for some of these components has a long lead time, requires significant capital investment and relies on the continued availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components. In addition, the United States government has imposed tariffs on solar cells manufactured in China. Based on determinations by the United States government, the applicable anti-dumping tariff rates\nrange from approximately 8% to 239%. To the extent that United States market participants experience harm from Chinese pricing practices, an additional tariff of approximately 15%-16% will be applied. If SunEdison or other unaffiliated third parties purchase solar panels containing cells manufactured in China, our purchase price for projects would reflect the tariff penalties mentioned above. A shortage of key commodity materials could also lead to a reduction in the number of projects that we may have the opportunity to acquire in the future, or delay or increase the costs of acquisitions.\nWe may incur unexpected expenses if the suppliers of components in our energy projects default in their warranty obligations.\nThe solar panels, inverters, modules and other system components utilized in our solar energy projects are generally covered by manufacturers\u2019 warranties, which typically range from 5 to 20 years. When purchasing wind turbines, the purchaser will enter into warranty agreements with the manufacturer which typically expire within two to five years after the turbine delivery date. In the event any such components fail to operate as required, we may be able to make a claim against the applicable warranty to cover all or a portion of the expense associated with the faulty component. However, these suppliers could cease operations and no longer honor the warranties, which would leave us to cover the expense associated with the faulty component. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially adversely affected if we cannot make claims under warranties covering our projects.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.\nOur assets are subject to numerous and significant federal, state, local and foreign laws, and other requirements governing or relating to the the environment. Our facilities could experience incidents, malfunctions and other unplanned events, such as spills of hazardous materials that may result in personal injury, penalties and property damage. In addition, certain environmental laws may result in liability, regardless of fault, concerning contamination at a range of properties, including properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us and properties where we disposed of, or arranged for disposal of, waste and other hazardous materials. As such, the operation of our facilities carries an inherent risk of environmental liabilities, and may result in our involvement from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters. While we have implemented environmental management programs designed to continually improve environmental, health and safety performance, we cannot assure you that such liabilities including significant required capital expenditures, as well as the costs for complying with environmental laws and regulations, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nHarming of protected species can result in curtailment of wind project operations.\nThe operation of energy projects can adversely affect endangered, threatened or otherwise protected animal species. Wind projects, in particular, involve a risk that protected species will be harmed, as the turbine blades travel at a high rate of speed and may strike flying animals (birds or bats) that happen to travel into the path of spinning blades.\nOur wind power plants are known to strike and kill bats and birds, and occasionally strike and kill endangered or protected species, including protected golden or bald eagles. As a result, we will attempt to observe all industry guidelines and governmentally recommended best practices to avoid harm to protected species, such as avoiding structures with perches, avoiding guy wires that may kill birds or bats in flight, or avoiding lighting that may attract protected species at night. In addition, we will attempt to reduce the attractiveness of a site to predatory birds by site maintenance (e.g., by mowing or removal of animal and bird carcasses).\nWhere possible, we will obtain permits for incidental take of protected species. We hold such permits for some of our wind projects, particularly in Hawaii, where several species are endangered and protected by law. We are currently in discussions with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (\"USF&WS\") about obtaining incidental take permits for bald and golden eagles at locations with low to moderate risk of such events. We are also discussing with USF&WS amending the incidental take permits for certain wind projects in Hawaii, where observed endangered species mortality has exceeded prior estimates and may exceed permit limits on such takings.\nExcessive taking of protected species can result in requirements to implement mitigation strategies, including curtailment of operations. Our wind projects in Hawaii, several of which hold incidental take permits to authorize the incidental taking of small numbers of protected species, are subject to curtailment (i.e., reduction in operations) if excessive taking of protected species is detected through monitoring. At some of the projects in Hawaii, curtailment has been implemented, but not at levels that materially reduce electricity generation or revenues. Such curtailments (to protect bats) have reduced nighttime operation and limited operation to times when wind speeds are high enough to prevent bats from flying into a project\u2019s blades. Based on continuing concerns about species other than bats, however, additional curtailments are possible at those locations.\nWe cannot guarantee that such curtailments will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks that are beyond our control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disasters, hostile cyber intrusions, theft or other catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur solar generation facilities, wind power plants, or those that we otherwise acquire in the future, may be targets of terrorist activities that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of the facilities\u2019 ability to generate electricity. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the related distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as create significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage.\nFurthermore, certain of our projects are located in active earthquake zones. The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, drought, flood or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages, affecting us could cause a significant interruption in our business, damage or destroy our facilities or those of our suppliers or the manufacturing equipment or inventory of our suppliers.\nAdditionally, certain of our power generation assets and equipment are at risk for theft and damage. For example, we are at risk for copper wire theft, especially at our international projects, due to an increased demand for copper in the United States and internationally. Theft of copper wire or solar panels can cause significant disruption to our operations for a period of months and can lead to operating losses at those locations. Damage to wind turbine equipment may also occur, either through natural events such as lightning strikes that damage blades or inground electrical systems used to collect electricity from turbines, or through vandalism, such as gunshots into towers or other generating equipment. Such damage can cause disruption of operations for unspecified periods which may lead to operating losses at those locations.\nAny such terrorist acts, environmental repercussions or disruptions, natural disasters or theft incidents could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction, remediation or replacement costs, beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur use and enjoyment of real property rights for our projects may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to us.\nSolar and wind projects generally are and are likely to be located on land occupied by the project pursuant to long-term easements and leases. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements and leases may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement and lease rights of third parties (such as leases of oil or mineral rights) that were created prior to the project\u2019s easements and leases. As a result, the project\u2019s rights under these easements or leases may be subject, and subordinate, to the rights of those third parties. We perform title searches and obtain title insurance to protect ourselves against these risks. Such measures may, however, be inadequate to protect us against all risk of loss of our rights to use the land on which the wind projects are located, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent or future litigation or administrative proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have and continue to be involved in legal proceedings, administrative proceedings, claims and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business of operating our solar generation facilities and wind power plants. In. Individuals and interest groups may sue to challenge the issuance of a permit for a solar generation facility or wind power plant. In addition, a project may be subject to legal proceedings or claims contesting the operation of the wind projects. Unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to these proceedings, such as judgments for monetary damages, injunctions or denial or revocation of permits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, settlement of claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational operations subject us to political and economic uncertainties.\nOur portfolio consists of solar and wind projects located in the United States and its unincorporated territories, Canada, the United Kingdom and Chile. In addition, since solar energy generation and other forms of clean energy are in the early stages of development and the industry is evolving rapidly, we could decide to expand into other international markets. As\na result, our activities are and will be subject to significant political and economic uncertainties that may adversely affect our operating and financial performance. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe risk of a change in renewable power pricing policies, possibly with retroactive effect;\n\u2022\nmeasures restricting the ability of our facilities to access the grid to deliver electricity at certain times or at all;\n\u2022\nthe macroeconomic climate and levels of energy consumption in the countries where we have operations;\n\u2022\nthe comparative cost of other sources of energy;\n\u2022\nchanges in taxation policies and/or the regulatory environment in the countries in which we have operations, including reductions to renewable power incentive programs;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of currency controls and foreign exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nhigh rates of inflation;\n\u2022\nprotectionist and other adverse public policies, including local content requirements, import/export tariffs, increased regulations or capital investment requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges to land use regulations and permitting requirements;\n\u2022\nrisk of nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises and land;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in timely identifying, attracting and retaining qualified technical and other personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulty competing against competitors who may have greater financial resources and/or a more effective or established localized business presence;\n\u2022\ndifficulties with, and extra-normal costs of, recruiting and retaining local individuals skilled in international business operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable terms; and\n\u2022\nbeing subject to the jurisdiction of courts other than those of the United States, which courts may be less favorable to us.\nThese uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nChanges in foreign withholding taxes could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct a portion of our operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and Chile, and may in the future expand our business into other foreign countries. We are subject to risks that foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income. Currently, distributions of earnings and other payments, including interest, to us from our foreign projects could constitute ordinary dividend income taxable to the extent of our earnings and profits, which may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the jurisdiction in which such entities are formed or operating. Any such withholding taxes will reduce the amount of after-tax cash we can receive. If those withholding taxes are increased, the amount of after-tax cash we receive will be further reduced.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because certain of our solar energy projects are located in foreign countries.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues and incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Changes in economic or political conditions in any of the countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement, new currency or exchange controls or other restrictions being imposed on our operations or expropriation. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate revenue or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into U.S. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those revenues or earnings. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our profitability. Our debt service requirements are primarily in U.S. dollars even though a percentage of our cash flow is generated in other foreign currencies and therefore significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on debts denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever we or one of our projects enter into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and positive impacts on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly as a result of changes in the value of the Canadian dollar, the British pound and other currencies. We expect that our revenues denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies will continue to increase in future periods.\nAdditionally, although a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currency, we will pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock in U.S. dollars. The amount of U.S. dollar denominated dividends paid to our holders of our Class A common stock will therefore be exposed to currency exchange rate risk. Although we intend to enter into hedging arrangements to help mitigate some of this exchange rate risk, these arrangements may not be sufficient. Changes in the foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and may adversely affect the amount of cash dividends paid by us to holders of our Class A common stock.\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the United States government and various non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nDoing business in multiple countries requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the United States government and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to us, our subsidiaries, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and those of SunEdison, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our non-U.S. operations are subject to United States and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\"FCPA\"). The FCPA prohibits United States companies and their officers, directors, employees and agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. As a result, business dealings between our or SunEdison\u2019s employees and any such foreign official could expose our company to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws even if such business practices may be customary or are not otherwise prohibited between our company and a private third party. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable United States and non-U.S. laws and regulations; however, we cannot assure you that these policies and procedures will completely eliminate the risk of a violation of these legal requirements, and any such violation (inadvertent or otherwise) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the future, we may acquire certain assets in which we have limited control over management decisions and our interests in such assets may be subject to transfer or other related restrictions.\nWe may seek to acquire additional assets in the future in which we own less than a majority of the related interests in the assets. In these investments, we will seek to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of assets in which we own less than a majority of the interests by negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we may not always succeed in such negotiations, and we may be dependent on our co-venturers to operate such assets. Our co-venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these assets optimally. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us and our stockholders, on the one hand, and our co-venturers, on the other hand, where our co-venturers\u2019 business interests are inconsistent with our interests and those of our stockholders. Further, disagreements or disputes between us and our co-venturers could result in litigation, which could increase our expenses and potentially limit the time and effort our officers and directors are able to devote to our business.\nThe approval of co-venturers also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from assets or to sell, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise convey our interest in such assets, or for us to acquire SunEdison\u2019s interests in such co-ventures as an initial matter. Alternatively, our co-venturers may have rights of first refusal or rights of first offer in the event of a proposed sale or transfer of our interests in such assets. These restrictions may limit the price or interest level for our interests in such assets, in the event we want to sell such interests.\nWe may not be able to renew our sale-leasebacks on similar terms. If we are unable to renew a sale-leaseback on acceptable terms we may be required to remove the solar energy assets from the project site subject to the sale-leaseback transaction or, alternatively, we may be required to purchase the solar energy assets from the lessor at unfavorable terms.\nProvided the lessee is not in default, customary end of lease term provisions for sale-leaseback transactions obligate the lessee to (i) renew the sale-leaseback assets at fair market value, (ii) purchase the solar energy assets at fair market value or (iii) return the solar energy assets to the lessor. The cost of acquiring or removing a significant number of solar energy assets\ncould be material. Further, we may not be successful in obtaining the additional financing necessary to purchase such solar energy assets from the lessor. Failure to renew our sale-leaseback transactions as they expire may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe accounting treatment for many aspects of our solar energy business, and the wind energy business, is complex and any changes to the accounting interpretations or accounting rules governing our solar energy business or wind energy business could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. GAAP reported results of operations and financial results.\nThe accounting treatment for many aspects of our solar energy business and wind energy business is complex, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the accounting treatment applicable to our solar and wind energy businesses. In particular, any changes to the accounting rules regarding the following matters may require us to change the manner in which we operate and finance our business:\n\u2022\nrevenue recognition and related timing;\n\u2022\nintra-company contracts;\n\u2022\noperation and maintenance contracts;\n\u2022\njoint venture accounting, including the consolidation of joint venture entities and the inclusion or exclusion of their assets and liabilities on our balance sheet;\n\u2022\nlong-term vendor agreements; and\n\u2022\nforeign holding company tax treatment.\nNegative public or community response to energy projects could adversely affect construction of our projects.\nNegative public or community response to solar, wind and other clean energy projects, could adversely affect our ability to acquire and operate our projects. Our experience is that such opposition subsides over time after projects are completed and are operating, but there are cases where opposition, disputes and even litigation continue into the operating period and could lead to curtailment of a project or other project modifications.\nThe seasonality of our operations may affect our liquidity.\nWe will need to maintain sufficient financial liquidity to absorb the impact of seasonal variations in energy production or other significant events. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities, the cash retained by us for working capital purposes out of the gross proceeds of the two equity offerings and Senior Notes offering we made in January 2015 as well as our borrowing capacity under our New Revolver. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly for various reasons, mostly related to economic incentives and weather patterns.\nFor instance, the amount of electricity our solar generation facilities produce is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. Because shorter daylight hours in winter months results in less irradiation, the generation of particular assets will vary depending on the season. The electricity produced and revenues generated by a wind power plant depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for projects vary significantly from period to period depending on the windiness during the periods in question. Additionally, to the extent more of our power generation assets are located in the northern or southern hemisphere, overall generation of our entire asset portfolio could be impacted by seasonality. Further, time-of-day pricing factors vary seasonally which contributes to variability of revenues. We expect our portfolio of power generation assets to generate the lowest amount of electricity during the fourth quarter. However, we expect aggregate seasonal variability to decrease if geographic diversity of our portfolio between the northern and southern hemisphere increases.\nIn addition, in Canada, the construction of solar generation facilities may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year, largely due to periodic reductions of the applicable minimum FIT and the fact that the coldest winter months are January through March, which impacts the amount of construction that occurs. In the United States, customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. If we fail to adequately manage the fluctuations in the timing of our projects, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected. The seasonality of our energy production may create increased demands on our working capital reserves and borrowing capacity under our New Revolver during periods where cash generated from operating activities are lower. In the event that our working capital reserves and borrowing capacity under our New Revolver are insufficient to meet our financial requirements, or in the event that the restrictive covenants in our New Revolver restrict our access to such facilities, we may require additional equity or debt financing to maintain our solvency. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available when required or available on commercially favorable terms or on terms that are otherwise satisfactory to us, in which event our financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nThe production of wind energy depends heavily on suitable wind conditions. If wind conditions are unfavorable or below our estimates, our electricity production, and therefore our revenue, may be substantially below our expectations.\nThe electricity produced and revenues generated by a wind power plant depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for projects vary significantly from period to period depending on the windiness during the periods in question. We have based our decisions about which sites to develop in part on the findings of long-term wind and other meteorological studies conducted in the proposed area, which measure the wind\u2019s speed, prevailing direction and seasonal variations. Actual wind conditions at these sites, however, may not conform to the measured data in these studies and may be affected by variations in weather patterns, including any potential impact of climate change. Therefore, the electricity generated by our projects may not meet our anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of the turbines located there, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In some quarters the wind resources at our operating projects, while within the range of our long-term estimates, have varied from the averages we expected. If the wind resources at a project are below the average level we expect, our rate of return for the project would be below our expectations and we would be adversely affected. Projections of wind resources also rely upon assumptions about turbine placement, interference between turbines and the effects of vegetation, land use and terrain, which involve uncertainty and require us to exercise considerable judgment. We or our consultants may make mistakes in conducting these wind and other meteorological studies. Any of these factors could cause our development sites to have less wind potential than we expected, or to cause us develop our sites in ways that do not optimize their potential, which could cause the return on our investment in these projects to be lower than expected.\nIf our wind energy assessments turn out to be wrong, our business could suffer a number of material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nour energy production and sales may be significantly lower than we predict;\n\u2022\nour hedging arrangements may be ineffective or more costly;\n\u2022\nwe may not produce sufficient energy to meet our commitments to sell electricity or RECs and, as a result, we may have to buy electricity or RECs on the open market to cover our obligations or pay damages; and\n\u2022\nour projects may not generate sufficient cash flow to make payments of principal and interest as they become due on the notes and our project-related debt, and we or First Wind Holdings may have difficulty obtaining financing for future projects.\nChanges in tax laws may limit the current benefits of solar and wind energy investment.\nWe face risks related to potential changes in tax laws that may limit the current benefits of solar and wind energy investment. As discussed in Item 1. Business - Government Incentives, government incentives provide significant support for renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and a decrease in these tax benefits could increase the costs of investment in solar and wind energy. For example, in 2013 the Czech Republic and Spain announced retroactive taxes for solar energy producers. If these types of changes are enacted in other countries as well, the costs of solar energy may increase.\nAdditionally, we receive grant payments for specified energy property from the U.S. Department of the Treasury in lieu of tax credits pursuant to Section 1603 Grant. As a condition to claiming a Section 1063 Grant, we are required to maintain compliance with the terms of the Section 1603 program for a period of five years beginning on the date the eligible solar and wind energy property is placed in service. Failure to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 1603 could result in recapture of all or a part of the amounts received under a Section 1603 Grant, plus interest.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company\" and may elect in future SEC filings to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements, which could make the Company's Class A common stock less attractive to stockholders.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the \u201cJOBS Act.\u201d For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various public company reporting requirements. These exemptions include, but are not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements, and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduce disclosure obligations regarding financial statements and executive compensation. In addition, Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to\n\"opt in\" to such extended transition period election under Section 107(b). Therefore we are electing to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may choose not to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result of such election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies.\nWe could be an emerging growth company for up to five years after the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which such fifth anniversary will occur in 2019. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a \"large accelerated filer,\" our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements and executive compensation and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to holders of our Class A common stock may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which they hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of any choice we make to reduce disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and the price for our Class A common stock may be more volatile.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete strategic acquisitions or affect combinations.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the \"Investment Company Act,\" our business would be subject to applicable restrictions under the Investment Company Act, which could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated.\nWe believe our company is not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business, and we intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.\nAs a public company, we incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that have not been reflected in our Predecessor's historical financial statements. In addition, rules implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Select Market have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. These rules and regulations result in our incurring legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nOur legal, accounting and other expenses relating to being a publicly traded company will be paid by SunEdison under the Management Services Agreement without a fee for 2014, and with the relevant service fees for 2015, 2016 and 2017 capped at $4.0 million, $7.0 million, and $9.0 million, respectively. The Management Services Agreement does not have a fixed term, but may be terminated by us in certain circumstances, including upon the earlier to occur of (i) the five-year anniversary of the date of the agreement and (ii) the end of any 12-month period ending on the last day of a calendar quarter during which we generated cash available for distribution in excess of $350 million. Following the termination of the Management Services Agreement we will be required to pay for these expenses directly.\nOur failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a public company could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nPrior to completion of our IPO on July 23, 2014, we had not operated as a public company and had not had to independently comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are required to meet these standards in the course of preparing our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year. Additionally, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are currently in the process of reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting, but we are not currently in compliance with, and we cannot be certain when we will be able to implement the requirements of Section 404(a). We may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm after we cease to be an emerging growth company. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls after we cease to be an emerging growth company, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. The existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause shareholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and share price.\nRisks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison\nSunEdison is our controlling stockholder and exercises substantial influence over TerraForm Power, and we are highly dependent on SunEdison.\nSunEdison beneficially owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock. Each share of our outstanding Class B common stock entitles SunEdison to 10 votes on all matters presented to our stockholders. As a result of its ownership of our Class B common stock, SunEdison possesses approximately 91% of the combined voting power of our stockholders even though SunEdison only owns 50% of total shares outstanding (inclusive of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class B1 common stock). SunEdison has expressed its intention to maintain a controlling interest in us going forward. As a result of this ownership, SunEdison has a substantial influence on our affairs and its voting power will constitute a large percentage of any quorum of our stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of our stockholders. Such matters include the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of mergers or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. In addition, SunEdison, for so long as it and its controlled affiliates possess a majority of the combined voting power, has the power to appoint all of our directors. SunEdison also has a right to specifically designate up to two additional directors to our board of directors until such time as SunEdison and its controlled affiliates cease to own shares representing a majority voting power in us. SunEdison may cause corporate actions to be taken even if its interests conflict with the interests of our other stockholders (including holders of our Class A common stock).\nFurthermore, we depend on the management and administration services provided by or under the direction of SunEdison under the Management Services Agreement. Other than personnel designated as dedicated to us, SunEdison\npersonnel and support staff that provide services to us under the Management Services Agreement are not required to, and we do not expect that they will, have as their primary responsibility the management and administration of our business or act exclusively for us. Under the Management Services Agreement, SunEdison has the discretion to determine which of its employees, other than the designated TerraForm Power personnel, will perform assignments required to be provided to us under the Management Services Agreement. Any failure to effectively manage our operations or to implement our strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The Management Services Agreement will continue in perpetuity, until terminated in accordance with its terms. The non-compete provisions of the Management Services Agreement will survive termination indefinitely. In addition, in connection with its financing activities, SunEdison has pursued and may pursue various transactions that may impact us or the value of our Class A common stock, including pledges of our common stock held by SunEdison or its affiliates to secure debt or other obligations. SunEdison has pledged the shares of Class B common stock that it owns to its lenders under its credit facilities. If the lenders foreclose on these shares, the market price of our shares of Class A common stock could be materially adversely affected.\" In addition, SunEdison may enter into agreements with financing entities for the construction and operation of Class Right Projects that could include obligations by us to purchase Call Right Projects in certain limited circumstances.\nThe Support Agreement provides us the option to purchase additional solar projects that have Projected FTM CAFD of at least $75.0 million from the completion of our IPO through the end of 2015 and $100.0 million during 2016, representing aggregate additional Projected FTM CAFD of $175.0 million. The Support Agreement also provides us a right of first offer with respect to the ROFO Projects. Additionally, we depend upon SunEdison for the provision of management and administration services at all of our facilities. Any failure by SunEdison to perform its requirements under these arrangements or the failure by us to identify and contract with replacement service providers, if required, could adversely affect the operation of our facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe departure of some or all of SunEdison\u2019s employees, particularly executive officers or key employees, could prevent us from achieving our objectives.\nOur growth strategy relies on our and SunEdison\u2019s executive officers and key employees for their strategic guidance and expertise in the selection of projects that we may acquire in the future. Because the solar energy industry and wind energy industry are relatively new, there is a scarcity of experienced executives and employees in these industries and the clean energy industry more widely. Our future success will depend on the continued service of these individuals. SunEdison has experienced departures of key professionals and personnel in the past and may do so in the future, and we cannot predict the impact that any such departures will have on our ability to achieve our objectives. The departure of a significant number of SunEdison\u2019s professionals or a material portion of its employees who perform services for us or on our behalf, or the failure to appoint qualified or effective successors in the event of such departures, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our objectives. The Management Services Agreement does not require SunEdison to maintain the employment of any of its professionals or, except with respect to the dedicated TerraForm Power personnel, to cause any particular professional to provide services to us or on our behalf and SunEdison may terminate the employment of any professional.\nOur organizational and ownership structure may create significant conflicts of interest that may be resolved in a manner that is not in our best interests or the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock and that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur organizational and ownership structure involves a number of relationships that may give rise to certain conflicts of interest between us and holders of our Class A common stock, on the one hand, and SunEdison, on the other hand. We have entered into the Management Services Agreement with SunEdison. Our executive officers are employees of SunEdison and certain of them will continue to have equity interests in SunEdison and, accordingly, the benefit to SunEdison from a transaction between us and SunEdison will proportionately inure to their benefit as holders of equity interests in SunEdison. SunEdison is a related party under the applicable securities laws governing related party transactions and may have interests which differ from our interests or those of holders of our Class A common stock, including with respect to the types of acquisitions made, the timing and amount of dividends by TerraForm Power, the reinvestment of returns generated by our operations, the use of leverage when making acquisitions and the appointment of outside advisors and service providers. Any material transaction between us and SunEdison (including the acquisition of the Call Right Projects and any ROFO Projects) are subject to our related party transaction policy, which will require prior approval of such transaction by our Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee. Those of our executive officers who continue to have economic interests in SunEdison may be conflicted when advising our Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee or otherwise participating in the negotiation or approval of such transactions. These executive officers have significant project- and industry-specific expertise that could prove beneficial to our Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee\u2019s decision-making process and the absence of such strategic guidance could have a material adverse effect on the Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee\u2019s ability to evaluate any such transaction. Furthermore, the creation of our Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee and our\nrelated party transaction approval policy may not insulate us from derivative claims related to related party transactions and the conflicts of interest described in this risk factor. Regardless of the merits of such claims, we may be required to expend significant management time and financial resources in the defense thereof. Additionally, to the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe holder or holders of our IDRs may elect to cause Terra LLC to issue Class B1 units to it or them in connection with a resetting of target distribution levels related to the IDRs, without the approval of our Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee or the holders of Terra LLC\u2019s units, us as manager of Terra LLC, or our board of directors (or any committee thereof). This could result in lower distributions to holders of our Class A common stock.\nThe holder or holders of a majority of the IDRs (currently SunEdison through a wholly owned subsidiary) have the right, if the Subordination Period has expired and if we have made cash distributions in excess of the then-applicable Third Target Distribution for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on Terra LLC\u2019s cash distribution levels at the time of the exercise of the reset election. The right to reset the target distribution levels may be exercised without the approval of the holders of Terra LLC\u2019s units, us, as manager of Terra LLC, or our board of directors (or any committee thereof). Following a reset election, a baseline distribution amount will be calculated as an amount equal to the average cash distribution per Class A unit, Class B1 unit and Class B unit for the two consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the \u201cReset Minimum Quarterly Distribution\u201d), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the Reset Minimum Quarterly Distribution.\nIn connection with the reset election, the holders of the IDRs will receive Terra LLC Class B1 units and shares of our Class B1 common stock. Therefore, the reset of the IDRs will dilute existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. This dilution of ownership may cause dilution of future distributions per share as a higher percentage of distributions per share would go to SunEdison or a future owner of the IDRs if the IDRs are sold.\nWe anticipate that SunEdison would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions without such conversion. However, it is possible that SunEdison (or another holder) could exercise this reset election at a time when Terra LLC is experiencing declines in aggregate cash distributions or is expected to experience declines in its aggregate cash distributions. In such situations, the holder of the IDRs may desire to be issued Class B1 units rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. As a result, a reset election may cause the Company (which holds all of Terra LLC\u2019s Class A units), and, in turn, holders of our Class A common stock to experience a reduction in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had Terra LLC not issued new Class B1 units to the holders of the IDRs in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.\nThe IDRs may be transferred to a third party without the consent of holders of Terra LLC\u2019s units, us, as manager of Terra LLC, or our board of directors (or any committee thereof).\nSunEdison may not sell, transfer, exchange, pledge (other than as collateral under its credit facilities) or otherwise dispose of the IDRs to any third party (other than its controlled affiliates) until after it has satisfied its $175.0 million aggregate Projected FTM CAFD commitment to us in accordance with the Support Agreement. SunEdison has pledged the IDRs as collateral under its existing credit agreement and a margin loan agreement, but the IDRs may not be transferred upon foreclosure until after SunEdison has satisfied its Projected FTM CAFD commitment to us. After that period, SunEdison may transfer the IDRs to a third party at any time without the consent of the holders of Terra LLC\u2019s units, us, as manager of Terra LLC, or our board of directors (or any committee thereof). However, SunEdison has granted us a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed sale of IDRs to a third party (other than its controlled affiliates), which we may exercise to purchase the IDRs proposed to be sold on the same terms offered to such third party at any time within 30 days after we receive written notice of the proposed sale and its terms. If SunEdison transfers the IDRs to a third party, SunEdison would not have the same incentive to grow our business and increase quarterly distributions to holders of Class A common stock over time. For example, a transfer of IDRs by SunEdison could reduce the likelihood of SunEdison accepting offers made by us relating to assets owned by SunEdison, as it would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our portfolio.\nIf we incur material tax liabilities, distributions to holders of our Class A common stock may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of distributions paid to SunEdison or other holders of the IDRs, Class B units and Class B1 units.\nWe are entirely dependent upon distributions we receive from Terra LLC in respect of the Class A units held by us for payment of our expenses and other liabilities. We must make provisions for the payment of our income tax liabilities, if any, before we can use the cash distributions we receive from Terra LLC to make distributions to our Class A common stockholders. If we incur material tax liabilities, our distributions to holders of our Class A common stock may be reduced. However, the cash available to make distributions to the holders of the Class B units and IDRs issued by Terra LLC (all of which are currently held by SunEdison), or to the holders of any Class B1 units that may be issued by Terra LLC in connection with an IDR reset or otherwise, will not be reduced by the amount of our tax liabilities. As a result, if we incur material tax liabilities, distributions to holders of our Class A common stock may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of distributions paid to SunEdison or other holders of the IDRs, Class B units and Class B1 units of Terra LLC.\nOur ability to terminate the Management Services Agreement early will be limited.\nThe Management Services Agreement provides that we may terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior written notice to SunEdison upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) SunEdison defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained therein in a manner that results in material harm to us and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof is given to SunEdison; (ii) SunEdison engages in any act of fraud, misappropriation of funds or embezzlement that results in material harm to us; (iii) SunEdison is grossly negligent in the performance of its duties under the agreement and such negligence results in material harm to us; (iv) upon the happening of certain events relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of SunEdison; (v) upon the earlier to occur of the five-year anniversary of the date of the agreement and the end of any 12-month period ending on the last day of a calendar quarter during which we generated cash available for distribution in excess of $350.0 million; (vi) on such date as SunEdison and its affiliates no longer beneficially hold more than 50% of the voting power of our capital stock; and (v) upon the date that SunEdison experiences a change in control. Furthermore, if we request an amendment to the scope of services provided by SunEdison under the Management Services Agreement and we are not able to agree with SunEdison as to a change to the service fee resulting from a change in the scope of services within 180 days of the request, we will be able to terminate the agreement upon 30 days\u2019 prior notice to SunEdison.\nWe will not be able to terminate the agreement for any other reason, and the agreement continues in perpetuity until terminated in accordance with its terms. The Management Services Agreement includes non-compete provisions that prohibit us from engaging in certain activities competitive with SunEdison\u2019s power project development and construction business. These non-compete provisions will survive termination indefinitely. If SunEdison\u2019s performance does not meet the expectations of investors, and we are unable to terminate the Management Services Agreement, the market price of our Class A common stock could suffer.\nIf SunEdison terminates the Management Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement we may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms, or at all.\nWe will rely on SunEdison to provide us with management services under the Management Services Agreement and will not have independent executive, senior management or other personnel. The Management Services Agreement provides that SunEdison may terminate the agreement upon 180 days prior written notice of termination to us if we default in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained in the agreement in a manner that results in material harm to SunEdison and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice of the breach is given to us. If SunEdison terminates the Management Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, we may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms or at all, and the costs of substituting service providers may be substantial. In addition, in light of SunEdison\u2019s familiarity with our assets, a substitute service provider may not be able to provide the same level of service due to lack of preexisting synergies. If we cannot locate a service provider that is able to provide us with substantially similar services as SunEdison does under the Management Services Agreement on similar terms, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flow.\nSunEdison may offer certain Call Right Projects to third parties or remove Call Right Projects identified in the Support Agreement and we must still agree on a number of additional matters covered by the Support Agreement.\nPursuant to the Support Agreement, SunEdison has provided us with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase for cash certain solar generation facilities from its project pipeline with aggregate Projected FTM CAFD (as defined below) of at\nleast $175.0 million by the end of 2016. The Support Agreement identifies certain such facilities, which we believe will collectively satisfy a majority of the total Projected FTM CAFD commitment. SunEdison may, however, remove a project from the Call Right Project list effective upon notice to us, if, in its reasonable discretion, a project is unlikely to be successfully completed. In that case, SunEdison will be required to replace such project with one or more additional reasonably equivalent projects that have a similar economic profile. Additionally, in connection with the First Wind acquisition, we entered into the Intercompany Agreement with SunEdison, under which we were granted additional call rights with respect to certain power plants in the First Wind pipeline, which represent an additional 1.6 GW of wind and solar generation assets. These additional Call Right Projects under the Intercompany Agreement do not go towards satisfying SunEdison\u2019s $175.0 million CAFD commitment. As of February 20, 2015, the total nameplate capacity of the power plants to which we have call rights under both the Intercompany Agreement and the Support Agreement is 3.4 GW.\nThe Support Agreement also provides that SunEdison is required to offer us additional qualifying Call Right Projects from its pipeline on a quarterly basis until we have acquired Call Right Projects that are projected to generate the specified minimum amount of Projected FTM CAFD for each of the periods covered by the Support Agreement. These additional Call Right Projects must satisfy certain criteria, include being subject to a fully-executed PPA with a counterparty that, in our reasonable discretion, is creditworthy. The price for each Call Right Project will be the fair market value. The Support Agreement provides that we will work with SunEdison to mutually agree on the fair market value and Projected FTM CAFD of each Call Right Project within a reasonable time after it is added to the list of identified Call Right Projects. If we are unable to agree on the fair market value or Projected FTM CAFD for a project within 90 calendar days after it is added to the list (or such shorter period as will still allow us to complete the call right exercise process), we or SunEdison, upon written notice from either party, will engage a third-party advisor to determine the disputed item so that such material economic terms reflect common practice in the relevant market. The other economic terms with respect to our purchase of a Call Right Project will also be determined by mutual agreement or, if we are unable to reach agreement, by a third-party advisor. We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from the Support Agreement if we are unable to mutually agree with SunEdison with respect to these matters. Until the price for a Call Right Project is agreed or determined, in the event SunEdison receives a bona fide offer for a Call Right Project from a third party, we have the right to match the price offered by such third party and acquire such Call Right Project on the terms SunEdison could obtain from the third party. In addition, our effective remedies under the Support Agreement may also be limited in the event that a material dispute with SunEdison arises under the terms of the Support Agreement.\nIn addition, SunEdison has agreed to grant us a right of first offer on any of the ROFO Projects that it determines to sell or otherwise transfer during the six-year period following the completion of our IPO. Under the terms of the Support Agreement, SunEdison agrees to negotiate with us in good faith, for a period of 30 days, to reach an agreement with respect to any proposed sale of a ROFO Project for which we have exercised our right of first offer before it may sell or otherwise transfer such ROFO Project to a third party. However, SunEdison will not be obligated to sell any of the ROFO Projects and, as a result, we do not know when, if ever, any ROFO Projects will be offered to us. Furthermore, in the event that SunEdison elects to sell ROFO Projects, SunEdison will not be required to accept any offer we make and may choose to sell the assets to a third party or not sell the assets at all.\nThe liability of SunEdison is limited under our arrangements with it and we have agreed to indemnify SunEdison against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead it to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to us than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account.\nUnder the Management Services Agreement, SunEdison will not assume any responsibility other than to provide or arrange for the provision of the services described in the Management Services Agreement in good faith. In addition, under the Management Services Agreement, the liability of SunEdison and its affiliates will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law to conduct involving bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence or, in the case of a criminal matter, action that was known to have been unlawful. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify SunEdison to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by an indemnified person or threatened in connection with our operations, investments and activities or in respect of or arising from the Management Services Agreement or the services provided by SunEdison, except to the extent that the claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses are determined to have resulted from the conduct in respect of which such persons have liability as described above. These protections may result in SunEdison tolerating greater risks when making decisions than otherwise would be the case, including when determining whether to use leverage in connection with acquisitions. The indemnification arrangements to which SunEdison is a party may also give rise to legal claims for indemnification that are adverse to us or holders of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Inherent in an Investment in TerraForm Power, Inc.\nWe may not be able to continue paying comparable or growing cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock in the future.\nThe amount of our cash available for distribution principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate the First Wind assets and realize the anticipated benefits of the First Wind acquisition;\n\u2022\ncounterparties\u2019 to our offtake agreements willingness and ability to fulfill their obligations under such agreements;\n\u2022\nprice fluctuations, termination provisions and buyout provisions related to our offtake agreements;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into contracts to sell power on acceptable terms as our offtake agreements expire;\n\u2022\ndelays or unexpected costs during the completion of construction of certain projects we intend to acquire;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully identify, evaluate and consummate acquisitions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation, including compliance with regulatory and permit requirements and changes in market rules, rates, tariffs and environmental laws;\n\u2022\noperating and financial restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries related to agreements governing our indebtedness and other agreements of certain of our subsidiaries and project-level subsidiaries generally and in our New Revolver;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow additional funds and access capital markets, as well as our substantial indebtedness and the possibility that we may incur additional indebtedness going forward;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete against traditional and renewable energy companies;\n\u2022\nhazards customary to the power production industry and power generation operations such as unusual weather conditions, catastrophic weather-related or other damage to facilities, unscheduled generation outages, maintenance or repairs, interconnection problems or other developments, environmental incidents, or electric transmission constraints and the possibility that we may not have adequate insurance to cover losses as a result of such hazards;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand into new business segments or new geographies; and\n\u2022\nour ability to operate our businesses efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs tightly, manage risks related to international operations and generate earnings and cash flow from our asset-based businesses in relation to our debt and other obligations.\nAs a result of all these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash generated from operations to pay a specific level of cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, holders of our Class A common stock should be aware that the amount of cash available for distribution depends primarily on our cash flow, and is not solely a function of profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. We may incur other expenses or liabilities during a period that could significantly reduce or eliminate our cash available for distribution and, in turn, impair our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock during the period. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock is limited by restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing project-level financing. Our project-level financing agreements prohibit distributions to us unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of financial ratios. Our New Revolver also restricts our ability to declare and pay dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or if the payment of the dividend would result in an event of default.\nTo the extent we issue additional equity securities in connection with any acquisitions or growth capital expenditures, the payment of dividends on these additional equity securities may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per share dividend. There are no limitations in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (other than a specified number of authorized shares) on our ability to issue equity securities, including securities ranking senior to our common stock. The incurrence of bank borrowings or other debt by Terra Operating, LLC or by our project-level subsidiaries to finance our growth strategy will result in increased interest expense and the imposition of additional or more restrictive covenants which, in turn, may impact the cash distributions we distribute to holders of our Class A common stock.\nTerra LLC\u2019s cash available for distribution will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in some cases significantly, due to seasonality. As result, we may cause Terra LLC to reduce the amount of cash it distributes to its members in a particular quarter to establish reserves to fund distributions to its members in future periods for which the cash distributions we would normally receive from Terra LLC would otherwise be insufficient to fund our quarterly dividend. If we fail to cause Terra LLC to establish sufficient reserves, we may not be able to maintain our quarterly dividend with respect to a quarter adversely affected by seasonality.\nFinally, dividends to holders of our Class A common stock will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may decrease the level of or entirely discontinue payment of dividends.\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in Terra LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Terra LLC and its subsidiaries to pay dividends and taxes and other expenses.\nTerraForm Power is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of membership interests in Terra LLC, a holding company that will have no material assets other than its interest in Terra Operating LLC, whose sole material assets are the solar generation facilities and wind power plants that comprise our portfolio and the projects that we subsequently acquire. TerraForm Power, Terra LLC and Terra Operating LLC have no independent means of generating revenue. We intend to cause Terra Operating LLC\u2019s subsidiaries to make distributions to Terra Operating LLC and, in turn, make distributions to Terra LLC, and, Terra LLC, in turn, to make distributions to TerraForm Power in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by us. To the extent that we need funds to pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our Class A common stock or otherwise, and Terra Operating LLC or Terra LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds (including as a result of Terra Operating LLC\u2019s operating subsidiaries being unable to make distributions), it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and limit our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock.\nMarket interest rates may have an effect on the value of our Class A common stock.\nOne of the factors that influences the price of shares of our Class A common stock will be the effective dividend yield of such shares (i.e., the yield as a percentage of the then market price of our shares) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our Class A common stock to expect a higher dividend yield. If market interest rates increase and we are unable to increase our dividend in response, including due to an increase in borrowing costs, insufficient cash available for distribution or otherwise, investors may seek alternative investments with higher yield, which would result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of, our Class A common stock. As a result, the price of our Class A common stock may decrease as market interest rates increase.\nThe market price and marketability of our shares may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings.\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly. Many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our shares and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies, business development companies or companies in our sectors, which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our earnings or variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory policies or tax law;\n\u2022\noperating performance of companies comparable to us; and\n\u2022\nloss of funding sources.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d controlled by SunEdison, whose interest in our business may be different from ours or the holders of our Class A common stock.\nEach share of our Class B common stock entitles SunEdison or its controlled affiliates to 10 votes on matters presented to our stockholders generally. SunEdison owns all of our Class B common stock. Therefore, SunEdison will control a majority of the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of our directors, for the foreseeable future even if its ownership of our Class B common stock represents less than 50% of the outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class B1 common stock on a combined basis. As a result, we are and will likely continue to be considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are permitted to opt out of the NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements that require (i) a majority of the members of our board of directors to be independent, (ii) that we establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent directors, and (iii) an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. We rely on exceptions with respect to having a majority of independent directors, establishing a compensation committee or nominating committee and annual performance evaluations of such committees.\nThe NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. As further described above in \u201c-Risks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison,\u201d it is possible that the interests of SunEdison may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of holders of our Class A common stock. Should SunEdison\u2019s interests differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to holders of our Class A common stock, and could make it more difficult to change management.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that holders of our Class A common stock may consider favorable, including transactions in which such stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. This is because these provisions may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to replace or remove members of our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent once SunEdison ceases to hold a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called upon a resolution approved by a majority of our directors then in office;\n\u2022\nthe right of SunEdison as the holder of our Class B common stock, to appoint up to two additional directors to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the \u201cDGCL,\u201d prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally a person that together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of voting stock), for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. As a result of these provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, the price investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock may be limited.\nAdditionally, in order to ensure compliance with Section 203 of the FPA, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from acquiring, without prior FERC authorization or the written consent of our board of directors, in purchases other than secondary market transactions (i) an amount of our Class A or Class B1 common stock that, after giving effect to such acquisition, would allow such purchaser together with its affiliates (as understood for purposes of FPA Section 203) to exercise 10% or more of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A, Class B and Class B1 common stock in the aggregate, or (ii) an amount of our Class A common stock or Class B1 common stock as otherwise determined by our board of directors sufficient to allow such purchaser together with its affiliates to exercise control over our company. Any acquisition of our Class A common stock or Class B1 common stock in violation of this prohibition shall not be effective to transfer record, beneficial, legal or any other ownership of such common stock, and the transferee shall not be entitled to any rights as a stockholder with respect to such common stock (including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends with respect thereto). Any acquisition of 10% or greater voting power or a change of control with respect to us or any of our solar and wind generation project companies could require prior authorization from FERC under Section 203 the FPA. Furthermore, a \u201cholding company\u201d (as defined in PUHCA) and its \u201caffiliates\u201d (as defined in PUHCA) may be subject to restrictions on the acquisition of our Class A common stock or Class B1 common stock in secondary market transactions to which other acquirors are not subject. A purchaser of our securities which is a \u201cholding company\u201d or an \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cassociate company\u201d of such a \u201cholding company\u201d (as defined in PUHCA) should seek their own legal counsel to determine whether a given purchase of our securities may require prior FERC approval.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interest due to the future issuance of additional shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe are in a capital intensive business, and may not have sufficient funds to finance the growth of our business, future acquisitions or to support our projected capital expenditures. As a result, we may require additional funds from further equity or debt financings, including tax equity financing transactions or sales of preferred shares or convertible debt to complete future acquisitions, expansions and capital expenditures and pay the general and administrative costs of our business. In the future, we may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of purchasers of\nour Class A common stock offered hereby. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 850,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 140,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, 260,000,000 shares of Class B1 common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or convertible debt may create downward pressure on the trading price of our Class A common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our Class A common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our Class A common stock in future public offerings or private placements for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes, potentially at an offering price, conversion price or exercise price that is below the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the stock price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock by SunEdison, Riverstone or the Private Placement Purchasers may cause the price of our Class A common stock to fall.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of such shares (issuable to SunEdison or Riverstone upon the exchange of some or all of its Class B units or Class B1 units of Terra LLC) by SunEdison, Riverstone, the IPO Private Placement Purchasers or the Acquisition Private Placement Purchasers (together with the IPO Private Placement Purchasers, the \u201cPrivate Placement Purchasers\u201d) in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may also decline as a result of SunEdison disposing or transferring some or all of our outstanding Class B common stock, which disposals or transfers would reduce SunEdison\u2019s ownership interest in, and voting control over, us. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. In addition, in connection with the First Wind acquisition, SunEdison issued $336.5 million of seller notes that, pursuant to their terms, may be converted into shares of our Class A common stock that are issued in exchange for Class B units and Class B common stock currently held by SunEdison.\nSunEdison, certain of its affiliates, Riverstone and the IPO Private Placement Purchasers have certain registration rights with respect to shares of our Class A common stock issued or issuable upon the exchange of Class B units or Class B1 units of Terra LLC. The presence of additional shares of our Class A common stock trading in the public market, including as a result of the exercise of registration rights, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities. We filed a registration statement relating to the resale of the shares of our Class A common stock issued in the Acquisition Private Placement and such shares are freely tradable without restriction by the Acquisition Private Placement Purchasers.\nSunEdison has pledged the shares of Class B common stock that it owns to its lenders under its credit facilities. If the lenders foreclose on these shares, the market price of our shares of Class A common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nSunEdison has pledged approximately 25% of the shares of Class B common stock, and a corresponding amount of the Class B units of Terra LLC, that it owns to its lenders as security under its credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint syndication agents, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., as joint bookrunners, and the lenders identified in the credit agreement. If SunEdison breaches certain covenants and obligations in its credit facility, an event of default could result and the lenders could exercise their right to accelerate all the debt under the credit facility and foreclose on the pledged shares (and a corresponding number of Class B units). Any future sale of the shares of Class A common stock received upon foreclosure of the pledged securities after the expiration of the lock-up periods could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. In addition, SunEdison has pledged approximately 75% of the shares of Class B common stock, and a corresponding amount of the Class B units of Terra LLC, that it owns, as security for the margin loan agreement and exchangeable note it entered into in connection with the First Wind acquisition. If there is an event of default on the margin loan agreement or the exchangeable note, it may result in the sale of a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock, including during the 90-day lock-up period, which\ncould cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. In addition, because SunEdison owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, the occurrence of an event of default, foreclosure, and a subsequent sale of all, or substantially all, of the shares of Class A common stock received upon foreclosure of any pledged securities could result in a change of control, even when such change may not be in the best interest of our stockholders. SunEdison, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SunEdison Holdings Corporation, owns 62,726,654 Class B units of Terra LLC, which are exchangeable (together with shares of our Class B common stock) for shares of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nTax provisions and policies supporting renewable energy could change at any time, and such changes may result in a material increase in our estimated future income tax liability.\nRenewable generation assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local tax incentives, including ITCs, PTCs and a modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation. The Code currently provides an ITC of 30% of the cost-basis of an eligible facility, including certain solar energy facilities placed in service prior to the end of 2016, which percentage is currently scheduled to be reduced to 10% for solar generation facilities placed in service after December 31, 2016. The U.S. Congress could reduce, replace or eliminate the ITC. PTCs, or ITCs in lieu of PTCs, for wind generation assets apply only to projects the construction of which began prior to the end of 2014 and, the U.S. Congress could fail to extend the termination of, renew or replace such incentives. In addition, we benefit from an accelerated tax depreciation schedule for our eligible solar generation facilities and wind power plants. The U.S. Congress could in the future eliminate or modify such accelerated depreciation. Moreover, the cost-basis of eligible projects acquired from SunEdison may be reduced if a tax authority were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arms\u2019 length prices, in which case the amount of our expected ITC and depreciation deductions would be reduced. Additionally, we may be required to repay a Section 1603 Grant, with interest, if the U.S. Treasury were to successfully challenge a solar generation facility and wind power plant for which such a Section 1603 Grant has been made as not complying with the requirements of Section 1603.\nAny reduction in our ITCs, PTCs or depreciation deductions as a result of a change in law or successful transfer pricing challenge, or any elimination or modification of the accelerated tax depreciation schedule, may result in a material increase in our estimated future income tax liability and may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future tax liability may be greater than expected if we do not generate Net Operating Losses, or \"NOLs,\" sufficient to offset taxable income.\nWe expect to generate NOLs and NOL carryforwards that we can utilize to offset future taxable income. Based on our portfolio of assets that we expect will benefit from an accelerated tax depreciation schedule, and subject to tax obligations resulting from potential tax audits, we do not expect to pay significant United States federal income tax in the near term. However, in the event these losses are not generated as expected (including if our accelerated tax depreciation schedule for our eligible solar generation facilities and wind power plants is eliminated or adversely modified), are successfully challenged by the IRS (in a tax audit or otherwise), or are subject to future limitations as a result of an \u201cownership change\u201d as discussed below, our ability to realize these future tax benefits may be limited. Any such reduction, limitation, or challenge may result in a material increase in our estimated future income tax liabilities and may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use NOLs generated in the future could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain holders (generally 5% holders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such holders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership over a rolling three-year period. If a corporation undergoes an ownership change, its ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change deferred tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. Future sales of our Class A common stock by SunEdison, as well as future issuances by us, could contribute to a potential ownership change.\nA valuation allowance may be required for our deferred tax assets.\nOur expected NOLs will be reflected as a deferred tax asset as they are generated until utilized to offset income. Valuation allowances may need to be maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets\ncan be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels and based on input from our auditors, tax advisors or regulatory authorities. In the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to maintain profitability.", "PERMNO": 14831, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "TERP"}
