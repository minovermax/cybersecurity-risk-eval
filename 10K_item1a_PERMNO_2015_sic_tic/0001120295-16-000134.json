{"cik": "1120295", "company": "IXIA", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe statements that are not historical facts contained in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect the current belief, expectations or intent of our management and are subject to and involve certain risks and uncertainties. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside of our control and are difficult for us to forecast or mitigate. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in certain of our other SEC filings, the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by us in any forward-looking statements contained herein or made elsewhere by or on behalf of us.\nOur business may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and market conditions.\nOur business is subject to the effects of general global and regional economic conditions, including those in the United States and, in particular, market conditions in the communications and networking industries. In the past, our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced or deferred capital spending in the United States, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions continue to be volatile and uncertain. If global and/or regional economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business. Unfavorable and/or uncertain economic and market conditions may result in lower capital spending by our customers on network test and monitoring solutions, and therefore demand for our products could decline, adversely impacting our revenue and our ability to accurately forecast the future demand and revenue trends for our products and services. Challenging economic and market conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for the products and services they have purchased.\nIn addition, prolonged unfavorable economic conditions and market turbulence may also negatively impact our contract manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 capability to timely supply and manufacture our products, thereby impairing our ability to meet our contractual obligations to our customers. These effects, as well as any other currently unforeseeable effects, are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a result, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, financial condition, and stock price.\nAcquisitions undertaken and any that we may undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and significantly harm our operating results.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that our previous acquisitions, including our 2013 acquisition of Net Optics, or any future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We expect to continue to review opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies that would add to our existing product line, complement and enhance our current products, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. While we are not currently a party to any pending acquisition agreements, we may acquire additional businesses, products or technologies in the future. If we make any further acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership, and we could incur substantial debt or assume substantial liabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nproblems or delays in assimilating or transitioning to Ixia the acquired operations, systems, processes, controls, technologies, products, or personnel;\n\u2022\nloss of acquired customer accounts;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nour failure to identify in the due diligence process significant issues with product quality or development and liabilities related to operational issues, intellectual property infringement or tax or other regulatory matters;\n\u2022\nmultiple and overlapping product lines as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays in orders;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships of Ixia or the acquired business with suppliers, licensors, contract manufacturers, customers, resellers, and industry experts;\n\u2022\nsignificant impairment, exit and/or restructuring charges if the products or technologies acquired in an acquisition do not meet our sales expectations or are unsuccessful;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of the acquired organization\u2019s or our own key employees.\nMergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and we cannot be certain that we would be successful in overcoming problems in connection with our past or future acquisitions. Our inability to do so could significantly harm our business, revenues and results of operations. See Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nCompetition in our market could significantly harm our results of operations.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive. We currently compete with network test and monitoring solution vendors such as Spirent Communications and Gigamon. We also compete either directly or indirectly with large Ethernet switch vendors and network management, analysis, compliance, and test tool vendors that offer point solutions that address a subset of the issues that we solve. Additionally, some of our significant customers have developed, or may develop, in-house products for their own use or for sale to others. For example, Cisco Systems, our largest customer, has used internally developed test products for a number of years. Although Cisco Systems has in the past accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, we cannot be certain that it will continue to do so.\nAs we broaden our product offerings, we may move into new markets and face additional competition. Moreover, our competitors may have more experience operating in these new markets and be better established with the customers in these new markets.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities than we do. Moreover, our competitors may consolidate with each other, or with other companies, giving them an even greater capability to compete against us.\nIncreased competition in the network test and monitoring markets could result in increased pressure on us to reduce prices and could result in a reduction in our revenues and/or a decrease in our profit margins, each of which could significantly harm our results of operations. In addition, increased competition could prevent us from increasing our market share, or cause us to lose our existing market share, either of which would harm our revenues and profitability.\nWe cannot predict whether our current or future competitors will develop or market technologies and products that offer higher performance or more features, or that are more cost-effective than our current or future products. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop cost-effective products and product enhancements which offer higher performance and more functionality. Our failure to do so will harm our revenues and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or introduce new products to keep pace with the rapid technological changes that characterize our market, our revenues and results of operations will be significantly harmed.\nThe market for our products is characterized by:\n\u2022\nrapid technological change such as the recent advancements of IP-based networks and wireless technologies;\n\u2022\nfrequent new product introductions such as higher speed and more complex routers;\n\u2022\nevolving industry standards;\n\u2022\nchanging customer needs such as the increase in advanced IP services agreed to between service providers and their customers;\n\u2022\nshort product life cycles as a result of rapid changes in our customers\u2019 products; and\n\u2022\nnew paradigms like Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (\"SDN\").\nOur performance will depend on our successful development and introductions, and on market acceptance, of new and enhanced products that address new technologies and changes in customer requirements. If we experience any delay in the development or introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products, our revenues and operating results may suffer. For instance, undetected software or hardware errors, which frequently occur when new products are first introduced, could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and the loss of credibility with our customers. In addition, if we are not able to develop or license, or acquire from third parties, the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements, our existing products are likely to become technologically obsolete over time, and our revenues and operating results will suffer. If the rate of development of new technologies and transmission protocols by our customers is delayed, the growth of the market for our products, and therefore our revenues and operating results, may be harmed.\nOur ability to successfully introduce new products in a timely fashion will depend on multiple factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nanticipate technological changes and industry trends;\n\u2022\nproperly identify customer needs;\n\u2022\ninnovate, develop and license or acquire new technologies and applications;\n\u2022\nhire and retain necessary technical personnel;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ntimely obtain key components for the manufacture of new products;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;\n\u2022\nprice our products competitively;\n\u2022\nprovide high quality, timely technical support; and\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our offerings from our competitors\u2019 offerings.\nThe development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market, or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely or cost-effective basis. Further, we cannot be certain that any new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes, emerging industry standards or product announcements by our competitors. If we fail to respond to technological changes and the needs of our markets, our revenues, results of operations and competitive position will suffer.\nWe depend on sales of a narrow range of products and therefore if the markets for those products contract or do not grow and customers do not purchase our products, our revenues and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\nOur business and products are concentrated in the markets for systems that analyze and measure the performance of wired and wireless IP-based networks, and systems that provide network visibility into physical and virtual networks and optimize monitoring tool performance. These markets continue to evolve, and there is uncertainty regarding the future size and scope of these markets. If these markets contract, fail to grow or grow more slowly than we expect, our revenues and results of operations would be significantly harmed. Our performance will depend on increased sales of our existing systems into our markets and the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products in those markets. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing these sales or in developing and introducing new products. Our failure to do so would significantly harm our revenues and results of operations.\nBecause we depend on a limited number of customers and on a limited customer base for a significant portion of our revenues, any cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by one or more of these customers, and any failure by us to maintain, expand and diversify our customer base, could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations.\nHistorically, a limited number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues. We expect that some customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future and that our operating results will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a limited number of customers. Our dependence on large orders from a limited number of customers makes our relationships with these customers critical to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our largest customers, that we will be able to increase sales to our other existing customers, or that we will be able to attract additional customers. From time to time, we have experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have sought price reductions or other concessions from us and will likely continue to do so. We typically do not have long-term or volume purchase contracts with our customers, and our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty, and they are free to purchase products from our competitors. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or delay in sales to one of these customers, our inability to successfully develop and maintain relationships with existing and new large customers, or requirements that we make price reductions or other concessions, could significantly harm our revenues and results of operations.\nHistorically, the majority of our total revenues have been generated from sales to network equipment manufacturers. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to diversify our customer base by increasing sales to service provider, enterprise and government customers. To effectively compete for the business of these customers, we must develop new products and enhancements to existing products and expand our direct and indirect sales, marketing and customer service capabilities, which will result in increases in operating costs. If we cannot offset these increases in costs with an increase in our revenues, our operating results may be adversely affected. Some of our existing and potential competitors have existing relationships with many service providers, enterprise and government customers. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing our sales presence in these customer markets. Any failure by us to diversify our customer base and to increase sales in these markets would adversely affect our growth.\nIf we are unable to expand and maintain our sales and distribution channels or are unable to successfully manage our expanded sales organization, our revenues and results of operations will be harmed.\nHistorically, we have relied primarily on a direct sales organization, supported by distributors, resellers and other partners, to sell our products. We may not be able to successfully expand our sales and distribution channels, and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenues that we generate as a result of the expansion. To the extent that we are successful in expanding our sales and distribution channels, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against the significantly larger and better-funded sales and marketing operations of many of our current or potential competitors. In some cases, we may grant exclusive rights to certain distributors to market our products in their specified territories. Our distributors may not market our products effectively or devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing and technical support. In the past, we have had distributors who entered bankruptcy or who performed poorly and were therefore terminated as distributors of our products. Moreover, if we terminate a distribution relationship for performance-related or other reasons, we may be subject to wrongful termination claims which may result in material litigation and could adversely impact our profitability. Our inability to effectively manage our current and any expansion of our sales organization, or to maintain existing or establish new relationships with successful distributors and partners, would harm our business, revenues and results of operations.\nOur large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business.\nLarge network equipment manufacturers and service providers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. These customers may require us to develop additional features, reduce our prices or grant other concessions. As we seek to sell more products to these large customers, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions. These terms may affect the amounts and timing of revenue recognition and our profit margins, which may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition in the affected periods.\nWe cannot assure investors that we will be able to fully address the material weakness in our internal controls that existed at December 31, 2015, or that remediation efforts will be fully effective or that we will not have future material weaknesses.\nOur management has identified, and we have disclosed in this Form 10-K, a control deficiency in our financial reporting process that, as of December 31, 2015, constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness, which relates to revenue recognition, also existed at December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. In 2015, we continued to implement and initiate measures to remediate this material weakness, and we plan to implement in 2016 additional appropriate measures as part of our effort to fully remediate this material weakness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to fully remediate this material weakness or prevent this material weakness from re-occurring in the future.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer from other material weaknesses in the future. Our internal control over financial reporting was also ineffective as of December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. If we fail to remediate this material weakness or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such failure could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements, limit our ability to raise capital and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, failure to remediate our existing material weakness or otherwise failing to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may also negatively impact our operating results and financial condition, impair our ability to timely file our periodic and other reports with the SEC, adversely affect shareholders' confidence, subject us to additional litigation and regulatory actions, consume a significant amount of management's time, and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have historically fluctuated or may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of new product introductions, changes in judgments or estimates, and/or other factors, which could cause our stock price to decline significantly.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of the factors that could cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate include the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We may experience a shortfall or delay in generating or recognizing revenues for a number of reasons. Orders on hand at the beginning of a quarter and orders generated in a quarter do not always result in the shipment of products and the recognition of revenues for that quarter. For example, the deferral or cancellation of, or failure to ship, an order by the end of the quarter in which it was made, or our inability to recognize revenue for products shipped in a quarter in which they occurred due to nonstandard terms in our sales arrangements, may adversely affect our operating results for that quarter. Our agreements with customers typically provide that the customer may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders prior to shipment without significant penalty. Because we incur operating expenses based on anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term, any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our orders generated and product shipments in each quarter occurs near the end of the quarter. Since individual orders can represent a meaningful percentage of our revenues and net income in any quarter, the deferral or cancellation of, or failure to ship, an order in a quarter in which it was made, may result in a revenue and net income shortfall, which could cause us to fail to meet securities analysts\u2019 expectations, our business plan projections, or financial guidance provided by us. Revenue and net income shortfall of this type, in any given quarter, may also increase the amount of our revenues and net income in future periods.\nOur operating results may also vary as a result of the timing of new product releases. The introduction of a new product in any quarter may cause an increase in revenues in that quarter that may not be sustainable in subsequent quarters. Conversely, a delay in introducing a new product in a quarter may result in a decrease in revenues in that quarter and lost sales. Our results may also fluctuate based on the mix of products and services (i.e., hardware, software and extended warranty and maintenance services) ordered in a particular quarter.\nFurther, actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements could significantly harm our results of operations.\nThe factors described above are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict, and therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe expect our gross margins to vary over time and our recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable, which may have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.\nOur recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nincreased price competition;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer, geographic or product mix (such as the mix of software versus hardware product sales);\n\u2022\nnew product introductions by us and by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in shipment volume;\n\u2022\nexcess or obsolete inventory costs;\n\u2022\nincreased industry consolidation among our customers, which may lead to decreased demand for, and downward pricing pressure on, our products; and\n\u2022\nincreases in labor costs.\nEach of the above factors may be exacerbated by a decrease in demand for our established products and our transition to our next-generation products. Our failure to sustain our recent level of gross margins due to these or other factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur restatements in 2013 and 2014 of certain of our prior period consolidated financial statements and any future required restatements may affect shareholder confidence, may consume a significant amount of our time and resources, and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nIn recent years we have restated certain of our prior period consolidated financial statements in our filings with the SEC, including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarters ended March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013. Those restatements corrected certain errors in our previously filed financial statements, including errors in the timing of revenue recognition. We cannot be certain that the measures we have taken since we completed the restatements will ensure that restatements will not occur in the future. Those restatements and any future restatements may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, may raise reputational issues for our business and may result in a decline in our share price and the filing of shareholder lawsuits.\nRestatements are typically resource-intensive and involve a significant amount of internal resources, including attention from management, and significant legal and accounting costs. Although we completed our restatement filings in June 2014, we cannot guarantee that we will not receive further inquiries from the SEC or The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) regarding our restated financial statements or matters relating thereto or that our restated financial statements for the quarterly periods will not become the subject of additional shareholder lawsuits. Any future inquiries from the SEC or Nasdaq as a result of our 2013 and 2014 restatements may, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our internal resources and result in additional legal and accounting costs.\nWe are subject to a shareholder class action and a consolidated shareholder derivative action, as well as a pending SEC investigation, and these lawsuits and investigation and any future such lawsuits and investigations may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors are defendants in a federal securities class action lawsuit and in a shareholder derivative action. These lawsuits and the SEC investigation, including their current status, are described in Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Form 10-K. While we have reached proposed settlements in both such lawsuits and we are in discussions with the Staff of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement concerning a proposed settlement of the SEC investigation, we cannot guarantee the outcome of such matters. These and any similar future matters may divert our attention from our ordinary business operations, and we may incur significant expenses associated with them (including, without limitation, substantial attorneys\u2019 fees and other fees of professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify current and former officers and directors who are or may become parties to or involved in such matters). Depending on the outcome of such matters, we could be required to pay material damages and fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, and/or suffer other penalties, remedies, or sanctions. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these pending matters or any similar future matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and ability to meet our debt obligations and could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Any existing or future shareholder lawsuits and governmental investigations and/or any future governmental enforcement actions could also adversely impact our reputation, our relationships with our customers, and our ability to generate revenue.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could significantly harm our business, results of operations and competitive position.\nIn order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and restricted stock units. If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.\nMoreover, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be subject to such claims as we seek to retain or hire qualified personnel, some of whom may currently be working for our competitors. Some of these claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us.\nAny loss of the services of executives and key employees and the inability to attract or retain qualified executives and key employees may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives, including without limitation our ability to successfully market and sell our products and services, our ability to develop new products and product enhancements, our ability to support our products, and our ability to pursue strategic business growth and development objectives.\nSome key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products.\nWe and our contract manufacturers currently purchase a number of key components used to manufacture our products from sole or limited sources of supply for which alternative sources may not be available. From time to time, we have experienced shortages of key components, including chips, oscillators, memory devices and optical modules. We and our contract manufacturers have no guaranteed or long-term supply arrangements for these or other components, including field programmable gate arrays (\"FPGAs\") and NPs, which are integrated circuits that can be repeatedly reprogrammed to perform different sets of functions as required. Financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in market demand for necessary components could limit the availability to us and our contract manufacturers of these components. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales.\nIn addition, the purchase of these components on a sole or limited source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems. Consolidation involving suppliers could further reduce the number of alternatives available to us and affect the availability and cost of components. An increase in the cost of components could make our products less competitive and result in lower gross margins.\nThere are limited substitute supplies available for many of these components, including FPGAs. All of these components are critical to the production of our products, and competition exists with other manufacturers for these key components. In the event that we can no longer obtain materials from a sole source supplier, we might not be able to qualify or identify alternative suppliers in a timely fashion, or at all. Any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from a sole or limited source or delay in transitioning to a replacement supplier\u2019s product or replacement component into our systems could disrupt our operations and significantly harm our business in any given period.\nFailure by our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products could harm our revenues, results of operations, competitive position and reputation.\nWe currently rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to manufacture and assemble our products. We may experience delays in receiving product shipments from contract manufacturers or other problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product. We cannot be certain that we will be able to effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity. We intend to introduce new products and product enhancements, which will require that we rapidly achieve adequate production volumes by effectively coordinating with our suppliers and contract manufacturers. The inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products or the loss of any of our contract manufacturers would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill customer orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would harm our revenues, results of operations, competitive position and reputation.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs and experience manufacturing delays.\nWe provide our contract manufacturers with rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our manufacturing requirements. Some of the components used in our products have significant lead times or lead times which may unexpectedly increase depending on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and the demand for components at a given time. Because of these long lead times, we are often required to forecast and order products before we know what our specific manufacturing requirements will be. If we overestimate our product orders, our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory of completed products which we would be obligated to purchase. This will lead to increased costs and the risk of obsolescence. If we underestimate our product orders, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory, which could result in delays in shipments, the loss or deferral of revenues and/or higher costs of sales. Costs are also added to our products when we are required to expedite delivery of our products to customers or of components with long lead times to our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we will be able to accurately forecast our product orders and may in the future carry excess or obsolete inventory, be unable to fulfill customer demand, or both, thereby harming our revenues, results of operations and customer relationships.\nContinued growth will strain our operations and require us to incur costs to maintain and upgrade our management and operational resources.\nWe have experienced growth in our operations, including number of employees, sales, products, facility locations and customers, including as a result of our prior acquisitions, and expect to continue to experience growth in the future. Unless we manage our past and future growth effectively, we may have difficulty in operating our business. As a result, we may inaccurately forecast sales and materials requirements, fail to integrate new personnel or fail to maintain adequate internal controls or systems, which may result in fluctuations in our operating results and cause the price of our stock to decline. We may continue to expand our operations to enhance our product development efforts and broaden our sales reach, which may place a significant strain on our management and operational resources. In order to manage our growth effectively, we must improve and implement our operational systems, procedures and controls on a timely basis. If we cannot manage growth effectively, our profitability could be significantly harmed.\nChanges in industry and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products and asset impairments.\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources by restructuring our operations and/or our product offerings. Any decision to limit investment in or dispose of a product offering may result in the recording of special charges to earnings, such as inventory, fixed asset and technology-related write-offs and charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position.\nInternational activity may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our business.\nWe plan to continue to maintain or expand our international operations and sales activities. Operating internationally involves inherent risks that we may not be able to control, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in recruiting, hiring, training and retaining international personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased complexity and costs of managing international operations;\n\u2022\ngrowing demand for and cost of technical personnel;\n\u2022\nchanging governmental laws and regulations, including those related to income taxes, the UK Anti-Bribery Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including military conflict and social unrest;\n\u2022\ncommercial laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor and employment laws;\n\u2022\nsupporting multiple languages;\n\u2022\nreduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nmore complicated logistical and distribution arrangements; and\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable cycles and difficulties in collecting receivables.\nThe above risks associated with our international operations and sales activities can restrict or adversely affect our ability to sell in international markets, disrupt our business and subject us to additional costs of doing business.\nOur reported financial results could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets.\nWe are required to (i) test annually, and review when circumstances warrant, the value of our goodwill associated with acquisitions, and (ii) test the value of our acquisition-related intangible assets when circumstances warrant determining if an impairment has occurred. If such assets are deemed impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the applicable carrying amount exceeds (i) the implied fair value of the goodwill or (ii) the estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets would be recognized. This would result in an incremental charge for that quarter which would adversely impact our earnings for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred. For example, such impairment could occur if the market value of our common stock falls below the carrying value of our net assets for a sustained period. Recent economic downturns have contributed to extreme price and volume fluctuations in global stock markets that have reduced the market price of many technology company stocks, including ours. Such declines in our stock price or the failure of our stock price to recover from these declines, as well as any marked decline in our level of revenues or profit margins increase the risk that goodwill may become impaired in future periods. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of our goodwill or acquired intangible assets.\nLegal proceedings may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a party to lawsuits and other legal proceedings in the normal course of our business. Litigation and other legal proceedings can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. We cannot provide assurance that we will not be a party to additional legal proceedings in the future or that we will be able to favorably resolve our current lawsuits. To the extent legal proceedings continue for long time periods or are adversely resolved, our business, results of operations and financial position could be significantly harmed. For additional information regarding certain of the legal matters in which we are involved, see Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d contained in Part I of this Form 10-K and in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. For information regarding the risks associated with the shareholder class action and the consolidated shareholder derivative action, see \u201cWe are subject to a shareholder class action and a consolidated shareholder derivative action, as well as a pending SEC investigation, and these lawsuits and investigation and any future such lawsuits and investigations may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\u201d above.\nClaims that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products.\nFrom time to time, other parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and items that are important to our business. We cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or that we do not in fact infringe upon or misappropriate those intellectual property rights. We have not generally conducted searches to determine whether the technology we have in our products infringes or misappropriates intellectual property rights held by third parties.\nAny claims asserting that any of our products or services infringe or misappropriate proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly affect our ability to conduct business and harm our results of operations. Any such claims, with or without merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe time-consuming;\n\u2022\nresult in costly and protracted litigation;\n\u2022\ndivert the efforts of our technical and management personnel;\n\u2022\nrequire us to modify the products or services at issue or to develop alternative technology, thereby causing delivery delays and the loss or deferral of revenues;\n\u2022\nrequire us to cease selling the products or services at issue;\n\u2022\nrequire us to pay substantial damage awards;\n\u2022\nexpose us to indemnity claims from our customers;\n\u2022\ndamage our reputation; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIn the event any such claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms, license a substitute technology or redesign our products or services to avoid infringement or misappropriation, our revenues, results of operations, and competitive position could be harmed.\nThe inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities or the adoption of new tax legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nWe conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those jurisdictions. Due to the complexity of tax laws in those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from tax authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, legislative bodies in the various countries in which we do business may from time to time adopt new tax legislation that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nTo the extent that our customers consolidate, they may reduce purchases of our products and demand more favorable terms and conditions from us, which would harm our revenues and profitability.\nConsolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold. These merged customers could obtain products from a source other than us or demand more favorable terms and conditions from us, which would harm our revenues and profitability. In addition, our significant customers may merge with or acquire our competitors and discontinue their relationships with us.\nRestructuring our workforce can be disruptive and harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to the economic environment, performance issues, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. Restructurings can among other things result in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and, as a result, our operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nOur products may contain defects which may cause us to incur significant costs, divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers.\nOur existing products and any new or enhanced products we introduce may contain undetected software or hardware defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. These problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relation problems or loss of customers and reputation, all of which would harm our results of operations. A successful claim against us for an amount exceeding the coverage limit on our product liability insurance policy would force us to use our own resources, to the extent available, to pay the claim, which could result in an increase in our expenses and a reduction of our working capital available for other uses, thereby harming our profitability and capital resources.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our results of operations and reputation.\nOur success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our ability to establish, protect and maintain our proprietary rights to our intellectual property. We currently rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws, and restrictions on disclosure and use, to establish, protect, and maintain our intellectual property rights. To date, we have relied primarily on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary processes and know-how. We also have patent applications and existing patents in the United States and other jurisdictions. We cannot be certain that any of these applications will be approved or that any such patents, if issued, or our existing patents, will be upheld. We also cannot be certain that our existing patents and any such additional patents, if issued, will be effective in protecting our proprietary technology.\nWe generally enter into assignment of rights and confidentiality agreements with our officers, employees and consultants. We also generally limit access to and distribution of our source code and further limit the disclosure and use of our other proprietary information. However, these measures provide only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may not have signed agreements containing adequate protective provisions in every case, and the contractual provisions that are in place may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances. Any infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors\u2019 offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of one or more competitive advantages, loss of market share and decreased revenues.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, existing trade secret, copyright, patent, and trademark laws afford us only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technologies or to deter others from developing similar technologies. Others may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Further, monitoring the unauthorized use of our products and our intellectual property rights is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation.\nWe have outstanding debt under our Credit Facility and may incur additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nOn March 2, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement establishing a senior secured credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with certain institutional lenders. The amended and restated credit agreement, as amended to date, provides for a (i) term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $40 million, which was advanced to us on March 3, 2015, and (ii) revolving credit facility which was in the original aggregate amount of up to $60 million. Pursuant to amendments to the credit agreement and among other changes effected by such amendments, the maximum aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility was increased from $65 million to $75 million in September 2015 and to $150 million in January 2016. For additional information regarding our March 2015 credit facility, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWhile no amounts are currently outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we may in the future borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility or any other credit facilities that we may obtain and use the proceeds to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and stock repurchases. Increases in our aggregate levels of debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, competitive pressures and adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nIn addition, servicing our existing debt or increases in our aggregate levels of debt will depend on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our existing and any new indebtedness and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as restructuring debt, obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive, or selling assets. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default under current and any future debt obligations. As a result, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with certain covenants under our Credit Facility, any borrowings must be repaid, we may be prevented from further borrowing and/or the Credit Facility may be terminated by the lenders.\nOur Credit Facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The financial covenants in the related credit agreement require us to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio. The credit agreement that provides for our Credit Facility also requires us, among other things, to timely deliver certain financial statements to the lenders. Our failure to comply with such covenants or any other breach of the credit agreement could cause a default under the credit agreement. We may then be required to repay borrowings under the Credit Facility with capital from other sources. We could also be blocked from borrowing or obtaining letters of credit under the Credit Facility, and the credit agreement could be terminated by the lenders. Under these circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. In the event of a default, it is possible that our assets and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets may be attached or seized by the lenders. Any failure by us to comply with the covenants or other provisions of the credit agreement or any difficulty in securing any required future financing and any such seizure or attachment of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock in any equity offering by the Company or upon any conversion of any convertible debt that we may issue in the future would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock in any equity financing by us or upon conversion of any convertible debt we may issue in the future would dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable in any such financing or upon any such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of any convertible debt, if issued in the future, may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of that convertible debt could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.\nWe follow an established investment policy and set of objectives designed to preserve principal and liquidity, to generate a market return given the policy\u2019s guidelines and to avoid certain investment concentrations. The policy also sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one non-government issuer. Our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015 consisted of money market funds and U.S. Treasury, government agency and corporate debt securities.\nThese investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Although our investment portfolio\u2019s amortized cost approximated fair value as of December 31, 2015, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or the future value of our investments. As a result, we can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be impaired in the future and that any such impairment will not materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to changing regulation that has resulted in increased costs and may continue to result in additional costs in the future.\nWe are subject to laws, rules and regulations of federal and state regulatory authorities, including the Nasdaq and financial market entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. In recent years, these entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the Nasdaq, have issued new requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements partly in response to laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) and, more recently, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). Our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of substantial management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nIn particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of SOX and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, have required, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. To the extent that we identify areas of our disclosures controls and procedures and/or internal controls requiring improvement (such as the material weakness that existed as of December 31, 2015, as discussed in Item 9A herein), we may have to incur additional costs and divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nBecause these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.\nWe are also subject to laws, rules and regulations of authorities in other countries where we do business, and these laws, rules and regulations are also subject to change and uncertainty regarding their application and interpretation. The growth of our operations, both domestically and internationally, has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in increased expense, resources and time spent on matters relating to compliance, including monitoring and training activities.\nCompliance with recently adopted rules of the SEC relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may require us and our suppliers to incur substantial expense and may limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals and minerals used in the manufacturing of our products.\nIn 2012, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding the source of certain conflict minerals for issuers for which such conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by that issuer, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. The metals covered by the rules include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, commonly referred to as \u201c3TG.\u201d Because Ixia contracts to manufacture products which may contain tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold, we will be required under these rules to determine whether those minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of our products and, if so, the rules require us to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine if we know or have reason to believe any of the minerals used in the production process may have originated from the DRC or an adjoining country (collectively referred to as \u201ccovered countries\u201d). The time required to be spent by our management and the management of our suppliers in this endeavor could be significant. There may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. There can be no assurance that these costs will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. This may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide products containing conflict free metals, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner or at competitive prices. Our material sourcing is broad based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\nIf we fail to maintain our relationships with industry experts, our products may lose industry and market recognition and sales could decline.\nOur relationships with industry experts, in particular in the field of performance analysis and measurement of networks and network equipment, are critical for maintaining our industry credibility and for developing new products. These experts have established standard testing methodologies that evaluate new network equipment products and technologies. We provide these experts and their testing labs with our products and engineering assistance to perform tests on these new network equipment products and technologies. These industry experts refer to our products in their publications which has given our products industry recognition. In addition, these labs offer us the opportunity to test our products on the newest network equipment and technologies, thereby assisting us in developing new products that are designed to meet evolving technological needs. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our relationships with industry experts or that our competitors will not maintain similar or superior relationships with industry experts. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with industry experts or if competitors have superior relationships with them, our products may lose industry and market recognition which could harm our reputation and competitive position and cause our sales to decline.\nMan-made problems such as cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our business, reputation and operating results.\nOur daily business operations require us to retain sensitive data such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, confidential employee information, and data related to customers, suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure. The ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals, and organizations like Ixia are susceptible to multiple variations of attacks on our networks on a daily basis.\nDespite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could, among other negative consequences, disrupt our operations, harm our reputation and customer relationships, result in claims and litigation against us, and impose on us the costs of investigation, notification, and remediation. Accordingly, any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employee errors or other unforeseen activities. Such issues could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. To the extent that such disruptions occur, they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and, as a result, our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation.\nIn addition, the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruption to the economy and create further uncertainties in the economy. Energy shortages, such as gas or electricity shortages, could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business and operations are subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. A number of our facilities and those of our suppliers, our contract manufacturers, and our customers are located in areas that have been affected by natural disasters such as ice and snow storms, earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes in the past. For example, currently, our corporate headquarters and many of our customers are located in California. California historically has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property. To mitigate some of this risk, certain of our U.S. and international locations are insured up to certain levels against losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes, floods and/or other natural disasters. However, there can be no guarantee that such insurance may be adequate in the event of a natural disaster, and a significant natural disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur use of open source software in our products could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\nMany of our products contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner and then distribute the combined software, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to license that combined software under the terms of that open source license as well as release the source code of the combined software to third parties. This could allow third parties to use our proprietary software at no charge, could enable our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time, and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales and lower revenues for us.\nAlthough we attempt to monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective. Further, there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services, asserting that open source software infringes the claimants\u2019 intellectual property rights. We could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to: (i) seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products; (ii) re-engineer our products; (iii) discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished in a timely manner; (iv) allow third parties to use our products at no charge under the terms of that open source software license; or (v) make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary software; any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, adversely affect our business.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, despite the possible benefits to our shareholders.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Furthermore, some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. Our articles of incorporation include provisions that limit the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and/or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings. These and other provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control despite possible benefits to our shareholders, may discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may harm the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our shareholders.\nOur stock price may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in recent years. The trading price may be subject to future fluctuations in response to, among other events and factors: (i) the global economic environment; (ii) variations in our quarterly operating results; (iii) the gain, loss or timing of significant orders; (iv) changes in earnings estimates by analysts who cover our stock or the stock of our competitors; (v) changes in our revenue and/or earnings guidance as periodically announced in our earnings calls or press releases; (vi) announcements of technological innovations and new products by us or our competitors; (vii) changes in domestic and international economic, political and business conditions; (viii) consolidation and general conditions in our industry; (ix) the announcement of significant transactions, such as a proposed business acquisition; and (x) changes in our executive management team. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies in our industry that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These market fluctuations have affected and may continue to affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88750, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "XXIA"}
