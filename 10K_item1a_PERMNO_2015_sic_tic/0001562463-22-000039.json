{"cik": "1562463", "company": "First Internet Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties\ndescribed below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nBusiness, Strategic, and Reputational Risks\nA failure of, or interruption in, the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Although we have built a level of redundancy into our information technology infrastructure and update our business continuity plan annually, any failure or interruption of our information systems, or the third-party information systems on which we rely, as a result of inadequate or failed processes or systems, human errors or external events, could adversely affect our digital-based operations and slow or temporarily halt the processing of applications, loan servicing, deposit-related transactions, and our general banking operations. In addition, our communication and information systems may present security risks and could be susceptible to hacking or other unauthorized access. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeakness in the economy may disproportionately and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAny economic downturn could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect consumer confidence, a reduction in general business activity and increased market volatility. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Our ability to properly assess the creditworthiness of our customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our credit exposure would be made more complex by difficult market and economic conditions. Accordingly, if market conditions worsen, we may experience increases in foreclosures, delinquencies, write-offs and customer bankruptcies, as well as more restricted access to funds.\nThe competitive nature of the banking and financial services industry could negatively affect our ability to increase or maintain our market share and retain long-term profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is strong. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, fintechs, mutual funds, insurance companies and securities brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and nationwide. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence than we do and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to increase our market share and remain profitable on a long-term basis.\nIn 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that it would begin to accept and evaluate charters for entities that wanted to conduct certain components of a banking business pursuant to a federal charter, known as a \u201cspecial purpose national bank\u201d (\u201cSPNB\u201d) charter. Intended to promote economic opportunity and spur financial innovation, SPNBs may engage in any of the following activities: paying checks, lending money, or taking deposits. If any such applications are granted, recipients of an SPNB charter may enter the U.S. payments market in which the Bank operates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank and certain of its business lines.\nReputational risk and social factors may negatively affect us.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon other external perceptions of our business practices and financial condition. Adverse perceptions could damage our reputation to a level that could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining lending and deposit relationships and accessing equity or credit markets, as well as increased regulatory scrutiny of our business. Adverse developments or perceptions regarding the business practices or financial condition of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also indirectly adversely affect our reputation.\nIn addition, adverse reputational developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships may negatively affect our reputation. All of the above factors may result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that may change or constrain the manner in which we engage with our customers and the products we offer and may also increase our litigation risk. If these risks were to materialize, they could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have and expect to incur substantial costs related to the merger with First Century (the \u201cmerger\u201d) and integration.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, retention, severance and employee benefit-related costs, regulatory fees, closing, integration and other related costs. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the merger is completed.\nThe merger may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe anticipated benefits of the merger, including revenue diversification and growth, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon our operating results following the completion of the merger.\nIn addition, we and First Century have operated and, until the completion of the merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, including employees of First Century, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the Company following the merger.\nBefore the merger and the merger of First Century Bank, N.A. into the Bank may be completed, various approvals, consents, and non-objections must be obtained from the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and other regulatory authorities in the United States. In determining whether to grant these approvals, such regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to an adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approvals; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment generally.\nThe approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations, or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of our business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting our revenues following the merger or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations, or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact the Company.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, there may be various adverse consequences and we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be beneficial and will be completed. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to perform our obligations under the merger agreement.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company and/or First Century. These uncertainties may impair First Century and/or our ability to attract, retain and motivate key\npersonnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with First Century and/or the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with First Century and/or the Company.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include: (i) approval by First Century shareholders; (ii) the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including the approval of the DFI, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve; and (iii) the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, injunction, order, or decree, which shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated, or enforced, which prohibits, prevents, or makes illegal the completion of the merger, and no material claim, litigation or proceeding shall have been initiated and pending or threatened relating to the merger agreement or the merger or seeking to prevent the completion of the merger. Each party\u2019s obligation to complete the merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions. These conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed.\nWe may not have discovered certain liabilities or other matters related to First Century, which may adversely affect the future financial performance of the combined company.\nIn the course of the due diligence review that we conducted prior to the execution of the merger agreement, we may not have discovered, or may have been unable to properly quantify, certain liabilities of First Century or other factors that may have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of the combined company after the consummation of the merger.\nOur estimates and judgments related to the acquisition accounting methods used to record the purchase price allocation related to the merger may be inaccurate.\nOur management will make significant accounting judgments and estimates related to the application of acquisition accounting of the merger under GAAP, as well as the underlying valuation models. Our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted in future periods if the accounting judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate.\nNew lines of business, and new products and services may result in exposure to new risks and the value and earnings related to existing lines of business are subject to market conditions.\nThe Bank has introduced, and in the future, may introduce new products and services to differing markets either alone or in conjunction with third parties, including programs and products introduced as part of our fintech partnership initiatives. New lines of business, products or services could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls or the controls of third parties and could reduce our revenues and potentially generate losses. There are material inherent risks and uncertainties associated with offering new products and services, especially when new markets are not fully developed or when the laws and regulations regarding a new product are not mature. New products and services, or entrance into new markets, may require substantial time, resources and capital, and profitability targets may not be achieved. Factors outside of our control, such as developing laws and regulations, regulatory orders, competitive product offerings and changes in commercial and consumer demand for products or services may also materially impact the successful launch and implementation of new products or services. Failure to manage these risks, or failure of any product or service offerings to be successful and profitable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant external events could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe could experience other external events such as severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war, such as the current conflict in Ukraine, or terrorism or other widespread public health issues or continued circumstances that could impair the ability of our customers to repay outstanding loans; impair the value of collateral, if any, securing outstanding loans; negatively impact our deposit base, loan originations or general demand for our services; cause significant property damage; result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses or losses. We could also be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to external events affecting the places they live. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will completely mitigate the adverse impacts of any significant external event. The occurrence or continuation of any such event could materially adversely impact our business, our ability to provide our services, demand for our services, asset quality, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or other such epidemic, pandemic or outbreak of a highly contagious disease, occurring in the United States or in the geographies in which we conduct operations, could adversely affect our business operations, asset valuations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The COVID-19 pandemic, or outbreak of another highly contagious or infectious disease, could negatively impact the ability of our employees and customers to conduct such transactions and disrupt the business activities and operations of our customers in the geographic areas in which we operate. The spread of the COVID-19 virus had an impact on our operations during fiscal year 2021, and we expect that the virus will continue to have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and those of our customers during 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in the behavior of customers, businesses and their employees, including illness, quarantines, social distancing practices, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment and overall economic and financial market instability. Future effects, including additional actions taken by federal, state, and local governments to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, are unknown. Any sustained disruption to our operations is likely to negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding our contingency and business continuity plans and other safeguards against pandemics or another contagious disease, the spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact the availability of our personnel who are necessary to conduct our business operations, as well as potentially impact the business and operations of our third party service providers who perform critical services for us. If the response to contain COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, is unsuccessful, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business operations, asset valuations, financial condition and results of operations. Material adverse impacts may include all or a combination of allowance for loan losses, income taxes, valuation and impairments of investment securities and goodwill, as well as fair value measurements of derivatives, loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of Indiana law and provisions of our articles of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. We are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under the Indiana Business Corporation Law. Additionally, our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock without shareholder approval and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal.\nAlthough these provisions do not preclude a takeover, they may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or deferring a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his or her best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of our common stock. Such provisions will also render the removal of the Board of Directors and of management more difficult and, therefore, may serve to perpetuate current management. These provisions could potentially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCredit Risks\nOur commercial loan portfolio exposes us to higher credit risks than residential real estate loans, including risks relating to the success of the underlying business and conditions in the market or the economy and concentrations in our commercial loan portfolio.\nOur commercial loans totaled $2.4 billion, or 81.8% of our total loan portfolio. These loans generally involve higher credit risks than residential real estate loans and are dependent upon our lenders maintaining close relationships with the borrowers. Payments on these loans are often dependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying business or assets, and repayment of such loans may be influenced to a great extent by conditions in the market or the economy. Commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances than residential real estate loans and could lead to concentration risks within our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, our C&I, healthcare finance, franchise finance and small business loans have primarily been extended to small to medium sized businesses that generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. Our failure to manage this commercial loan growth and the related risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, with respect to CRE, federal and state banking regulators are examining CRE lending activity with heightened scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of CRE loans to implement more stringent underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and\ncapital levels as a result of CRE lending growth and exposures. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of CRE loans, our banking regulators may require us to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain, which could limit our ability to leverage our capital and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPortions of our commercial lending activities are geographically concentrated in Central Indiana and adjacent markets, and changes in local economic conditions may impact their performance.\nWe offer our residential mortgage and consumer lending as well as public finance, healthcare finance, franchise finance, small business lending and single tenant financing products and services throughout the United States. However, we serve CRE and C&I borrowers primarily in Central Indiana and adjacent markets. Accordingly, the performance of our CRE and C&I lending depends upon demographic and economic conditions in those regions. The profitability of our CRE and C&I loan portfolio may be impacted by changes in those conditions. Additionally, unfavorable local economic conditions could reduce or limit the growth rate of our CRE and C&I loan portfolios for a significant period of time, or otherwise decrease the ability of those borrowers to repay their loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks arising from conditions in the real estate market, as a significant portion of our loans are secured by commercial and residential real estate.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 44.9% of our loans held for investment portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as the primary component of collateral. Our real estate lending activities, and our exposure to fluctuations in real estate collateral values, are significant and may increase as our assets increase. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located, in response to factors such as economic downturns, changes in the economic health of industries heavily concentrated in a particular area and in response to changes in market interest rates, which influence capitalization rates used to value revenue-generating commercial real estate. If the value of real estate serving as collateral for our loans declines materially, a significant part of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized and losses incurred upon borrower defaults would increase. Conditions in certain segments of the real estate industry, including homebuilding, lot development and mortgage lending, may have an effect on values of real estate pledged as collateral for our loans. The inability of purchasers of real estate, including residential real estate, to obtain financing may weaken the financial condition of our borrowers who are dependent on the sale or refinancing of property to repay their loans. Changes in the economic health of certain industries can have a significant impact on other sectors or industries which are directly or indirectly associated with those industries, and may impact the value of real estate in areas where such industries are concentrated.\nThe implementation of CECL, including the design and maintenance of related internal controls over financial reporting, will require a significant amount of time and resources which may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nA new accounting standard adopted by FASB, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or (\u201cCECL\u201d), will require financial institutions, like the Bank, to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan and lease losses beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. Current GAAP requires an incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. CECL will represent a significant change in methodology and may greatly increase the types of data we will need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our financial statements. However, the allowance for loan and lease losses may increase upon the adoption of CECL and any such increased allowance level would decrease shareholders' equity and the Company's and Bank's regulatory capital ratios.\nA significant amount of time and resources may be needed to implement CECL effectively, including the design and implementation of adequate internal controls, which may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting relating to CECL, or otherwise, our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis could also be adversely affected.\nOur active participation in the PPP, or in other relief programs, may expose us to credit losses as well as litigation and compliance risk.\nTo support our customers, businesses, and communities, we have participated in the PPP as a lender. As of December 31, 2021, we had originated 728 loans with balances in excess of $85 million to new and existing customers through the PPP. As of December 31, 2021, only 23 PPP loans, with aggregate outstanding principal balances of $3.15 million, had not been repaid or forgiven. Because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the April 3, 2020 opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the program, which exposes the Company to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. In addition, since the commencement of the PPP, several other banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks followed in accepting and processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation. The Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the program. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Corporation, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Bank. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket, Interest Rate, and Liquidity Risks\nThe market value of some of our investments could decline and adversely affect our financial position.\nIn assessing the impairment of investment securities, we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and whether we have the intent to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. We also use economic models to assist in the valuation of some of our investment securities. If our investment securities experience a decline in value, we would need to determine whether the decline represented an other-than-temporary impairment, in which case we would be required to record a write-down of the investment and a corresponding charge to our earnings.\nAn increase in interest rates, or the replacement of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) with a benchmark rate that is higher or more volatile than LIBOR, could increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d) announced that the Authority intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (together with any successor, \u201cIBA\u201d), as administrator of LIBOR In response to concerns regarding the future of LIBOR, Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) to identify alternatives to LIBOR. The ARRC first recommended a benchmark replacement waterfall that facilitated continued linkage to LIBOR while recognizing that the discontinuation of LIBOR would eventually occur. The initial steps in the ARRC's recommended waterfall referenced variations of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), and the ARRC has since recommended SOFR as the replacement rate for U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR. While market participants were warned that LIBOR may cease to exist after 2021, the IBA announced in early 2021 that it would continue to publish the most widely used tenors of U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR (such as one-month and three-month LIBOR) until June 30, 2023. While the IBA's announcement extended LIBOR's phase-out, there is no current expectation that LIBOR will continue beyond mid-2023, and U.S. banking regulators have issued guidance encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market acceptance as the standard replacement for LIBOR, whether alternative reference rates other than SOFR (such as Ameribor) will gain market traction or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. Further, other central banks and regulators have convened working groups to evaluate other interest rate benchmarks (such as EURIBOR), and it is possible that a transition away from certain of these interest rate benchmarks will occur leading to the establishment of new market accepted reference rates. Uncertainty regarding the market standard replacement for LIBOR, and floating rate benchmarks generally, could have adverse impacts on floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the floating rate features of our outstanding 6.0% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2029 (the \u201c2029 Notes\u201d) are based on LIBOR, while the floating rate features of our 3.75% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated notes due 2031 (the \u201c2031 Notes\u201d) are based on SOFR. In anticipation of LIBOR\u2019s phase out, and the uncertainty of SOFR as a LIBOR replacement, the terms of our 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes provide for a benchmark replacement rate for LIBOR or SOFR, as applicable, with such benchmark replacement rate to be determined by the Company or an independent financial advisor appointed by the Company, as applicable, in each case in accordance with terms of the 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes, respectively. There can be no assurance that any replacement benchmark rate for our 2029 Notes or 2031 Notes will be determined or agreed upon, as applicable, before experiencing adverse effects due to changes in interest rates, if at all. We will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur. Accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out of LIBOR, or the unavailability of any other interest rate benchmarks such as SOFR or EURIBOR, on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Bank may not be able to pay us dividends.\nThe ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by state and federal law and depends generally on the Bank\u2019s ability to generate net income. If we are unable to comply with applicable provisions of these statutes and regulations, the Bank may not be able to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to pay dividends on our outstanding common stock and our ability to service our debt may be materially impaired.\nWe may need additional capital resources in the future, and these capital resources may not be available when needed or at all, without which our financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially impaired.\nIn recent years, we have raised additional capital in the public debt and equity markets to support balance sheet growth, refinance existing debt obligations, or explore strategic alternatives which may include additional asset, deposit or revenue generation channels. Our ability to raise future capital, if needed, will depend upon our financial performance and conditions in the capital markets, as well as economic conditions generally. Accordingly, such financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nBecause our business is highly dependent on technology that is subject to rapid change and transformation, we are subject to risks of obsolescence.\nThe Bank conducts its deposit gathering activities and a significant portion of its residential mortgage lending activities through digital channels. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and we face constant evolution of customer demand for technology-driven financial and banking products and services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvement and product development, marketing and implementation. Any failure to successfully keep pace with and fund technological innovation in the markets in which we compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our management team and could be adversely affected by the unexpected loss of key officers.\nOur future success and profitability are substantially dependent upon our management and the abilities of our senior executives. We believe that our future results will also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified management. Competition for senior personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the loss of our chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business and lead to unauthorized disclosure of customers\u2019 personal information, theft or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage to our reputation, and increases in our costs or financial losses.\nWe depend upon our ability to process, record and monitor our client transactions on a continuous basis. As customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding data privacy and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities, may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger-scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of digital technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use smartphones, tablets, personal computers and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\nThird parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, like other companies, we and our vendors face a wide range of ongoing cyber threats that include phishing emails and social engineering schemes, ransomware threats, and criminal re-use of credentials sold on the dark web. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such material losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, company data, networks, and customer information from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services, could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, breach investigation and notification expenses, reputational damage, claims or litigation, reimbursement or other compensation costs and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, which could restrain our growth and profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations, and the supervisory framework that oversees the administration of these laws and regulations, are primarily intended to protect depositors, the DIF and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. These laws and regulations, among other matters, affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth. Compliance with the myriad laws and regulations applicable to our organization can be difficult and costly. In addition, these laws, regulations and policies are subject to continual review by governmental authorities, and changes to these laws, regulations and policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of these laws, regulations and policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and often impose additional compliance costs. Further, any new laws, rules and\nregulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive. All of these laws and regulations, and the supervisory framework applicable to our industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the DFI periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal or state banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase, which would reduce our profitability.\nThe deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by its risk classification, which is based on a number of factors, including regulatory capital levels, asset growth and asset quality. High levels of bank failures during and following the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the DIF. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDIC may increase deposit insurance assessment rates and may charge a special assessment to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe long-term impact of regulatory capital rules is uncertain and a significant increase in our capital requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nIn order to remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d, the Basel III Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain: (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d (resulting in a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 7.0%); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%); (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum Total capital ratio of 10.5%); and (iv) a minimum Leverage Ratio of 4.0%.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for both the Company and the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to evolving and expensive regulations and requirements. Our failure to adhere to these requirements or the failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could seriously harm our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation as a financial institution and are also required to follow the corporate governance and financial reporting practices and policies required of a company whose stock is registered under the Exchange Act and listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Compliance with these requirements means we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Compliance also requires a significant diversion of management time and attention, particularly with regard to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Although we have reviewed, and will continue to review, our disclosure controls and procedures in order to determine whether they are effective, our controls and procedures may not be able to prevent errors or frauds in the future. Faulty judgments, simple errors or mistakes, or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established controls and procedures may make it difficult for us to ensure that the objectives of the control system will be met. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect other than inconsequential errors or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nWe face risk under the BSA and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations, as well as general fund transfer and payments-related risk.\nThe BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, financial institutions, including ourselves, bear fund transfer risks of different types which result from large transaction volumes and large dollar amounts of incoming and outgoing money transfers. Loss exposure may result if money is transferred from the Bank before it is received, or legal rights to reclaim monies transferred are asserted. Such exposure results from payments which are made to merchants for payment clearing, while customers have statutory periods to reverse their payments. It also results from funds transfers made prior to receipt of offsetting funds, as accommodations to customers. Transfers could also be made in error. Additionally, as with other financial institutions, we may incur legal liability or reputational risk, if we unknowingly process payments for companies in violation of money laundering laws or regulations or immoral activities.\nThe merger and our introduction of new products and programs in partnership with fintechs is expected to increase account and transaction volume at the Bank and thereby increase the foregoing risks, the results of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to potential liability and business risk from actions by our regulators related to supervision of third parties.\nOur regulators or auditors may require us to increase the level and manner of our oversight of the third parties which provide marketing and other services through which we offer products and services, whether in connection with the merger, our introduction of new programs and products, or otherwise. Although we have significant compliance staff and have used outside consultants, our internal and external compliance examiners continually evaluate our practices and must be satisfied with the results of our third-party oversight activities. We cannot assure you that we will satisfy all related requirements. Not maintaining a compliance management system which is deemed adequate could result in sanctions against the Bank. Our ongoing review and analysis of our compliance management system and implementation of any changes resulting from that review and analysis will likely result in increased non-interest expense.\nFederal banking laws limit the acquisition and ownership of our common stock.\nBecause we are a bank holding company, any purchaser of certain specified amounts of our common stock may be required to file a notice with or obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA, as amended, and the Change in\nBank Control Act of 1978, as amended. Specifically, under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, (1) any other bank holding company may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring 5% or more of our common stock and (2) any person may be required to file a notice with and not be disapproved by the Federal Reserve to acquire 10% or more of our common stock and will be required to file a notice with and not be disapproved by the Federal Reserve to acquire 25% or more of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13797, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "INBK"}
