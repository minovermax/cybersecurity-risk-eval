{"cik": "1449732", "company": "Willbros Group, Inc.\\NEW\\", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur merger with Primoris may not be completed. Due to our substantial liquidity concerns, if we are unable to complete the merger, we would likely need to seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may harm our business and place stockholders at significant risk of losing all, or substantially all, of their investment.\nOn March 27, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Primoris and Merger Sub, pursuant to which we would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Primoris. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of our common stock, other than shares owned by us or one of our subsidiaries, and shares owned by stockholders who have exercised their rights as dissenting owners under Delaware law, will be automatically converted into the right to receive $0.60 per share in cash, without interest (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d).\nOn March 27, 2018, we also entered into the ABL Forbearance Agreement, the Term Forbearance Agreement (collectively, the \u201cForbearance Agreements\u201d), and the Seventh Amendment, which are more fully discussed under Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties under the caption \u201cCurrent Developments\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreements, we have acknowledged that certain specified defaults and events of default have occurred and are continuing or will occur under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement and 2013 ABL Credit Facility. The Forbearance Agreements further provide that the administrative agents and lenders under such credit agreements will forbear from exercising their rights and remedies under the respective credit agreements and other related loan documents that arise solely as a result of the specified defaults for a limited period expiring on the earlier of (i) July 31, 2018 or the closing of the Merger Agreement, in the case of the ABL Forbearance Agreement, and August 15, 2018 or the closing of the Merger Agreement, in the case of the Term Forbearance Agreement, or (ii) the occurrence of any one of several specified termination events, including, among other things, the termination of the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, Primoris has agreed to make a loan to us in a principal amount of $10.0 million under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement no earlier than three business days after the effective date of the Seventh Amendment and may agree to make additional loans to us in an aggregate amount not to exceed $10.0 million.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that we, Primoris and Merger Sub will use each of their respective reasonable best efforts, subject to certain exceptions, to, among other things, consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable and make all required filings and obtain all required consents, registrations, permits, regulatory approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods.\nConsummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, including, among others, customary conditions relating to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of our stockholders and any applicable filings with or authorizations, consents or waivers from third parties. The obligation of each party to consummate the merger is also conditioned on the other parties\u2019 representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other parties having performed in all material respects its obligations and complied in all material respects with the agreements and covenants under the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains termination rights for each of us and Primoris, including, among others, if the merger has not been consummated by August 15, 2018. Either party may also terminate the Merger Agreement if the requisite vote of our stockholders has not been obtained at a duly convened meeting of our stockholders or an order permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger becomes final and non-appealable. Primoris may also terminate the Merger Agreement if any default or event of default occurs under our 2013 ABL Credit Facility or 2014 Term Credit Agreement (other than specified defaults which are the subject of the Forbearance Agreements), or if any forbearance set forth in either of the Forbearance Agreements ceases to be effective.\nOur continuing failure to comply with financial covenants and other covenants, our inability to extend or refinance our 2013 ABL Credit Facility and our continuing liquidity issues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, notwithstanding the temporary forbearance provided under the Forbearance Agreements and the short-term liquidity provided by Primoris under the Seventh Amendment. If we are unable to complete the merger, our indebtedness under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement and 2013 ABL Credit Facility will become due, and we will likely need to seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy laws.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could adversely affect competing proposals to acquire us. These provisions include the prohibition on us generally from soliciting any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction. These provisions may discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our company from considering or proposing an acquisition, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the current proposed Merger Consideration.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the outcome of the merger may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause our customers, suppliers and vendors to seek to change existing business relationships, cease doing business with us or delay doing business with us until the merger has been successfully completed. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or compensation structure. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, our business prior to the merger could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking various specified actions until the merger is completed or terminated without the consent of Primoris. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nThe NYSE has commenced proceedings to delist our common stock. Since our common stock is not listed on any other national securities exchange, it will likely be more difficult for stockholders and investors to sell our common stock or to obtain accurate quotations of the share price of our common stock.\nAs a result of our failure to maintain certain standards for continued listing on the NYSE, on March 27, 2018, the NYSE announced that it has suspended trading of our common stock effective immediately, based on its determination that the trading price of our common stock was \u201cabnormally low,\u201d and its decision to commence delisting proceedings. We expect the NYSE will file a Form 25 to delist our common stock and that our delisting will become effective in the near future. Due to the suspension of trading and likely delisting, our common stock has begun trading over-the-counter.\nStocks trading on the over-the-counter market are typically less liquid than stocks that trade on a national securities exchange. Trading on the over-the-counter market may also negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the liquidity of our common stock may be impaired, not only in the number of shares that are bought and sold, but also through delays in the timing of transactions, and coverage by security analysts and the news media, if any, of us. Stockholders may find it difficult to resell their shares of our common stock, due to the delisting. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE may also result in other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence by customers, suppliers, vendors and employees, and loss of institutional investor interest in our common stock.\nWe may not be able to compete for, or work on, certain projects if we are not able to obtain any necessary bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financial assurances.\nOur contracts may require that we provide to our customers security for the performance of their projects in the form of bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurances. Changes in our sureties\u2019 assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid or performance bonds for our work. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding or letters of credit, our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and lenders and finding more business that does not require bonds or allows for other form of collateral for project performance, such as cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances. Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds.\nWe are currently experiencing an interruption in the availability of our bonding capacity due to our current balance sheet and overall financial condition, and, as a result, we are unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by electric power and oil and gas companies on infrastructure.\nOur revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major construction projects. The availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the electric power and oil and gas industries and, specifically, the level of capital expenditures of electric power and oil and gas companies on infrastructure. Our failure to obtain major projects, the delay in awards of major projects, the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the under-utilization of our resources, which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow. Numerous factors beyond our control influence the level of capital expenditures of these companies, including:\n\u2022\ncurrent and projected electric power and oil and gas prices;\n\u2022\nthe demand for electricity and gasoline;\n\u2022\nthe abilities of electric power and oil and gas companies to generate, access and deploy capital;\n\u2022\nregulatory restraints on the rates that electric power companies may charge their customers;\n\u2022\nexploration, production and transportation costs;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate and location of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions;\n\u2022\nlocal and international political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which could impede our growth.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. A substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals. We compete for these projects against companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In some markets, there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price. Our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies. Our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures, greater resources or other advantages and, therefore, may be able to provide their services at lower rates than ours or elect to place bids on projects that drive down margins to lower levels than we would accept.\nWe have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in prior fiscal years. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis. As a result, our business, operating results and liquidity could be harmed.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that led to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, most recently for the first three quarters of 2011 and the first two quarters of 2014. We also identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, 2011, and 2010 and for the years 2004 through 2007. We believe that all of these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud, even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements.\nA pending securities class action against us has resulted in significant costs and expenses, has diverted resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows if a preliminary settlement does not receive final approval.\nWe have reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated securities class action that had been filed in 2014 against us and two of our former Chief Executive Officers and our former Chief Financial Officer. The settlement, if approved by the Court, will be funded by our insurance carriers and will include the dismissal of all claims against defendants.\nAs further described in Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, this securities class action was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of\na class of purchasers of our stock alleging damages on their behalf after we announced that we would be restating our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014. This matter has resulted in significant costs and expenses, has diverted resources and if the settlement is not approved by the Court could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur use of fixed-price contracts could adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenue is currently generated by fixed-price contracts. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon a defined scope, which includes specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur, our margins will decrease, and we may incur a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a fixed-price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions such as highly unusual weather patterns or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract. If we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed-price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. This risk is a result of the long-term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts, whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract.\nIn addition, our Utility T&D and Canada segments also generate substantial revenue under unit-price contracts under which we have agreed to perform identified units of work for an agreed price, which have similar associated risks as those identified above for fixed-price contracts. A \u201cunit\u201d can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation. The resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit. Failure to accurately estimate the costs of completing a particular project could result in reduced profits or losses.\nPercentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in adjustments that would materially affect our operating results.\nWe recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method on long-term fixed-price contracts. Under this method, estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage-of-completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised. These estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience and are only estimates. Variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue, we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.\nWe cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, project cancellations, terminations or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn. Many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them, in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits. Therefore, project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits.\nManaging backlog in our Utility T&D segment also has other challenges. Backlog for anticipated projects in this segment is determined based on recurring historical trends, seasonal demand and projected customer needs, but the agreements in this segment rarely have minimum volume or spending obligations, and many of the contracts may be terminated by the customers on short notice. For projects in this segment that are canceled after we have commenced work, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues included in our backlog.\nLegislative or regulatory actions relating to electricity transmission and renewable energy may impact the demand for our services.\nCurrent and potential legislative or regulatory actions may impact demand for our services. Certain legislation or regulations require utilities to meet reliability standards and encourage installation of new electric transmission and renewable energy generation facilities. However, it is unclear whether these initiatives will create sufficient incentives for projects or result in increased demand for our services.\nWhile many states have mandates in place that require specified percentages of electricity to be generated from renewable sources, states could reduce those mandates or make them optional, which could reduce, delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states. Additionally, renewable energy may require additional power generation sources as a backup. The locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and may not be viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport the electricity to demand centers is economically feasible. Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available. These factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects and a delay in the construction of these projects and the related infrastructure, which could negatively impact our business.\nSeasonal variations and inclement weather may cause fluctuations in our operating results, profitability, cash flow and working capital needs related to our operating segments.\nA significant portion of our business in each of our operating segments is performed outdoors. Consequently, our results of operations are exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather. In particular, our Utility T&D segment revenue and profitability often decrease during the winter months and during severe weather conditions because work performed during these periods is more costly to complete. During periods of peak electric power demand in the summer, utilities generally are unable to remove their electric power T&D equipment from service, decreasing the demand for our maintenance services during such periods. The seasonality of this segment\u2019s business also causes our working capital needs to fluctuate. Because this segment\u2019s operating cash flow is usually lower during and immediately following the winter months, we typically experience a need to finance a portion of this segment\u2019s working capital during the spring and summer. Conversely, our Canada segment typically posts its strongest results during the winter and summer months and weaker results during what is known as the \u201cSpring breakup,\u201d when road bans and load limits are put in place and workers are often furloughed and equipment idled. Severe weather can also create demand for restoration of storm damage to overhead utility lines, which can offer opportunities for high margin emergency restoration work for our Utility T&D segment.\nOur failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional costs, both direct and indirect. These claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent on a limited number of key clients.\nWe operate primarily in the power and oil and gas industries, providing services to a limited number of clients. Much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients. The loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations. One client was responsible for approximately 25.0 percent of total contract revenue from continuing operations in 2017. This client was also responsible for 37.5 percent of our 12-month backlog and 29.0 percent of our total backlog at December 31, 2017.\nTerrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, our ability to raise capital or secure insurance or our future growth.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations. In addition, future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating both outside and inside the United States. Further, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These developments may subject our operations to increased risks and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to a number of operational risks.\nOur business operations include a wide range of services in electric power and natural gas transmission and distribution, along with pipeline construction, fabrication and pipeline rehabilitation services. We may encounter difficulties that impact our ability to complete a project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. These difficulties may be the result of delays in designs, engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from our customer\u2019s failure to timely obtain permits or rights-of-way or meet other regulatory requirements, weather-related delays, delays caused by difficult worksite environments and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We also may encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of electric transmission lines, pipelines or other facilities, especially those which are located in environmentally or culturally sensitive areas and more heavily populated areas. We may not be able to recover the costs we incur that are caused by delays. In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations, and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.\nOur operations also involve a number of operational hazards. Natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, equipment and the environment and suspension of operations. In locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others, our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination. The occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage, loss of revenue, casualty loss, increased costs and significant liability to third parties.\nThe insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. An enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, can affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover.\nWorkplace safety is important to us, our employees and our customers. As a result, we maintain comprehensive safety programs and training to all applicable employees throughout our organization. While we focus on protecting people and property, our work is performed at construction sites and in industrial facilities, and our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing these services. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level.\nAlthough we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to adequately train and equip our employees, we have experienced serious accidents, including fatalities, in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors.\nSome of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties. In addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work, where work is performed through a joint venture, we also have potential liability for the work performed by the joint venture itself. In these projects, even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget, we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of the joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications.\nWe act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor, we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract certain specialized activities such as hazardous waste removal, nondestructive inspection and catering and security. However, with respect to other contracts, including those in our Utility T&D segment, we may choose to subcontract a substantial portion of the project. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance\nof the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as a prime contractor, we are subject to the risks associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated.\nWe are self-insured against many potential liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability, general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employee group health claims, many of those policies are subject to substantial deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. Since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectively self-insured for the overwhelming majority of claims. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and noncurrent liabilities. The determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.\nOur operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities.\nOur U.S. and Canadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent. We regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Part of the business in our Utility T&D segment is performed in the southwestern U.S. where there is a greater risk of fines, work stoppages or other sanctions for disturbing Native American artifacts and archeological sites. Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. In addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed.\nWe own and operate several properties in the United States and Canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released. Any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), the Resource Compensation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) and/or analogous state, provincial or local laws. CERCLA imposes joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment, while RCRA governs the generation, storage, transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes. Under these or similar laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property. The expenses related to this work could have a significant impact on our future results.\nWe are unable to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments.\nRecent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d may be contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced and/or issued in the United States (as well as other parts of the world) that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. In June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and to seek negotiations to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or a separate agreement. Moreover, the EPA may or may not continue developing regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. Even if federal efforts in this area slow, states may continue pursuing climate regulations. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us or our customers to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions controls, to obtain emission allowances or to pay emission taxes, and reduce demand for our services.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our executive management.\nOur success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management. Our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships. Our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients, stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management team. We do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals.\nIn the past few years, we have experienced significant turnover at the senior management level. We believe that we currently have in place competitive compensation programs. However, the loss or interruption of services provided by one or more of our senior officers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur ability to maintain our productivity and improve profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our strategy.\nWe contribute to multi-employer plans that could result in liabilities to us if those plans are terminated or we withdraw from those plans.\nWe contribute to several multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan in the event of the employer\u2019s withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. In addition, if the funding of any of these multi-employer plans becomes in \u201ccritical status\u201d under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans.\nA number of plans to which our business units contribute or may contribute in the future are in \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. Certain of these plans may require additional contributions, generally in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans. The amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks.\nThreats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Cybersecurity attacks could include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of our data and personal information, loss of our intellectual property, other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable. The occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are not aware that any material cybersecurity breaches have occurred to date.\nOur settlements with the DOJ and the SEC may negatively impact us in the event of a future FCPA violation. Our failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn May 2008, after reaching agreement with the Company, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) filed an Information and Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) concluding its investigation into violations of the FCPA by Willbros Group, Inc. and its subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc. Also in May 2008, we reached a final settlement with the SEC to resolve its previously disclosed investigations of possible violations of the FCPA and possible violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These investigations stemmed primarily from our former operations in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nigeria. We made the final payments under these settlements in October 2011. The criminal information associated with the DPA was dismissed, with prejudice, on April 2, 2012. Currently, we have no employees working outside of the United States and Canada.\nUnder the SEC settlement, we are permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws.\nOur failure to abide by the FCPA and other laws could result in prosecution and other regulatory sanctions and severely impact our operations. A criminal conviction for violations of the FCPA could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties and equitable remedies, including profit disgorgement and injunctive relief, and would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are likely to continue in the future, and you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid by you.\nThe market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe risk factors described in this Item 1A;\n\u2022\na shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industries generally;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in our customers\u2019 industries; and\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the securities markets.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover, which may adversely affect the performance of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, which may adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\ndeny stockholders the ability to take action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or President; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and to approve the issuance of new series of preferred stock.\nOn June 1, 2017, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation pursuant to which, beginning with the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, the board of directors will cease to be classified and all directors will be elected annually for terms of one year.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, either by us, a member of management or a major stockholder, or the perception that these sales could occur, may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur future sale of common stock, preferred stock, warrants or convertible securities may lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding stock.\nOur authorized shares of common stock consist of 105 million shares. The issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would result in further dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing stockholders. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, one million shares of preferred stock, which may give other stockholders dividend, conversion, voting and liquidation rights, among other rights, which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. While our Board of Directors has no present intention of authorizing the issuance of any such preferred stock, it reserves the right to do so in the future.\nOur business could be negatively affected by the actions of activist stockholders.\nResponding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Furthermore, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.", "PERMNO": 83834, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "WGRP"}
