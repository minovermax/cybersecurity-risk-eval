{"cik": "1104485", "company": "NORTHERN OIL & GAS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Industry\nOur business and operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe spread of COVID-19 caused, and is continuing to cause, severe disruptions in the worldwide and U.S. economy, including the global and domestic decreased demand for oil and natural gas, which has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The continued spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel and adequate staffing for us and our operating partners to conduct business. If COVID-19 continues to spread or the response to contain the COVID-19 pandemic is unsuccessful, we could continue to experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe duration and extent to which the COVID-19 crisis and oil price volatility adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by foreign and domestic governmental authorities and other third parties in response. Volatility in commodity prices has had an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and on the level at which we are able to hedge our anticipated future production, which could continue to materially and adversely affect us, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of this situation on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe foregoing has had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. These factors will likely have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, some impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent oil market developments that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, include:\n\u2022significantly reduced prices for our oil production, resulting from a world-wide decrease in demand for hydrocarbons and a resulting oversupply of existing production;\n\u2022further decreases in the demand for our oil production, resulting from significantly decreased levels of global, regional and local travel as a result of federal, state and local government-imposed quarantines, including shelter-in-place mandates, enacted to slow the spread of the coronavirus;\n\u2022significantly reduced development activity on our properties by operators in the Willison Basin;\n\u2022increased likelihood that the operators of our wells will curtail or shut-in production, either voluntarily or as a result of third-party and regulatory mandates, due to depressed oil prices, lack of storage, and/or other market, social, legal, or political forces;\n\u2022increased costs associated with, or actual unavailability of, facilities for the storage of oil, gas and NGL production, in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022increased operational difficulties associated with, or an inability to, deliver oil and NGLs to end-markets, resulting from pipeline and storage constraints;\n\u2022the potential for loss of leasehold or asset value for failure to produce oil and gas in paying quantities;\n\u2022increased third-party credit risk resulting from adverse market conditions, a lack of access to capital and storage, and the failure of certain of our counterparties to continue as going concerns;\n\u2022increased costs, either directly or indirectly, related to facility modifications, social distancing measures or other best practices implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and or due to changes in federal, state, and local laws and regulations;\n\u2022reducing estimated volumes and value attributable to our proved reserves;\n\u2022reducing carrying value of our oil and gas properties due to recognizing impairments on such properties; and\n\u2022limiting access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and long-term debt.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and recent commodity market developments may also affect our business, operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present a significant risk to our business, operations or financial condition.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Extended declines in oil and natural gas prices have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe oil and natural gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated significantly, including periods of rapid and material decline, in recent years. The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our production, revenue, cash flows, profitability, reserve bookings and access to capital. Although we seek to mitigate volatility and potential declines in commodity prices through derivative arrangements that hedge a portion of our expected production, this merely seeks to mitigate (not eliminate) these risks, and such activities come with their own risks.\nThe prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the actions of OPEC and other major oil producing countries;\n\u2022worldwide and regional economic, political and social conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, which may be driven by various risks including war, terrorism, political unrest, or health epidemics (such as the global COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in early 2020);\n\u2022the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022political and economic conditions, including embargoes, in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activity;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas exploration, production activity and inventories;\n\u2022changes in U.S. energy policy;\n\u2022weather conditions and outbreak of disease;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental taxes, tariffs and/or regulations;\n\u2022proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022the price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas in captive market areas; and\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict oil and natural gas prices. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices, such as the significant and rapid decline that occurred in 2020, has resulted in and could result in future impairments of our proved oil and natural gas properties and may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. To the extent commodity prices received from production are insufficient to fund planned capital expenditures, we may be required to reduce spending or borrow or issue additional equity to cover any such shortfall. Lower oil and natural gas prices may limit our ability to comply with the covenants under our revolving credit facility (or other debt instruments) and/or limit our ability to access borrowing availability thereunder, which is dependent on many factors including the value of our proved reserves.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operators\u2019 drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that they will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil or natural gas can be uneconomical, not only from dry holes, but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to be commercially viable. In addition, drilling and producing operations on our acreage may be curtailed, delayed or canceled by our operators as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022declines in oil or natural gas prices, as occurred in 2020 in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022infrastructure limitations, such as the gas gathering and processing constraints experienced in the Williston Basin in 2019;\n\u2022the high cost, shortages or delays of equipment, materials and services;\n\u2022unexpected operational events, pipeline ruptures or spills, adverse weather conditions, facility malfunctions or title problems;\n\u2022compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022regulations, restrictions, moratoria and bans on hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022unusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as oil, natural gas or well fluids spills or releases, pipeline or tank ruptures and discharges of toxic gas;\n\u2022fires, blowouts, craterings and explosions;\n\u2022uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; and\n\u2022pipeline capacity curtailments.\nIn addition to causing curtailments, delays and cancellations of drilling and producing operations, many of these events can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination, loss of wells and regulatory penalties. We ordinarily maintain insurance against various losses and liabilities arising from our operations; however, insurance against all operational risks is not available to us. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could therefore occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to declines in oil and natural gas prices, we have taken significant writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties. We may be required to record further writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties.\nIn 2020, we were required to write down the carrying value of certain of our oil and natural gas properties, and further writedowns could be required in the future. Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization (without regard to estimates of fair value), or estimated fair value, if lower, of unproved properties that are subject to amortization. Should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling, an impairment would be recognized. Depending on future commodity price levels, the trailing twelve-month average price used in the ceiling calculation may decline, which could cause additional future write downs of our oil and natural gas properties. In addition to commodity prices, our production rates, levels of proved reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nDetermining the amount of oil and natural gas recoverable from various formations involves significant complexity and uncertainty. No one can measure underground accumulations of oil or natural gas in an exact way. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and/or natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, and operating, exploration and development costs. Some of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history and are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate.\nWe routinely make estimates of oil and natural gas reserves in connection with managing our business and preparing reports to our lenders and investors. We make these reserve estimates using various assumptions, including assumptions as to oil and natural gas prices, development schedules, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Some of these assumptions are inherently subjective, and the accuracy of our reserve estimates relies in part on the ability of our management team, reserve engineers and other advisors to make accurate assumptions. Any significant variance from these assumptions by actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based result in the actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent reports we file with the SEC or other company materials.\nOur future success depends on our ability to replace reserves that our operators produce.\nBecause the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, our future success depends upon our ability to economically find or acquire and produce additional oil and natural gas reserves. Except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced. We have added significant net wells and production from wellbore-only acquisitions, where we don\u2019t hold the underlying leasehold interest that would entitle us to participate in future wells. Future oil and natural gas production, therefore, is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost.\nWe may acquire significant amounts of unproved property to further our development efforts. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We seek to acquire both proved and producing properties as well as undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance growth potential and increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all of these properties will contain economically viable reserves or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved reserves or undeveloped acreage that we acquire will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled on our properties will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investments in our properties and reserves.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved reserves.\nWe base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves using a specified pricing and cost assumptions. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as the volume, pricing and duration of our oil and natural gas hedging contracts; actual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs; our actual operating costs in producing oil, natural gas and NGLs; the amount and timing of our capital expenditures; the amount and timing of actual production; and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on third party transportation and processing facilities and other assets that are owned by third parties.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems, processing facilities, oil trucking fleets and rail transportation assets owned by third parties. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities, whether as a result of proration, physical damage, scheduled maintenance, legal or other reasons such as suspension of service due to legal challenges (see below regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline), could result in a substantial increase in costs, declines in realized commodity prices, the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties. During 2019 and into 2020, we experienced significant delays and production curtailments, and declines in realized natural gas prices, that we believe were due in part to gas gathering and processing constraints in the Williston Basin. The negative effects arising from these and similar circumstances may last for an extended period of time. In many cases, operators are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. In addition, our wells may be drilled in locations that are serviced to a limited extent, if at all, by gathering and transportation pipelines, which may or may not have sufficient capacity to transport production from all of the wells in the area. As a result, we rely on third party oil trucking to transport a significant portion of our production to third party transportation pipelines, rail loading facilities and other market access points.\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline (\u201cDAPL\u201d), a major pipeline running out of the Williston Basin, is subject to ongoing litigation (the \u201cDAPL Litigation\u201d) that could threaten its continued operation. In July 2020, a federal district court ordered DAPL to be shut down no later than August 6, 2020, pending the completion of an environmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) that is expected to take at least a year to complete. The district court\u2019s shut-down order was subsequently temporarily stayed by a federal circuit court of appeals, and DAPL currently remains operational. However, in January 2021, a federal circuit court of appeals agreed with the federal district court that the government should have conducted an EIS before going forward with the pipeline, and vacated easements granted for its construction to cross beneath Lake Oahe, a reservoir along the Missouri River maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cUSACE\u201d). The federal circuit court of appeals did not agree with the lower court\u2019s decision that the pipeline should be shut down, and instead left the decision on how to proceed to the USACE. A shut-down remains possible, and there is no guarantee that DAPL will be permitted to resume or continue operations following the completion of the EIS and/or the DAPL Litigation. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or the unavailability of sufficient third party trucking or rail capacity, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established or operations are commenced on units containing the acreage or the leases are extended.\nA significant portion of our acreage is not currently held by production or held by operations. Unless production in paying quantities is established or operations are commenced on units containing these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to participate in the development of the related properties. Drilling plans for these areas are generally in the discretion of third party operators and are subject to change\nbased on various factors that are beyond our control, such as: the availability and cost of capital, equipment, services and personnel; seasonal conditions; regulatory and third party approvals; oil, NGL and natural gas prices; results of title work; gathering system and other transportation constraints; drilling costs and results; and production costs. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that we had leases that were not developed that represented 4,947 net acres potentially expiring in 2021, 6,923 net acres potentially expiring in 2022, 3,152 net acres potentially expiring in 2023, 1,083 net acres potentially expiring in 2024, and 2,774 net acres potentially expiring in 2025 and beyond.\nSeasonal weather conditions adversely affect operators\u2019 ability to conduct drilling activities in the areas where our properties are located.\nSeasonal weather conditions can limit drilling and producing activities and other operations in our operating areas and as a result, a majority of the drilling on our properties is generally performed during the summer and fall months. These seasonal constraints can pose challenges for meeting well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the summer and fall months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations. Additionally, many municipalities impose weight restrictions on the paved roads that lead to jobsites due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws. This could limit access to jobsites and operators\u2019 ability to service wells in these areas.\nAs a non-operator, our development of successful operations relies extensively on third-parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nWe have only participated in wells operated by third parties. The success of our business operations depends on the timing of drilling activities and success of our third-party operators. If our operators are not successful in the development, exploitation, production and exploration activities relating to our leasehold interests, or are unable or unwilling to perform, our financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.\nThese risks are heightened in a low commodity price environment, which may present significant challenges to our operators. The challenges and risks faced by our operators may be similar to or greater than our own, including with respect to their ability to service their debt, remain in compliance with their debt instruments and, if necessary, access additional capital. Commodity prices and/or other conditions have in the past and may in the future cause oil and gas operators to file for bankruptcy. The insolvency of an operator of any of our properties, the failure of an operator of any of our properties to adequately perform operations or an operator\u2019s breach of applicable agreements could reduce our production and revenue and result in our liability to governmental authorities for compliance with environmental, safety and other regulatory requirements, to the operator\u2019s suppliers and vendors and to royalty owners under oil and gas leases jointly owned with the operator or another insolvent owner. Finally, an operator of our properties may have the right, if another non-operator fails to pay its share of costs because of its insolvency or otherwise, to require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party\u2019s share of costs.\nOur operators will make decisions in connection with their operations (subject to their contractual and legal obligations to other owners of working interests), which may not be in our best interests. We may have no ability to exercise influence over the operational decisions of our operators, including the setting of capital expenditure budgets and drilling locations and schedules. Dependence on our operators could prevent us from realizing our target returns for those locations. The success and timing of development activities by our operators will depend on a number of factors that will largely be outside of our control, including, oil and natural gas prices and other factors generally affecting industry operating environment; the timing and amount of capital expenditures; their expertise and financial resources; approval of other participants in drilling wells; selection of technology; and the rate of production of reserves, if any.\nThe inability of one or more of our operating partners to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, which operating partners market on our behalf to energy marketing companies, refineries and their affiliates. We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with a limited number of operating partners. This concentration may impact our overall credit risk since these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. A low commodity price environment may strain our operating partners, which could heighten this risk. The inability or failure of our operating partners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe could experience periods of higher costs as activity levels fluctuate or if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce our profitability, cash flow, and ability to complete development activities as planned.\nAn increase in commodity prices or other factors could result in increased development activity and investment in our areas of operations, which may increase competition for and cost of equipment, labor and supplies. Shortages of, or increasing costs for, experienced drilling crews and equipment, labor or supplies could restrict our operating partners\u2019 ability to conduct desired or expected operations. In addition, capital and operating costs in the oil and natural gas industry have generally risen during periods of increasing commodity prices as producers seek to increase production in order to capitalize on higher commodity prices. In situations where cost inflation exceeds commodity price inflation, our profitability and cash flow, and our operators\u2019 ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget, may be negatively impacted. Any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could reduce our revenues and cash flows.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nApproximately 31% of our estimated net proved reserves volumes were classified as proved undeveloped as of December 31, 2020. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nOur acquisition strategy will subject us to certain risks associated with the inherent uncertainty in evaluating properties for which we have limited information.\nWe intend to expand our operations in part through acquisitions, including without limitation the pending Reliance Acquisition. Our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. Also, our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not economically feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections are often not performed on properties being acquired, and environmental matters, such as subsurface contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Any acquisition involves other potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022the validity of our assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues and costs;\n\u2022a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022the ultimate value of any contingent consideration agreed to be paid in an acquisition;\n\u2022dilution to shareholders if we use equity as consideration for, or to finance, acquisitions;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets; and\n\u2022an increase in our costs or a decrease in our revenues associated with any potential royalty owner or landowner claims or disputes, or other litigation encountered in connection with an acquisition.\nIf the Reliance Acquisition is consummated, we may be unable to successfully integrate the Reliance Assets into our business or achieve the anticipated benefits of the Reliance Acquisition.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Reliance Acquisition will depend in part upon whether we can integrate the acquired assets into our existing business in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process successfully. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022recoverable reserves;\n\u2022future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u2022availability and cost of transportation of production to markets;\n\u2022availability and cost of drilling equipment and of skilled personnel;\n\u2022development and operating costs including access to water and potential environmental and other liabilities; and\n\u2022regulatory, permitting and similar matters.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we have performed a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. The review was based on our analysis of historical production data, assumptions regarding capital expenditures and anticipated production declines without review by an independent petroleum engineering firm. Data used in such review was furnished by the seller or obtained from publicly available sources. Our review may not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to fully assess the deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves for all of the acquired properties, and the reserves and production related to the acquired assets may differ materially after such data is further reviewed. Inspections will not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or a portion of the underlying deficiencies. We are often not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis, and, as is the case with certain liabilities associated with the assets to be acquired in the Reliance Acquisition, we are entitled to indemnification for only certain environmental liabilities. The integration process may be subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired assets will perform in accordance with our expectations or that our expectations with respect to integration as a result of the Reliance Acquisition will materialize.\nFailure to complete the Reliance Acquisition could negatively impact our future business and financial results.\nThe consummation of the pending Reliance Acquisition is subject to various customary and other closing conditions, some of which are beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that the Reliance Acquisition will be consummated. If the Reliance Acquisition is not completed or if there are significant delays in completing the Reliance Acquisition, our future business and financial results and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. In particular, there may be negative reactions from the financial markets due to the fact that current prices of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the Reliance Acquisition will be completed.\nThe loss of any member of our management team, upon whose knowledge, relationships with industry participants, leadership and technical expertise we rely could diminish our ability to conduct our operations and harm our ability to execute our business plan.\nOur success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of those members of our management team whose knowledge, relationships with industry participants, leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace. In particular, our ability to successfully acquire additional properties, to increase our reserves, to participate in drilling opportunities and to identify and enter into commercial arrangements depends on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants. In addition, our ability to select and evaluate suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment is dependent on our management team\u2019s knowledge and expertise in the industry. To continue to develop our business, we rely on our management team\u2019s knowledge and expertise in the industry and will use our management team\u2019s relationships with industry participants to enter into strategic relationships. The members of our management team may terminate their employment with our company at any time. If we were to lose members of our management team, we may not be able to replace the knowledge or relationships that they possess and our ability to execute our business plan could be materially harmed.\nDeficiencies of title to our leased interests could significantly affect our financial condition.\nWe typically do not incur the expense of a title examination prior to acquiring oil and natural gas leases or undivided interests in oil and natural gas leases or other developed rights. If an examination of the title history of a property reveals that an oil or natural gas lease or other developed rights have been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral interest desired, our interest would substantially decline in value or be eliminated. In such cases, the amount paid for such oil or natural gas lease or leases or other developed rights may be lost. It is generally our practice not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest to be acquired. Rather, we typically rely upon the judgment of oil and natural gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental or county clerk\u2019s office before attempting to acquire a lease or other developed rights in a specific mineral interest.\nPrior to drilling an oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in the oil and natural gas industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review of the spacing unit within which the proposed oil or natural gas well is to be drilled to ensure there are no obvious deficiencies in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title, such as obtaining affidavits of heirship or causing an estate to be administered. Such curative work entails expense, and the operator may elect to proceed with a well despite defects to the title identified in the preliminary title opinion. Furthermore, title issues may arise at a later date that were not initially detected in any title review or examination. Any one or more of the foregoing could require us to reverse revenues previously recognized and potentially negatively affect our cash flows and results of\noperations. Our failure to obtain perfect title to our leaseholds may adversely affect our current production and reserves and our ability in the future to increase production and reserves.\nOur lack of industry and geographical diversification may increase the risk of an investment in our company.\nWe have begun to diversify with the pending Reliance Acquisition in the Appalachian Basin and smaller acquisitions in the Permian Basin, however our operations remain heavily concentrated in primarily oil wells in the Williston Basin. While other companies may have the ability to manage their risk by diversification, the narrow focus of our business, in terms of both the industry focus and geographic scope of our business, means that we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified. As a result of the narrow focus of our business, we may be disproportionately exposed to the effects of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in our areas caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, weather events or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil or natural gas. Additionally, we may be exposed to further risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a particular area of operations.\nOur derivatives activities could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas, we enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our expected production, which may include swaps, collars, puts and other structures. In accordance with applicable accounting principles, we are required to record our derivatives at fair market value, and they are included on our balance sheet as assets or liabilities and in our statements of income as gain (loss) on derivatives, net. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair market value of our derivative instruments. In addition, while intended to mitigate the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, our derivatives transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative contracts for such period. If the actual amount of production is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount of production is lower than the notional amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which a counterparty to our derivative contracts is unable to satisfy its obligations under the contracts; our production is less than expected; or there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative arrangement.\nDecommissioning costs are unknown and may be substantial. Unplanned costs could divert resources from other projects.\nWe may become responsible for costs associated with plugging, abandoning and reclaiming wells, pipelines and other facilities that we use for production of oil and natural gas reserves. Abandonment and reclamation of these facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to as \u201cdecommissioning.\u201d We accrue a liability for decommissioning costs associated with our wells, but have not established any cash reserve account for these potential costs in respect of any of our properties. If decommissioning is required before economic depletion of our properties or if our estimates of the costs of decommissioning exceed the value of the reserves remaining at any particular time to cover such decommissioning costs, we may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could impair our ability to focus capital investment in other areas of our business.\nWe depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. In addition, we have developed or may develop proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. It is possible that we, or these third parties, could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware, or that third party service providers could cause a breach of our data. We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties for our computing and communications infrastructure or any other interruptions to, or breaches of, our\ninformation systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, loss of sensitive or confidential information or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. To our knowledge we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future either as a result of an interruption to or a breach of our systems or those of our third party vendors and service providers.\nRisks Related to Our Financing and Indebtedness\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility will negatively impact our liquidity and could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAvailability under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, with scheduled semiannual (April 1 and October 1) and other elective borrowing base redeterminations based upon, among other things, projected revenues from, and asset values of, the oil and natural gas properties securing the revolving credit facility. The lenders under the revolving credit facility can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Reductions in estimates of our producing oil, NGL and natural gas reserves could result in a reduction of our borrowing base thereunder. The same could also arise from other factors, including but not limited to lower commodity prices or production; inability to drill or unfavorable drilling results; changes in crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserve engineering; increased operating and/or capital costs; or other factors affecting our lenders\u2019 ability or willingness to lend (including factors that may be unrelated to our company). Any significant reduction in our borrowing base could result in a default under current and/or future debt instruments, negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we could be required to repay the excess. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets or take other actions to address. Any such sale or other actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur revolving credit facility and other agreements governing indebtedness contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur revolving credit facility, the indenture governing our senior indebtedness, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things: declare or pay any dividend or make any other distributions on, purchase or redeem our equity interests or purchase or redeem certain debt; make loans or certain investments; make certain acquisitions and investments; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain types of equity securities; incur liens; transfer or sell assets; create subsidiaries; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and engage in transactions with our affiliates. In addition, the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants and other covenants. As a result of these covenants, we could be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our revolving credit facility or any other indebtedness could result in an event of default under our revolving credit facility or our other indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If an event of default under our revolving credit facility occurs and remains uncured, the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us; could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable; may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; and may prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements.\nAn event of default or an acceleration under our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default and an acceleration under other existing or future indebtedness. Conversely, an event of default or an acceleration under any other existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default and an acceleration under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by perfected liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets and if we default thereunder the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations or our obligations related to our preferred stock.\nWe expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to the cyclical nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can service in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments, or to permit us to pay dividends on our preferred stock. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt or dividends on our preferred stock. Many of these factors, such as oil and natural gas prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control.\nIf we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt; selling assets; reducing or delaying capital investments; or seeking to raise additional capital. However, we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our preferred stock. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or pay dividends on our preferred stock, or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe currently owe cumulative dividends with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock, which precludes us from paying dividends with respect to our common stock and has certain other potential or actual adverse consequences.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock accrues dividends that are payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, which commenced on May 15, 2020, when, as and if declared by our Board. As of December 31, 2020, no dividends had been declared or paid, and there were approximately $16.3 million of accumulated dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our failure to pay dividends with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock precludes us from paying dividends or making other distributions on our common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for all preceding dividend periods have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid in full. Additionally, if dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears and unpaid for three or more semi-annual dividend periods (whether or not consecutive), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to serve on the Board during the term of such payment arrearage. Since dividends are currently in arrears for two semi-annual dividend periods, this would occur as a result of the next semi-annual dividend period for which dividends are not paid.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase and we are unable to effectively hedge our interest rate risk, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates under our revolving credit agreement.\nLIBOR is a basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on loans and payment rates on other financial instruments. Our revolving credit agreement uses LIBOR as the reference rate for Eurodollar denominated borrowings. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time, if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or whether different reference rates will develop. It is impossible to predict the effect these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR, other benchmark rates or floating rate debt instruments. Although our revolving credit agreement contains LIBOR alternative provisions and the ability to negotiate an alternative reference rate, new methods of calculating reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rates under our revolving credit agreement to be materially different than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to certain limitations, including under our revolving credit facility, our senior notes and under any future debt agreements. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase. Our level of indebtedness could, for instance, prevent us from\nengaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or from making desirable capital expenditures. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nOur business plan requires significant capital expenditures, which we may be unable to obtain on favorable terms or at all.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt issuances, and equity issuances. Cash reserves, cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to fund our continuing operations and business plan and goals. We may require additional capital and we may be unable to obtain such capital if and when required. If our access to capital were limited due to numerous factors, which could include a decrease in operating cash flow due to lower oil and natural gas prices or decreased production or deterioration of the credit and capital markets, we would have a reduced ability to develop our properties, replace our reserves and pursue our business plan and goals. We may not be able to incur additional debt under our revolving credit facility, issue debt or equity, engage in asset sales or access other methods of financing on acceptable terms or at all. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our cash from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may not be able to implement our business plan and may be required to scale back our operations, sell assets at unattractive prices or obtain financing on unattractive terms, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nThe current administration, acting through the executive branch and/or in coordination with Congress, could enact rules and regulations that restrict our ability to acquire federal leases in the future and/or impose more onerous permitting and other costly environmental, health and safety requirements.\nPresident Biden has stated that he intends to issue Executive Orders to permanently protect certain federal lands, establish monuments, restrict new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, and modify royalties to account for climate costs. In January 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order temporarily suspending oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters. In addition, the current administration has indicated that his administration is likely to pursue more stringent methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations. These efforts, among others, are intended to support the current administration\u2019s stated goal of addressing climate change. Potential actions of a Democratic-controlled Congress include imposing more restrictive laws and regulations pertaining to permitting, limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, increased requirements for financial assurance and bonding for decommissioning liabilities, and carbon taxes. Any of these administrative or Congressional actions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by restricting the lands available for development and/or access to permits required for such development, or by imposing additional and costly environmental, health and safety requirements.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe have net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards that we may use to offset against taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At December 31, 2020, we had an estimated NOL carryforward of approximately $474.5 million for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cIRC\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d can be subject to limitations on the use of its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We underwent an \u201cownership change\u201d during 2018 and, as a result, the use of our existing NOL carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382, which are generally determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate as defined in Section 382. See Note 10 to our financial statements. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization\nperiod for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Although these provisions were largely unchanged in the Tax Act, Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of future tax reform legislation. Moreover, other more general features of any additional tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted in future legislation and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe enactment of new or increased severance taxes and impact fees on natural gas production could negatively impact the assets we expect to acquire in the Reliance Acquisition.\nThe tax laws, rules and regulations that affect the operation of the assets that we expect to acquire in the pending Reliance Acquisition are subject to change. For example, Pennsylvania\u2019s governor has in past legislative sessions proposed legislation to impose a state severance tax on the extraction of natural resources, including natural gas produced from the Marcellus Shale formation, either in replacement of or in addition to the existing state impact fee. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislature has not thus far advanced any of the governor\u2019s severance tax proposals; however, severance tax legislation may continue to be proposed in future legislative sessions. Any such tax increase or change could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and financial position as it relates to these assets.\nOur business involves the selling and shipping by rail of crude oil, including from the Bakken shale, which involves risks of derailment, accidents and liabilities associated with cleanup and damages, as well as potential regulatory changes that may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA portion of our crude oil production is transported to market centers by rail. Derailments in North America of trains transporting crude oil have caused various regulatory agencies and industry organizations, as well as federal, state and municipal governments, to focus attention on transportation by rail of flammable materials. Any changes to existing laws and regulations, or promulgation of new laws and regulations, including any voluntary measures by the rail industry, that result in new requirements for the design, construction or operation of tank cars used to transport crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices at market centers throughout the United States, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any derailment of crude oil from the Bakken shale involving crude oil that we have sold or are shipping may result in claims being brought against us that may involve significant liabilities.\nOur derivative activities expose us to potential regulatory risks.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), Federal Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) have statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to derivative activities that we undertake with respect to oil, natural gas, NGLs, or other energy commodities, we are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislative and regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and preventing excessive speculation. In one of the rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued in January 2020 (withdrawing previous proposals from 2013 and 2016), proposed rules imposing position limits for certain futures and options contracts in various commodities (including oil and gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Under the proposed rules on position limits, certain types of derivative transactions are exempt from these limits, provided that such derivative transactions satisfy the CFTC's requirements for certain enumerated \u201cbona fide\u201d derivative transactions. The CFTC has also adopted final rules regarding aggregation of positions, under which a party that controls the trading of, or owns ten percent or more of the equity interests in, another party will have to aggregate the positions of the controlled or owned party with its own positions for purposes of determining compliance with position limits unless an exemption applies. The CFTC\u2019s aggregation rules are now in effect, although CFTC staff has granted relief until August 12, 2022 from various conditions and requirements in the final aggregation rules. These rules may affect both the size of the positions that we may hold and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade with us, potentially increasing the costs of transactions. Moreover, such changes could\nmaterially reduce our access to derivative opportunities, which could adversely affect revenues or cash flow during periods of low commodity prices.\nThe CFTC also has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although we believe we qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to mitigate its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use. If our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions. The ultimate effect of these rules and any additional regulations on our business is uncertain.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements on our business will not be known until the regulations are fully implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. In addition, it is possible that the current administration could expand regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and the entities that participate in that market through either the Dodd-Frank Act or the enactment of new legislation. Regulations issued under the Dodd-Frank Act (including any further regulations implemented thereunder) and any new legislation also may require certain counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. Such legislation and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements and through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. We maintain an active hedging program related to commodity price risks. Such legislation and regulations could reduce trading positions and the market-making activities of our counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of legislation and regulations or any resulting changes in the derivatives markets, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures or to make payments on our debt obligations. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operational interests, as operated by our third-party operating partners, are regulated extensively at the federal, state, tribal and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Under these laws and regulations, our company (either directly or indirectly through our operating partners) could also be liable for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our business and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects.\nPart of the regulatory environment in which we do business includes, in some cases, legal requirements for obtaining environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing drilling and production activities. In addition, our activities are subject to the regulations regarding conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our business and limit the quantity of natural gas we may produce and sell. A major risk inherent in the drilling plans in which we participate is the need for our operators to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on the development of our properties. Additionally, the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs of compliance with these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our profitability. At this time, we cannot predict the effect of this increase on our results of operations. Furthermore, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage to larger companies in our industry that can spread these additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating staff.\nEnvironmental risks may adversely affect our business.\nAll phases of the oil and natural gas business can present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, state and municipal laws and regulations. Environmental legislation provides for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with oil and natural gas operations. The legislation also requires that wells and facility sites be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. There is risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of the handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our business, and historical operations and waste disposal practices. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, loss of our leases, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations and the imposition of injunctive relief.\nEnvironmental legislation is evolving in a manner we expect may result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and may require us to incur costs to remedy such discharge, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and regardless of whether our operating partners met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. In addition, claims for damages to persons, property or natural resources may result from environmental and other impacts of operations on our properties. The application of environmental laws to our business may cause us to curtail production or increase the costs of our production, development or exploration activities.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is used extensively by our third-party operating partners. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. Any federal or state legislative or regulatory changes with respect to hydraulic fracturing could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs or result in operational delays, and the consequences of any failure to comply by us or our third-party operating partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in response to concerns relating to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities (so-called \u201cinduced seismicity\u201d), regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. States may, from time to time, develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our operators to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Until such pending or threatened legislation or regulations are finalized and implemented, it is not possible to estimate their impact on our business.\nAny of the above risks could impair our ability to manage our business and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \"greenhouse gases\" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the o oil and natural gas we produce.\nRestrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, climate change may be associated with increased volatility in seasonal temperatures, as well as extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\u201d and \u201c-Climate Change\u201d for a further discussion of the laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and of climate change.\nRisk Related to our Common Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware state law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the market price of our capital stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without any further vote or action by our shareholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power or economic value of our shares. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders, including, among others, limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings, limitations on the ability of our shareholders to act by written consent, and advance notice provisions for shareholders proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of shareholders. Delaware law generally prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d meaning generally that a shareholder who owns 15% or more of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date such shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless various conditions are met.\nThe availability of shares for sale or other issuance in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, or issue additional shares of preferred stock, which are convertible into shares of common stock. In the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for acquisitions, as consideration in acquisitions, to pay down debt, to fund capital expenditures or general corporate expenses, in connection with the exercise of stock options or to satisfy our obligations under our incentive plans. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash, our preferred stock and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities, including our preferred stock, that are convertible into, exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. The occurrence of any of these events or any issuance of common stock upon conversion of our currently outstanding preferred stock may dilute your ownership interest in our company, reduce our earnings per share and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nInvestors in our common stock may be required to look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nAny payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Covenants contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness and the Certificate of Designations for our preferred stock restrict the payment of dividends. Investors may be forced to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.", "PERMNO": 92601, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "NOG"}
