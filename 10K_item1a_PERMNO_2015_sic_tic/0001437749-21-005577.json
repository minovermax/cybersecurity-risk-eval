{"cik": "353020", "company": "Aegion Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Report when evaluating our business and financial condition and an investment in our common stock. Should any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, such developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE PENDING MERGER\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainty about the effect of the proposed Merger on our employees, customers, and other parties may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation regardless of whether the proposed Merger is completed. These risks to our business include but are not limited to the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the proposed Merger:\n\u2022 the impairment of our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, including key personnel;\n\u2022 the diversion of significant management time and resources towards the completion of the proposed Merger;\n\u2022 difficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners;\n\u2022 delays or deferments of certain business decisions by our customers, suppliers, and other business partners;\n\u2022 the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business because the Merger Agreement requires us to conduct our business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the completion of the proposed Merger;\n\u2022 any litigation relating to the proposed Merger, including any Merger Litigation as defined below, and the costs related thereto; and\n\u2022 the incurrence of significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger.\nFailure to consummate the proposed Merger within the expected time frame or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the proposed Merger will be consummated. The consummation of the proposed Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders convened for such purpose, no United States governmental authority having enacted any law or order enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger and any applicable waiting period or approval under the HSR Act, shall have expired, been terminated or obtained. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon the other party\u2019s representations and warranties being true and correct to the extent specified in the Merger Agreement, the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement and, in case of New Mountain's obligation to consummate the Merger, since the signing of the Merger Agreement no material adverse effect on the Company's business having occurred and be continuing. There can be no assurance that these and other conditions to closing will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all.\nThe Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provision for both the Company and Parent, subject, in certain circumstances, to the payment by the Company of a termination fee of $30,000,000. If we are required to make this payment, doing so may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that a remedy will be available to us in the event of a breach of the Merger Agreement by New Mountain or that we will wholly or partially recover for any damages incurred by us in connection with the proposed Merger. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us among our customers or in the investment community or business community generally. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, partners, suppliers and employees, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction. In addition, if the proposed Merger is not completed, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire the Company at a price of $26.00 per share or higher, on terms acceptable to us, the share price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the proposed Merger will be completed. Also, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the proposed Merger is not completed. Many of these fees and costs may be payable by us even if the proposed Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the proposed Merger.\nLitigation filed against Aegion, its board of directors or New Mountain could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger or adversely affect our business.\nIn connection with the Merger, lawsuits may be filed against Aegion, its board of directors or New Mountain in connection with the Merger (\u201cMerger Litigation\u201d). Any Merger Litigation may prevent or delay the completion of the Merger and the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and market price.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRIES\nOur businesses face significant competition in the industries in which they operate.\nMany of our products and services face direct competition from companies offering similar products or services. Competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets. If we are unable to realize our objectives, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits.\nIn the water and wastewater rehabilitation portion of our Infrastructure Solutions segment, we face competition from companies providing similar products and services as well as companies providing other methods of rehabilitation that we do not offer, including traditional dig-and-replace, which is still the preferred method in the water rehabilitation market. In the trenchless wastewater rehabilitation market, CIPP is one of the preferred methods. In this market, few significant barriers to entry exist and, as a result, any organization that has the financial resources and access to technical expertise and bonding may become a competitor. As such, we compete with many smaller firms on a local or regional level and with several larger firms on the global and national levels. In water rehabilitation, where there are more significant barriers to entry because the market is strictly regulated, we compete with a smaller number of specialty contractors around the world. Further, our Fusible PVC\u00ae pipe products compete against other more traditional products, such as HDPE and restrained joint PVC pipe products.\nIn the infrastructure rehabilitation portion of our Infrastructure Solutions segment, the Tyfo\u00ae system competes against traditional methods of structural retrofitting. There are significant barriers to entry, including testing requirements, experience, intellectual property and certifications. In manufacturing, we only compete with a handful of FRP suppliers. However, with respect to installation, we compete with a number of FRP applicators. Our ability to grow revenues in this market could be adversely impacted if any of our competitors were to become fully-integrated like us or if new entrants in the market were to develop strong installation and manufacturing expertise.\nIn our Corrosion Protection platform, we compete primarily with specialty firms in the pipeline protection industry and both a limited number of large firms globally and a large number of smaller firms regionally in the cathodic protection industry. In addition, customers can select a variety of methods to meet their pipe installation, rehabilitation, coating and cathodic protection needs, including methods that we do not offer.\nIn our Energy Services business, we compete with a limited number of local, regional and national companies in the oil and gas procurement, construction, maintenance and turnaround industries on the U.S. West Coast.\nCyclical downturns in the mining, oil and natural gas industries, including a substantial or extended decline in the price of mined minerals, oil or natural gas, or in the oil field, refinery and mining services businesses, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe mining, oil and natural gas industries are highly cyclical. Demand for the majority of the oil field, refinery and mining products and services provided by our Corrosion Protection platform and Energy Services business are substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the mining, oil and natural gas industries for the exploration, development and production of mined minerals, crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to the prices of these commodities and generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future mined mineral, oil and natural gas prices. The prices of these commodities can be volatile. There are numerous factors affecting the related industries and, thereby, the supply of, and demand for, our products and services, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 market prices of mined minerals, oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices;\n\u2022 cost of producing mined minerals, oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 the level of mining, drilling and production activity;\n\u2022 the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022 mergers, consolidations and downsizing among our clients;\n\u2022 coordination by various oil-producing countries, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);\n\u2022 the output and willingness to export of certain oil-producing countries;\n\u2022 the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our clients;\n\u2022 financial condition of our client base and their ability to fund capital and maintenance expenditures;\n\u2022 political instability in oil-producing countries;\n\u2022 price wars between oil-producing countries;\n\u2022 tax incentives, including for alternative energy sources;\n\u2022 domestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions, including those that can affect mining, oil or natural gas operations over a wide area;\n\u2022 availability of energy sources other than oil and gas;\n\u2022 level of consumption of minerals, oil, natural gas and petrochemicals by consumers, including the effects of increased regulation, conservation measures and technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022 availability of services and materials for our clients to grow their capital expenditures.\nAs seen in the historic high volatility in crude oil prices and other energy commodities, prices for mined minerals, oil and natural gas are subject to periodic downturns and large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors (including those set forth above) that are beyond our control, and we expect such prices to continue to be volatile. Demand for the products and services we provide could decrease in the event of a sustained reduction in demand for mined minerals, oil or natural gas, while perceptions of long-term decline in the prices of mined materials, oil and natural gas by mining, oil and gas companies (some of our customers) can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale projects or result in downward pressure on the prices we charge. As such, a significant downturn in the mining, oil and/or natural gas industries could result in a reduction in demand for our mining, oil field and refinery services and could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, the volatility of such prices and the resulting effects are difficult to predict, which reduces our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to changing conditions.\nOPERATIONAL RISK\nThe rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus and measures implemented to combat it are having, and are likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the eventual duration and severity of the pandemic may increase the materiality of the ultimate effect on our business. It is likely that there will be future negative effects that we cannot presently predict, including in the near-term. Similar global health concerns or pandemics in the future could also negatively impact our operations, supply chain and customer base.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, including the resulting actions taken by businesses, governments and consumers, have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity. This has resulted in current, and likely continued, adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity. Generally speaking, across all of our businesses, these effects include, without limitation, potential significant volatility or decreases in the demand for our products and services, changes in customer behavior and preferences, disruptions in or closures of our manufacturing and other facilities or those of our customers and suppliers, disruptions within our supply chain, limitations on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel, potential financial difficulties of customers and suppliers, significant changes in economic or political conditions, and related financial and commodity volatility, including volatility in raw material and other input costs.\nWith regard to our Infrastructure Solutions segment, where a significant majority of our customers are municipalities, COVID-19 has resulted in decreased municipal revenue which in turn may result in decreased municipal spending, including spending on the services that we provide. Further, although we are generally considered to be an essential business as defined by various governmental authorities and can, therefore, continue to execute projects, shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders have impacted the availability of subcontractors and other key resources, causing challenges and delays in executing work. Reduced staffing and resources within municipalities or municipal closures have resulted in a lack of resources to grant or oversee work, causing project delays and challenges collecting payment for work completed.\nWith regard to our Corrosion Protection segment, COVID-19 has significantly reduced the demand for oil. This reduced demand for oil resulting from COVID-19 has had, and is reasonably likely to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the demand for our services and products. Specifically, our customers have cancelled or deferred investments and shuttered existing facilities, which has reduced demand for our services. Additionally, actions taken by governmental authorities in the Middle East and elsewhere that limit the movement of people and equipment are adversely impacting our ability to execute work that is dependent on labor and resources from other countries. A widespread COVID-19 outbreak in the Middle East or any other important geography for our business would further challenge our ability to complete projects on budget and on schedule, potentially resulting in a material adverse impact on our business.\nLike our Corrosion Protection segment, the reduced demand for oil has reduced the demand for the services provided through our Energy Services business. Although we have significantly reduced our upstream activities in the past several years, the demand for our remaining upstream maintenance and construction services has decreased. Then, from a downstream perspective, the refineries in which we work are deferring capital spending and non-essential maintenance, which has decreased demand for our maintenance services and delayed some of our turnaround and capital construction work. Certain Energy Services customers have also put downward pressure on our pricing through requests or demands for price discounts or other accommodations.\nDespite our efforts to manage the impacts, the degree to which COVID-19 and related actions ultimately impacts our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows will depend on factors beyond our control including the eventual scope of the outbreak, the continuing actions taken to contain COVID-19 and mitigate its public health effects, the impact on the U.S. and global economies and demand for our products, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. It is further uncertain what the impact of various responses being taken in the U.S. and other countries will have on the economy, international trade, our industries, our businesses and the businesses of our customers and suppliers.\nSimilar global health concerns in the future could also negatively impact our operations, supply chain and customer base.\nCOVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate the other risk factors that we identify herein. COVID-19 may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nWe may experience cost overruns on our projects.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business under guaranteed maximum price or fixed price contracts, where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions, prices and availability of materials and other exigencies. Our profitability depends heavily on our ability to make accurate estimates. Inaccurate estimates, or changes in other circumstances, such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, cost of raw materials, trade disputes and tariffs, currency fluctuations or our suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 inability to perform could result in substantial losses, as such changes adversely affect the revenues and gross profit recognized on each project.\nWe may incur significant costs in providing services in excess of original project scope without having an approved change order.\nAfter commencement of a contract, we may perform, without the benefit of an approved change order from the customer, additional services requested by the customer that were not contemplated in our contract price for various reasons, including customer changes, incomplete or inaccurate engineering, changes in project specifications and other similar information provided to us by the customer. Our construction contracts generally require the customer to compensate us for additional work or expenses incurred under these circumstances.\nA failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record in the current period an adjustment to revenues and profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Any such adjustments, if substantial, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly for the period in which such adjustments are made. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, approved change orders in an amount adequate to compensate us for our additional work or expenses.\nAn inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and in particular, engineers, estimators, project managers, line workers, skilled craft workers and other experienced professionals, could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, which could harm our business and impair our future revenues and profitability.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified engineers, estimators, project managers, line workers, skilled craft workers and other experienced professionals in accordance with our needs is an important factor in our ability to maintain profitability and grow our business. The market for these professionals is competitive, particularly during periods of economic growth when the supply is limited. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to retain or attract qualified personnel when needed. Therefore, when we anticipate or experience growing demand for our services, we may incur additional cost to maintain a professional staff in excess of our current contract needs in an effort to have sufficient qualified personnel available to address this anticipated demand. If we do incur additional compensation and benefit costs, our customer contracts may not allow us to pass through these costs. We may recruit skilled professionals from other countries to work in the U.S., and from the U.S. and other countries to work abroad. Limitations imposed by immigration laws in the U.S. and abroad, travel bans, and difficulties obtaining visas and other restrictions on international travel could hinder our ability to attract necessary qualified personnel and harm our business and future operating results.\nCompetent and experienced engineers, project managers and craft workers are especially critical to the profitable performance of our contracts, particularly on our fixed-price contracts where superior design or execution of the project can result in profits greater than originally estimated or where inferior design or project execution can reduce or eliminate estimated profits or even result in a loss. Our project managers are involved in most aspects of contracting and contract execution including:\n\u2022 supervising the bidding process, including providing estimates of significant cost components, such as material and equipment needs, and the size, productivity and composition of the workforce;\n\u2022 negotiating contracts;\n\u2022 supervising project performance, including performance by our employees, subcontractors and other third-party suppliers and vendors;\n\u2022 estimating costs for completion of contracts that is used to estimate amounts that can be reported as revenues and earnings on the contract under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting;\n\u2022 negotiating requests for change orders and the final terms of approved change orders; and\n\u2022 determining and documenting claims by us for increased costs incurred due to the failure of customers, subcontractors and other third-party suppliers of equipment and materials to perform on a timely basis and in accordance with contract terms.\nThe implementation of California Health and Safety Code Section 25536.7 (the \u201cCalifornia Refinery Safety Law\u201d), which requires owners and operators to use only building trade union contractors for covered work at the refineries (if not self-performed), has the potential to reduce, constrict or disrupt the entire labor pool for refinery maintenance in California by: (i) eliminating the non-union workforce; and (ii) requiring the use of the same workforce that also performs public works and general construction in California. This could adversely affect staffing for large turnaround projects at California refineries. This could also adversely affect Energy Services\u2019 ability to support turnaround and project work outside California, due to its past reliance on its mobile California workforce to staff short term projects throughout the West Coast. There will be a significant wage differential between high union wages in California and wages in other states on the West Coast, creating a large disincentive for the California workforce to leave the state. The uncertainty created by this industry workforce change has the potential to negatively impact the entire West Coast refinery labor market, which in turn would negatively impact our revenues, profits and operations. The enactment of similar legislation outside California, as was the case in Washington state in 2019, may likewise have a negative impact on our revenues, profits and operations.\nIn addition, we use a multi-level sales force structured around target markets and key accounts, focusing on marketing our products and services to engineers, consultants, administrators, technical staff and elected officials. We are dependent on our personnel to continue to develop improvements to our proprietary processes, including materials used and the methods of manufacturing, installing, strengthening, coating and cathodic protection and we require quality field personnel to effectively and profitably perform our work. Our success in attracting and retaining qualified personnel is dependent on the resources available in individual geographic areas and the impact on the labor supply of general economic conditions, as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment. Our failure to attract, train, integrate, engage and retain qualified personnel could have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages, staffing shortages and other labor matters.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our Aegion Energy Services business had approximately 1,095 employees that were represented by unions, although these numbers are constantly changing as customer demands change. Infrastructure Solutions has approximately 129 employees represented by unions. Although we believe that our relations with our employees and the unions are good, no assurances can be made that we will not experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees, or our employees in general, especially in the context of any future negotiations with our labor unions. We can also make no assurance that future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in a significant increase in the cost of labor. Approximately 80% of our Energy Services union employees currently participate in multi-employer benefit plans, which is a result of the transition of many of our clients to our building trade union contracting entity. The number of multi-employer plans in which our employees participate varies depending on how many local unions we are using at any particular time, but contributions were made to 36 multi-employer plans in 2020. Participation in multi-employer benefit plans may result in liability to Aegion Energy Services in excess of that directly attributable to employees of Aegion Energy Services.\nAdditionally, the employees of some of our customers are unionized, especially the customers of our Aegion Energy Services business. Any strikes, work stoppages or other labor matters experienced by our customers may impact our ability to work on projects and, as a result, have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, in certain areas of our business, most notably in our Corrosion Protection platform, our employees are not represented by unions. As a result, we may not be eligible to bid or perform certain work that requires union labor, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe revenues from the water and wastewater portion of our Infrastructure Solutions platform are substantially dependent on municipal government spending and continuous, uninterrupted governmental operations.\nMany of our customers are municipal governmental agencies and, as such, we are dependent on municipal spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local political circumstances, budgetary constraints, downturns in the municipal bond market and other factors. Consequently, future municipal spending may not be allocated to projects that would benefit our business or may not be allocated in the amounts or for the size of the projects that we anticipated. A decrease in municipal spending on such projects would adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, government disruptions, such as government shutdowns, may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business.\nA substantial portion of our raw materials is from a limited number of vendors, and we are subject to market fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities.\nThe primary products and raw materials used by our Corrpro operations include zinc, aluminum, magnesium and other metallic anodes, as well as wire and cable. We believe that Corrpro has multiple sources available for these raw materials and is not dependent on any single vendor to meet its supply needs. However, the prices of these raw materials have historically been affected by the prices of energy, petroleum, steel and other commodities, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency and exchange rates. A significant increase in the prices of these raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe purchase the majority of our fiber requirements for Insituform\u00ae tube manufacturing from four sources. We believe, however, that alternate sources are readily available, and we continue to negotiate with other supply sources. The manufacture of the Insituform\u00ae tubes used in our water and wastewater pipeline rehabilitation business is dependent upon the availability of resin, a petroleum-based product. We currently have qualified multiple resin suppliers, however, at the current time we purchase the majority of our resin for our North American operations from one supplier. For our European operations, we currently have qualified six resin suppliers. We believe that these and other sources of resin supply are readily available. Historically, resin prices have fluctuated on the basis of the prevailing prices of its inputs, including styrene and oil. We anticipate that prices will continue to be heavily influenced by the events affecting these inputs, including the oil market. If there is a shortage or contraction of fiber or resin suppliers or if the price of fiber or resin increase, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe primary products and raw materials used in the manufacture of our FRP composite systems are carbon, glass, resins, fabric and epoxy raw materials. Carbon and epoxies are the largest materials purchased, which are currently purchased through a select group of suppliers, although we believe these and the other materials are available from a number of vendors. The price of epoxy historically is affected by the price of oil. In addition, a number of factors such as worldwide demand, labor costs, energy costs, import duties and other trade restrictions may influence the price of these raw materials. An increase in the price of these raw materials may have an adverse effect on our operations. Further, because we utilize a limited number of extruders to manufacture our Fusible PVC\u00ae pipe products, we could be adversely affected if one or more of these extruders is unable to continue to manufacture our Fusible PVC\u00ae pipe products.\nWe also purchase a significant volume of fuel to operate our trucks and equipment. At present, we do not engage in any type of hedging activities to mitigate the risks of fluctuating market prices for oil or fuel. A significant increase in the price of oil could cause an adverse effect on our cost structure that we may not be able to recover from our customers.\nCertain of our facilities are located in regions that may be affected by natural disasters.\nWe have multiple facilities in and around the U.S. Gulf Coast, including facilities near Houston, Texas, and in Florida. These regions are subject to increased hurricane activity that can result in substantial flooding. Our Aegion Energy Services business serves large oil and gas customers in California and is headquartered in Southern California. Furthermore, our Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection segments have substantial operations in California. Historically, California has been susceptible to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, drought, floods and wildfires. Although we maintain loss insurance where necessary, a hurricane, earthquake, wildfire or other natural disaster could result in significant damage to our facilities, destruction or disruption of our critical business or information technology systems, recovery costs and interruption to certain of our operations. In addition, a catastrophic event could interrupt operations of our customers and suppliers, which could result in delays or cancellation of customer orders, the loss of customers, and impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products or execution of projects, which could result in loss of business or an increase in expense, both of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In the specific case of wildfires, an accusation or ultimate determination that our operations were the cause of a wildfire may also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur profitability could be negatively impacted if we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization of our crews.\nThe extent to which we utilize our crews affects our profitability. If we under-utilize our crews, our project gross margins and overall profitability suffer in the short term. If we over-utilize our crews, we may also negatively impact margins and overall profitability, as well as safety, employee satisfaction and project execution, which could result in an increase in injuries to our employees and a decline of future project awards. The utilization of our crews is impacted by numerous factors including:\n\u2022 our estimate of the headcount requirements for various units based on our forecast of the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain our talent base and manage attrition;\n\u2022 our ability to schedule our portfolio of projects to efficiently utilize our employees and minimize downtime between project assignments; and\n\u2022 our need to invest time and resources into functions such as training, business development, employee recruiting, and sales that are not chargeable to customer projects.\nExtreme weather conditions may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are likely to be impacted by weather extremes, such as excessive rain or hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, snow and ice or frigid temperatures, which may cause temporary, short-term anomalies in our operational performance in certain localized geographic regions. Our Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection segments are particularly sensitive to weather extremes. Delays and other weather impacts could adversely affect our ability to meet project deadlines and may increase a project\u2019s cost and decrease its profitability.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings, which will increase our costs and, if adversely determined, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAs a result of the type of work we do, namely construction, we may become engaged in legal proceedings arising from the operation of our business, including being named as a defendant in future actions. Such actions against us may arise out of the normal course of performing services on project sites, and include workers\u2019 compensation claims, personal injury claims, property damage claims, environmental claims and contract disputes with our customers. From time to time, we may also be named as a defendant for actions involving the violation of federal and state labor laws related to employment practices, wages and benefits. We may also be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers seeking to recover wages and benefits or seeking to recover payment of contractual amounts due to us. Further, we may make claims against customers for increased costs incurred by us resulting from, among other things, services performed by us at the request of a customer that are in excess of original project scope that are later disputed by the customer and customer-caused delays in our contract performance.\nWe maintain insurance against operating hazards in amounts that we believe are customary in our industry. However, in some instances we are self-insured and in other instances our insurance policies include deductibles and certain coverage exclusions, so we cannot provide assurance that we are adequately insured against all of the risks associated with the conduct of our business. A successful claim brought against us in excess of, or outside of, our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nLitigation, regardless of its outcome, is expensive, typically diverts the efforts of our management away from operations for varying periods of time, and can disrupt or otherwise adversely impact our relationships with current or potential customers, subcontractors and suppliers. Payment and claim disputes with customers may also cause us to incur increased interest costs resulting from incurring indebtedness under our revolving line of credit or receiving less interest income resulting from fewer funds invested due to the failure to receive payment for disputed claims and accounts.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nWe conduct manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to a variety of risks associated with doing business outside the United States.\nWe maintain significant international operations, including operations in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and South America. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 28.7%, 33.8% and 36.8%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from international operations. We expect a significant portion of our revenues and profits to come from international operations and joint ventures for the foreseeable future.\nAs a result, we are subject to a number of risks and complications associated with international manufacturing, sales, services and other operations. These include:\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and resolving disputes through some foreign legal systems;\n\u2022 foreign customers with longer payment cycles than customers in the United States;\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights or weaker intellectual property right protections in some countries;\n\u2022 tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the United States and foreign earnings subject to withholding requirements;\n\u2022 tax laws that restrict our ability to use tax credits, offset gains or repatriate funds;\n\u2022 tax laws that impose additional taxes on our operations, including the implementation of value added tax in certain countries in the Middle East;\n\u2022 sanctions, tariffs, exchange controls, trade disputes (including so-called \u201ctrade wars\u201d) or other trade restrictions, including transfer pricing restrictions, when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country;\n\u2022 difficulties with regard to, or taxes imposed on, the movement of cash between countries, including the repatriation of cash back to the United States;\n\u2022 abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations;\n\u2022 unstable political and social conditions;\n\u2022 conflicts or wars;\n\u2022 acts of terrorism or criminality;\n\u2022 kidnapping of employees;\n\u2022 nationalization or privatization of companies with which we do business;\n\u2022 protectionist policies in certain foreign countries, including those in the Middle East, that disfavor foreign companies operating in such countries;\n\u2022 forced negotiation or modification of contracts;\n\u2022 increased governmental ownership and regulation of markets in which we operate;\n\u2022 the financial instability of, and the related inability or unwillingness to timely pay for our services by, national oil companies and other foreign customers resulting from, and/or exacerbated by, depressed oil prices;\n\u2022 hostility from local populations, particularly in the Middle East;\n\u2022 tenuous, unstable or hostile relationships between countries that are interconnected in our operations; and\n\u2022 difficulties associated with compliance with a variety of laws and regulations governing international trade, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nTo the extent that our international operations are affected by these unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions, we may experience project disruptions and losses that could significantly reduce our revenues and profits.\nImplementation and achievement of international growth objectives also may be impeded by political, social and economic uncertainties or unrest in countries in which we conduct operations or market or distribute our products. In addition, compliance with multiple, and potentially conflicting, international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome or expensive.\nFor example, we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal policies, procedures and controls will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations are subject to foreign economic uncertainties and foreign currency fluctuation.\nGlobal financial and credit markets have been, and continue to be, unstable and unpredictable. For example, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom exited the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and just recently came to terms with the European Union on a trade deal. This has created significant uncertainties affecting the economy and business operations, including our operations, in the United Kingdom and the European Union. The terms of Brexit are new and untested at the current time and, as such, it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on our Company and our operations in the United Kingdom and the European Union, including our CIPP operations in Northern Ireland which service both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, our manufacturing facility in Wellingborough, United Kingdom, which distributes liners to the European Union and elsewhere, and our manufacturing facility in Stockton-on-Tees, United Kingdom, which manufactures and distributes cathodic protection equipment worldwide. As the terms of Brexit, including the new trade deal with the European Union, become more settled, our operations in the United Kingdom may be adversely impacted. The instability of the markets and weakness of the economy could affect the demand for our services, the financial strength of our customers and suppliers, their ability or willingness to do business with us, our willingness to do business with them, and/or our suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 ability to fulfill their obligations to us and/or the ability of us, our customers or our suppliers to obtain credit. These factors could adversely affect our operations, earnings and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our contracts and revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, which may result in additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits. For example, Brexit to date has resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound as compared to the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. If there is a significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the British pound, Euro, or the Canadian dollar, it may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO CORPORATE ACTIVITIES AND STRATEGY\nWe may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic investments and initiatives.\nOur strategy includes selective acquisitions, other strategic investments and initiatives that allow us to expand our business. The success of any acquisition depends upon effective integration, cultural assimilation and management of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realizing the growth potential, the anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention for other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities or contractual obligations of the acquired business or assets. We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be liable to complete the work of our joint venture partners under our joint venture arrangements.\nWe enter into contractual joint ventures in order to develop joint bids on certain contracts. The success of these joint ventures depends largely on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their obligations with respect to the joint venture. Under these joint venture arrangements, we may be required to complete our joint venture partner\u2019s portion of the contract if the joint venture partner is unable to complete its portion and a bond is not available. In such case, the additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us.\nThe actual benefits of the Restructuring may differ from those currently expected, which may reduce our operating results.\nIn 2017, we introduced the Restructuring and, through several additional actions during 2018, 2019 and 2020, expanded the scope of the restructuring to include many of our operations around the world. The Restructuring is intended to reduce complexity and risk in our business operations, eliminate losses from underperforming businesses and also significantly reduce our consolidated annual operating expenses. We substantially completed the Restructuring by the end of 2020. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for additional information and disclosures regarding our restructuring activities. We cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of the Restructuring, and if we do not, our business and results of operations may be adversely impacted. We also cannot provide assurance that we will not undertake additional restructuring activities in the future.\nDivestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, and retained liabilities from businesses that we sell could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs part of our portfolio management process, we review our operations for businesses, which may no longer be aligned with our strategic initiatives and long-term objectives. For example, as part of our Restructuring discussed above, we have recently or are in the process of divesting or otherwise exiting multiple businesses. We also continue to review our portfolio and may pursue additional divestitures. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including required separation or carve-out activities and costs, disputes with buyers or potential impairment charges. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had previously anticipated. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, we are also subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, as well as necessary contractual counter-party, regulatory and governmental approvals or consents on acceptable terms, which may prevent us from completing a transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement, as we may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against contingent liabilities related to a business sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, lease payments, product liability claims or environmental matters. Under these types of arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect future financial results.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may from time to time undertake internal reorganizations that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, including in 2020, in an effort to simplify our organizational structure and streamline our operations or for other operational reasons, we may undertake certain internal reorganizations that may involve, among other things, the combination or dissolution of certain of our existing subsidiaries, the creation of new subsidiaries and business divisions and the settlement of historical inter-company transactions. Additionally, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and its effect on the taxation of offshore earnings, in connection with these actions or our operations generally, we may determine to repatriate certain earnings from our international subsidiaries, which earnings were previously permanently reinvested in such subsidiaries\u2019 operations. In undertaking such actions, we consider, among other things, the alignment of our corporate structure with our organizational objectives, the operational and tax efficiency of our corporate structure and the long-term cash flow needs of our business. These efforts may not result in the intended or expected benefits, may result in disruptions to our business, may cause the Company to incur additional expenses or tax liabilities and may result in special charges, such as asset write-offs, workforce reductions, restructuring costs or charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or businesses. Accordingly, such actions may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAs a holding company, Aegion depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nAegion Corporation is a holding company with no significant operating assets. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depends on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payments of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and other forms may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the states and countries in which we operate.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nOur backlog is an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.\nOur backlog, which at December 31, 2020 was $662.6 million, is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellation. The revenues projected in this backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. We may be unable to complete some projects included in our backlog in the estimated time and, as a result, such projects could remain in backlog for extended periods of time. Further, our customers often have the contractual right to terminate our contract or reduce our scope of our work at the convenience of the customer. To the extent that we experience project or contract cancellation or scope adjustments, we could face a reduction in the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues that we actually receive from such backlog. In addition, one or more of our large or multi-year contracts have in the past and may in the future contribute a material portion of our backlog in any one year. The loss of business from any one of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. See the section above captioned \u201cContract Backlog\u201d for additional information on our backlog.\nOur use of input measures to recognize revenue on construction, engineering and installation services could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded results.\nRevenues from construction, engineering and installation services are recognized over time using an input measure to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. This methodology recognizes revenues and profits over the life of a project based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated project costs. Revisions to revenues and profits are made once amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. Given the uncertainties associated with some of our contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made. Revisions to estimates could result in the reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 84% of our revenues were derived from accounting utilizing estimated input measures.\nOur recognition of revenues from change orders, extra work or variations in the scope of work could be subject to reversal in future periods.\nWe recognize revenues from change orders, extra work or variations in the scope of work as set forth in our written contracts with our clients when management believes that realization of these revenues is probable and the recoverable amounts can be reasonably estimated. We also factor in all other information that we possess with respect to the change order to determine whether the change order should be recognized at all and, if recognition is appropriate, what dollar amount of the change order should be recognized. Due to factors that we may not anticipate at the time of recognition, however, revenues ultimately received on these change orders could be less than revenues that we recognized in a prior reporting period or periods, which could require us in subsequent reporting periods to reduce or reverse revenues and gross profit previously recognized.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows, market multiples and discount rates. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant businesses, could lead to further impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets for an extended period of time, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants under our credit facility.\nIn October 2015, the Company amended and restated its $650.0 million senior secured credit facility, followed by subsequent amendments in February 2018, December 2018, April 2020 and November 2020 (the \u201camended Credit Facility\u201d) with a syndicate of banks. Our amended Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets or sell assets, make investments and make other restricted payments. Our amended Credit Facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions and satisfy financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests and otherwise comply with our financial covenants may be affected by the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Report and other factors outside our control, and we may not be able to continue to meet those ratios, tests and covenants. Our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions, as applicable, or any inability to pay interest on, or principal of, our outstanding debt as it becomes due could result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable.\nAt December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as required under the amended Credit Facility. If we are unable to comply with the restrictive covenants in the future, we would be required to obtain amendments or waivers from our lenders or secure another source of financing. If our current lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely basis.\nIn addition, these restrictive covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities.\nWe occasionally access the financial markets to finance a portion of our working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs. Our ability to access these markets may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control and could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations or implement our operating strategy.\nWe occasionally borrow under our existing credit facility to fund operations, including working capital investments. Market disruptions such as those experienced in the United States and abroad in the past few years have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, resulting in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facility or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade and general economic downturns in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement our operating strategy could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may result in investors selling shares of our common stock at a loss.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 whether the Merger is consummated;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts that cover our stock or our failure to meet these estimates;\n\u2022 conditions or trends in the U.S. wastewater rehabilitation market;\n\u2022 conditions or trends in mined materials, oil and natural gas markets;\n\u2022 changes in municipal and corporate spending practices;\n\u2022 a downturn of the municipal bond market or lending markets generally;\n\u2022 changes in the federal or state governments that impact regulation and spending regarding energy and infrastructure;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of other companies operating in our industries;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of a significant acquisition or divestiture; and\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and The Nasdaq Global Select Market in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Such stock price volatility could result in investors selling shares of our common stock at a loss.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our present policy is to retain earnings to provide for the operation and expansion of our business or for the repurchase of shares of our common stock. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, cash flows, financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Furthermore, under the terms of certain debt arrangements to which we are a party, we are subject to certain limitations on paying dividends. However, we carefully review this policy regularly and could initiate dividends in the future depending on appropriate circumstances.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation or by-laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors has the authority, without any action of our stockholders, to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued upon such terms and with such designations as our board of directors may fix in its discretion, including with respect to: (i) the payment of dividends upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up; (ii) voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock; (iii) dividend rates; (iv) redemption or conversion rights; (v) liquidation preferences; or (vi) voting rights.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock set forth in our certificate of incorporation, the certificate of designation relating to such class or series of preferred stock, or as otherwise required by law, any stockholder action may be taken only at a meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any written consent by such stockholders. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors is required to amend, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with such arrangement.\nThese provisions could potentially be used to discourage attempts by others to obtain control of our company through merger, tender offer, proxy, consent or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult or more costly, even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our stockholders. These provisions also may make it more difficult for stockholders to take action opposed by our board of directors or otherwise adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provide that, unless waived by Aegion, the state courts of the State of Delaware or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any claims brought by a stockholder (including a beneficial owner) (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer or stockholder in such capacity or (ii) as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Delaware Court of Chancery. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with Aegion or Aegion\u2019s directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against Aegion and Aegion\u2019s directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CYBERSECURITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nOur business depends upon the maintenance of our proprietary technologies and information.\nWe depend on our proprietary technologies and information, many of which are no longer subject to patent protection. In addition to patent protection, we rely significantly upon trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies. We regularly enter into confidentiality agreements with our key employees, customers, potential customers and other third parties and limit access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, these measures may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to assure that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, the laws of other countries in which we operate may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We are also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights.\nOur efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify such expenses.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing technologies and customer requirements by enhancing our existing products and services. We will need to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products, features and services that address the needs of our customer base. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We cannot assure that we will succeed in developing, introducing and marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenues to justify the expenses and resources devoted to this product development and enhancement effort.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security, which could disrupt our operations and could result in a loss of assets.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personally identifiable information of our customers, suppliers, employees and other individuals. In storing and managing this information, we rely upon multiple information technology systems and networks, some of which are web-based or managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. The secure and consistent operation of these systems, networks and processes is critical to our business operations. Our systems and networks have been, and will continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats, such as botnets, distributed denial-of-service attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing, viruses, spoofing and other cyber-security incidents that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss or destruction of our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 or employees\u2019 sensitive and personal data. Successful cyber-attacks or other data breaches, as well as risks associated with compliance with applicable data privacy laws, could harm our reputation, divert management attention and resources, increase our operating expenses due to the employment of consultants and third party experts and the purchase of additional infrastructure, and/or subject us to legal or regulatory liability, resulting in increased costs and loss of revenue.\nWhile we proactively safeguard our data and are continuously enhancing our security software and controls, the increase in frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks may result in our security controls and practices and business continuity plans being ineffective in anticipating, preventing and effectively responding to all potential cyber-risk exposures. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which are not uniform and may possibly conflict in jurisdictions and countries where we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nAdditionally, our employees and certain of our third-party service providers may have access or exposure to sensitive customer data and systems. The misuse or unauthorized disclosure of information could result in contractual and legal liability for us due to the actions or inactions of our employees or vendors.\nTo improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers and suppliers, we use our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 information technology systems to submit and process invoices and payments. The failures of these systems could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, delays or cancellation of customer orders, impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products and other business disruptions. These events could lead to financial losses from loss of business or an increase in expense, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLEGAL, TAX, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by the California Refinery Safety Law related to downstream work performed in California refineries.\nAegion Energy Services continues to face challenges from the impact of the California Refinery Safety Law, which went into effect on January 1, 2014 and imposed requirements regarding the wages paid to, and qualifications held by, our employees that work in California refineries. Specifically, the law introduced new requirements for refineries and outside contractors at covered facilities when construction, alteration, demolition, installation, repair or maintenance work is performed at the covered facility and, in effect, requires the use of building trade union contractors or refinery owners or operators to perform the covered work. As a result, the California Refinery Safety Law may materially and adversely impact the costs incurred by Aegion Energy Services.\nThese requirements only pertain to contracts entered into, extended or renewed after January 1, 2014. Contracts entered into, extended or renewed prior to that date generally expired in 2018 across the industry. Aegion Energy Services has historically had long-term contracts in place with many of its major downstream clients, which it intends to maintain through its building trade union entity. Throughout 2018, Aegion Energy Services was able to transition its contracts with all of its California refinery clients to its building trade union entity in order to satisfy the conditions of the California Refinery Safety Law. However, as a result of this drastic change in the market in California, customers are looking at ways to reduce costs. For example, many clients are reevaluating their contracting strategies and have reduced, or may in the future reduce, the size of their contractor maintenance crews by increasing their own in-house maintenance capabilities. There are no assurances that clients will maintain their contracts, or the historical annual volume of work, with Aegion Energy Services as the industry adapts to operating under the California Refinery Safety Law, which could materially and adversely impact its revenues.\nThe enactment of legislation similar to the California Refinery Safety Law by states other than California in which we operate, as was the case in Washington state in 2019, could have an adverse impact on our business.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as governmental reviews relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays that could adversely affect our Corrosion Protection customers.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays. Our Corrosion Protection segment services oil and gas companies in the shale plays and we foresee strong market opportunities here. A decline in drilling of new wells and related servicing activities caused by these initiatives could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.\nOur services are subject to numerous U.S. and international environmental protection laws and regulations that are complex and stringent. For example, we must comply with a number of U.S. federal government laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation, and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials. CERCLA and comparable state laws typically impose strict, joint and several liabilities without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. The liability for the entire cost of clean-up could be imposed upon any responsible party. Other principal U.S. federal environmental, health, and safety laws affecting us include, but are not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. Our business operations may also be subject to similar state and international laws relating to environmental protection. Further, past business practices at companies that we have acquired may also expose us to future unknown environmental liabilities. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, or a failure to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial costs to us, including clean-up costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury or cessation of remediation activities. Our continuing work in the areas governed by these laws and regulations exposes us to the risk of substantial liability.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability as it relates to our necessary collection of employee and independent contractor personal data to effectively execute operations and comply with various regulatory requirements.\nIn January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act took effect, which establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for California residents. Approximately 37% of our workforce are California residents as of December 31, 2020. In addition, numerous proposals regarding privacy and data protection are pending before, or have been enacted by, U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies. Despite our commitment to complying with applicable laws, actual or alleged violations of these laws could result in legal claims or proceedings and regulatory penalties, which could disrupt our business, distract our employees and negatively impact our reputation as well as our results of operations. These rules and regulations may not be uniform and may possibly conflict in jurisdictions and countries where we conduct business. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.", "PERMNO": 44274, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "AEGN"}
