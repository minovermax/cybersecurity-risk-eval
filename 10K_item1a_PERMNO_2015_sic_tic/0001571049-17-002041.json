In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the following important factors that could affect our actual future results, including, but not limited to, our product development programs, contract revenues, expenses, net losses, and earnings per share.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and anticipate future losses.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in December 1992, including a net loss of\u2009$5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $290.6 million. We are unsure if or when we will become profitable. The size of our net losses will depend on our revenues and our expenses.\nWe have derived our revenues primarily from payments from collaborations with corporations and government entities and expect to do so for the foreseeable future. It may be years, if ever, before we will recognize revenue from product candidate sales or royalties. While we have taken efforts to control costs throughout 2016, a large portion of our expenses are fixed, including expenses related to facilities, equipment and personnel, and our ability to continue to meaningfully reduce costs is limited. In addition, we expect to continue to spend significant amounts to fund research and development to advance our programs and to enhance our core technologies. As a result of our operating expenses, we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, it may not be sustainable.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company deploying unproven technologies, and we may never be able to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, or market any of our product candidates.\nGene-based products are new and rapidly evolving medical approaches, which have not been shown to be effective on a widespread basis. Only a limited number of gene-based products have been successfully developed and commercialized to date. In addition, no gene therapy product has received regulatory\napproval in the U.S. None of our product candidates has been approved for sale in the U.S. or elsewhere. Gene-based products may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects from genes or the delivery systems, unintended immune responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy, or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval or commercial use. Successful products require significant development and investment, including a lengthy and uncertain period of testing to show their safety and effectiveness before their regulatory approval or commercialization. Other than our limited conditional approval with respect to our FMD vaccine, we have not proven our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, or commercialize gene-based medicines or vaccines.\nIf we or our collaborators fail to adequately show the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, we will not be able to obtain FDA approval of our product candidates.\nWe face the risk of failure involved in developing therapies based on new technologies and the difficulties generally associated with drug development. CGF166 is the only product candidate that we and our collaborators currently have in clinical trials. Novartis initiated dosing in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CGF166 in October 2014. On January 8, 2016, we were notified by Novartis that enrollment in the clinical trial had been paused, based on a review of data by the trial\u2019s Data Safety Monitoring Board (\u201cDSMB\u201d) in accordance with criteria in the trial protocol and the FDA placed the clinical trial on hold. The FDA lifted the clinical hold on July 25, 2016 and the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CGF166 is currently ongoing. In February 2017, we were notified that the first patient in the fourth cohort of the trial had been dosed.\nSignificant additional research and animal testing, referred to as preclinical testing, will need to be conducted before any of our other product candidates currently under active development can advance to clinical trials. It may take us many years to complete preclinical testing or trials, and we expect that doing so will be dependent on our ability to enter into collaborations. Drug development is an uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure could occur at any stage of development. Acceptable results in early testing or trials might not be repeated later. Not all products in preclinical testing or early stage clinical trials will become approved products, and historically there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables. Before an application can be filed with the FDA for product approval, we or our collaborators must show that a particular product candidate is safe and effective. Even with respect to product candidates that advance to clinical trials, we or our collaborators must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of those product candidates before FDA approval can be secured. The failure to adequately show the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates would prevent FDA approval of our products. Any one of our product candidates could fail at any time, as clinical development of drug candidates presents numerous unpredictable and significant risks and is very uncertain at all times prior to regulatory approval by the FDA or health authorities in other major markets.\nBecause regulatory approval must be obtained to market our products, we cannot predict whether or when our products will be commercialized; failure to comply with applicable regulations can also harm our business and operations.\nBiologic products are subject to stringent regulation by a wide range of governmental authorities. We cannot predict whether we or our collaborators will obtain regulatory approval for any of our products. No one can market a biologic product in the U.S. until it has completed rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials, and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA. To date, the FDA has not approved a gene therapy product for sale in the U.S. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product, and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Of particular significance are the requirements covering research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, and promotion of drugs for human use.\nBefore commencing clinical trials, we or our collaborators must submit an IND application to the FDA and wait for the IND to become effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. Even after an IND becomes effective, however, a clinical trial is subject to continuing oversight by an Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) and the FDA, and in some cases by a DSMB or Data Monitoring Committee (\u201cDMC\u201d).\nClinical trials are also subject to:\n\u2022\ngood clinical practices (\u201cGCP\u201d) regulations, which include a requirement for each subject\u2019s informed consent; and\n\u2022\npotential suspension or termination by the company conducting the clinical trial, the IRB, or the FDA at any time if, among other reasons, it is believed that the subjects participating in these trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in the IND or the conduct of the trials.\nDelays or rejections in the regulatory approval process may be encountered because of additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials, or FDA regulatory review.\nFailure to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or injunction, as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease indications for which the product has been shown through clinical trials to be safe and effective. Even if approved, a product may not be approved for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization, or the FDA may impose restrictions on distribution of the product that may materially impact our operations. The FDA also strictly regulates promotion and labeling after approval. Outside the U.S., the ability to market a product is also contingent upon receiving clearances from the appropriate regulatory authorities. This non-U.S. regulatory approval process includes risks similar to those associated with FDA clearance described above and is subject to the independent judgments, policies, priorities and decisions of the applicable regulatory authorities, which may differ from those of the FDA.\nWe or our collaborators may experience delays in conducting our clinical trials.\nClinical trials may be delayed or prematurely terminated by many factors, including: (i) limited number of, and competition for, suitable patients for the particular clinical trial; (ii) slower than expected rate of patient recruitment and enrollment; (iii) failure of patients to complete the trial; (iv) inability to obtain sufficient quantities of acceptable materials for use in clinical trials; (v) delay or failure in reaching agreement on contract terms with prospective study sites or other third-party vendors who are supporting our clinical trials; (vi) inability to reach agreement with the FDA on a trial design that we are able to execute; (vii) difficulty in adequately following up with patients after treatment; and (viii) changes in laws, regulations, regulatory policy or clinical practices. Our ability or the ability of our collaborators to enroll appropriate patients for any clinical trials for our product candidates also may be adversely affected by trials being conducted by our competitors for similar disease indications. The failure of any clinical trials to meet applicable regulatory standards, or the standards of the relevant reviewing bodies could cause such trials to be delayed, suspended or terminated, which could further delay the development of any of our product candidates. Any such delays increase our product development costs, with the possibility that we could be required to raise additional funds. Delays in one clinical trial also can adversely affect our ability and the ability of our collaborators to launch clinical trials for similar or different indications. Consequently, if such delays are significant they could negatively affect our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products.\nAdditionally, clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time by the FDA, an IRB, a DSMB or DMC, other regulatory authorities, or by us for a variety of reasons, including safety. In January 2016, Novartis paused enrollment in the clinical trial of CGF166, based on a review of data by the trial\u2019s DSMB in accordance with criteria in the trial protocol and the FDA placed the clinical trial on hold. The FDA lifted the clinical hold on July 25, 2016, and the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CGF166 is currently ongoing. Any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates could harm our financial results and commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nAny clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, and the FDA may not agree with our interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a trial to be delayed or repeated or a program to be terminated.\nWe do not currently have any late stage clinical trials in our therapeutic product or vaccine development programs and, therefore, we do not have any near-term prospects of generating revenues from the commercial sale of our therapeutic or vaccine products.\nWe do not currently have any therapeutic products or vaccines in late stage clinical programs, and the one product of ours that has received some approval is our FMD vaccine, for which a conditional license was issued that is applicable in certain emergency or similar situations. Accordingly, we do not have any near-term prospects of generating revenues from the commercial sale of our product candidates in our therapeutic product or vaccine programs. In October 2014, Novartis initiated dosing in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CGF166. In January 2016, Novartis paused enrollment in the clinical trial, and the FDA placed the clinical trial on hold. The FDA lifted the clinical hold on July 25, 2016, and the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CGF166 is currently ongoing. In February 2017, we were notified that the first patient in the fourth cohort of the trial had been dosed. However, there can be no assurance that CGF166 will successfully complete that trial, much less enter or successfully complete any other clinical trial. There also can be no assurance that any of our other therapeutic products or our vaccines will enter or successfully complete the clinical trials required for commercialization.\nWe do not know if our strategy will be successful.\nOur operating strategy focuses on working with leading companies and organizations such as Novartis and the U.S. government to leverage our proprietary gene-delivery technologies to address the prevention and treatment of significant health concerns. This strategy includes working with Novartis to facilitate the development of first-in-class products for the treatment of hearing and balance disorders, developing a sustainable revenue base by licensing rights to our proprietary vector and cell line technologies to additional companies and organizations, licensing our preclinical vaccine candidates for the prevention of RSV and the treatment of HSV-2 infection, and minimizing our cash burn by operating our business in a cost-efficient manner. This operating strategy may not be successful, and is largely dependent on the success of our collaboration agreement with Novartis, of which there can be no assurance, and our ability to enter into additional collaborations, which we have only been able to do to a limited extent.\nA central aspect of our business strategy is to enter into collaborations with other companies to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize our potential products, and if we are unable to find collaborators or sustain existing relationships, we may not be able to generate revenue and advance our products.\nA central aspect of our business strategy is to enter into collaborations to support the development of our products. Our lead program, in the field of regenerative medicine and licensed to Novartis, is for the development of novel treatments for hearing loss and balance disorders. In addition to this program, we intend to license rights to our proprietary vector and cell line technologies to additional companies and organizations and license our preclinical vaccine candidates for the prevention of RSV and the treatment of HSV-2 infection. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into licensing and other collaboration agreements on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we are not able to enter into and sustain license or other collaboration agreements, we would not be able to develop a sustainable revenue base, and we would need to raise additional funds for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and technologies and develop additional capabilities in testing, manufacturing, marketing and sales, among other areas. If we are not able to enter into successful collaborations or obtain additional funds through other means, we would have to delay, curtail or abandon the development and commercialization of certain product candidates and technologies.\nWe intend to continue to seek support for our government funded contracts and collaborations for the development of new vaccines, but our existing agreements are subject to termination and uncertain future funding and there is no certainty that we will be able to enter into new agreements.\nIn addition to corporate collaborations, we have historically entered into agreements with U.S. government agencies, such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) and the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center (\u201cNMRC\u201d) to support our vaccine research. These and similar agreements have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend\nto continue entering into these agreements in the future. Our business strategy is partially dependent on collaboration agreements with U.S. government agencies and on the ability of these government agencies to perform under these agreements, which performance depends on adequate continued funding of the agencies and their programs.\nWe have no control over the resources and funding government agencies may devote to any collaboration agreements with us, which may be subject to annual renewal and which generally may be terminated by the government agencies at any time. Any significant reductions in the funding of U.S. government agencies or in the funding areas targeted by our business could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we were to fail to satisfy our contractual obligations to deliver in the manner required by a collaboration agreement with a U.S. government agency, the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations allow the agency to cancel the agreement in whole or in part, and we may be required to perform corrective actions, including but not limited to delivering to the government any uncompleted or partially completed work. The performance of these corrective actions could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the period or periods affected. Government agencies may fail to perform their responsibilities under these agreements, which could materially impact our financial results.\nIn addition, our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs, are subject to audits and adjustments by negotiation between us and the U.S. government. As part of the audit process, the government audit agency verifies that all charges made by a contractor against a contract are legitimate and appropriate. Audits may result in recalculation of contract revenues and non-reimbursement of some contract costs and fees. Any audits of our contract related costs and fees could result in material adjustments to our revenues. In addition, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take several years. Consequently, at the outset of a major program, the contract is usually incrementally funded and additional funds are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency as appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Any failure of such agencies to continue to fund such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe apply for and have received funding from government agencies under Small Business Technology Transfer and Small Business Innovation Research grants. Eligibility of public companies to receive such grants is based on size and ownership criteria that are under review by the Small Business Administration. As a result, our eligibility may change in the future and additional funding from this source may not be available.\nWe depend, and anticipate depending further, on corporate collaborators for the development of our product candidates.\nWhen we sign a collaboration agreement, license agreement or similar agreement with a collaborator to develop a product candidate, we will generally expect the collaborator to further the development of the product candidate, which could include the design and conduct of clinical trials, the preparation and filing of documents necessary to obtain regulatory approval, and the manufacturing, sale, marketing and other commercialization of the product if it obtains regulatory approval. We may also grant the collaborator certain rights. For example, under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Novartis, we granted Novartis certain exclusive, worldwide rights in specified intellectual property related to our atonal gene program and atonal adenovectors, as well as non-exclusive, world-wide rights to certain other intellectual property related to our hearing loss and balance disorders program and our adenovector platform related to the atonal gene. Novartis has the right to develop and commercialize any products related to the licensed intellectual property. Our dependence on a corporate collaborator, such as Novartis, subjects us to a number of risks, including that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that the collaborator devotes to the development or commercialization of product candidates or to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\nthe collaborator may not be successful in its efforts to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe collaborator may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\nthe collaborator may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\nchanges in the collaborator\u2019s business strategy may also adversely affect its willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u2022\nour agreement with the collaborator may fail to provide us with significant protection, or may not be effectively enforced, if a collaborator fails to perform;\n\u2022\nthe collaboration may be terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe collaborator could have the ability to unilaterally terminate agreements, or have extension or renewal rights, in instances that we believe are not commercially reasonable or consistent with our current business strategy; or\n\u2022\nthe collaborator may not be able to pay us as expected.\nGiven these risks, the success of our current and future collaborations is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative or positive impact on our business. If our collaborations fail, our product development or commercialization of product candidates could be delayed or cancelled, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCollaborations might produce conflicts that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our potential product candidates and negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nAn important part of our strategy involves conducting multiple product development programs. We may pursue opportunities in fields that conflict with those of our collaborators. In addition, disagreements with our collaborators could develop over rights to our intellectual property or rights to technology developed with our collaborators. The resolution of such conflicts and disagreements may affect ownership of intellectual property to which we believe we are entitled. In addition, any disagreement or conflict with our collaborators could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and negatively impact our relationship with existing collaborators. Such a conflict or disagreement could also lead to delays or termination of collaborative research, development, regulatory approval, or commercialization of various products or could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time consuming, expensive, lead to a diversion of management attention and resources and could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur collaboration agreements may prohibit us from conducting research in areas that may compete with our collaboration products, while our collaborators may not be limited to the same extent. This could negatively affect our ability to develop products and, ultimately, prevent us from achieving a continuing source of revenues.\nWe anticipate some of our corporate or academic collaborators will be conducting multiple product development efforts within each disease area that is the subject of their collaborations with us. In certain circumstances we have agreed not to conduct independently, or with any third party, certain research and development activities that are competitive with the research and development activities conducted under our collaborations. Therefore, our collaborations may limit the areas of research and development we may pursue alone or with others. Some of our collaborators, however, may develop, either alone or with others, products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of their collaborations with us. In addition, competing products, either developed by the collaborators or to which the collaborators have rights, may result in their withdrawing support for our product candidates.\nAgreements with government agencies may lead to claims against us under the federal False Claims Act, and these claims could result in substantial fines and other penalties.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is, and in recent years has been, under heightened scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and enforcement actions. Our agreements with U.S. government agencies or any\narrangement that implicates the payment of government funds may be subject to substantial financial penalties under the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the federal False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions, private enforcement of fraud claims against businesses on behalf of the U.S. government has increased due in part to amendments to the False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by private individuals, including present and former employees. The federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages and civil penalties of up to $11,000 per false claim. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nIf successful large-scale manufacturing of gene-based medicines is not possible, we or our collaborators may be unable to manufacture enough of our product candidates to achieve regulatory approval or market our products.\nFew companies to date have demonstrated successful large-scale manufacturing of gene-based medicines, including those that have had significantly more resources than we do and it is anticipated that significant challenges will be faced in the scale-up of our manufacturing process for commercial production. There are a limited number of contract manufacturers qualified to perform large-scale manufacturing of gene-based medicines. We or our collaborators may be unable to manufacture commercial-scale quantities of gene-base medicines or receive appropriate government approvals on a timely basis or at all. Failure to successfully manufacture or obtain appropriate government approvals on a timely basis or at all would prevent us from achieving our business objectives.\nIf regulatory approvals are not obtained for a manufacturing facility for our products, we may experience delays, be unable to meet demand, and may lose potential revenues.\nCompletion of clinical trials for and commercialization of our product candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates. We have limited experience manufacturing any of our gene-based products in the volumes that will be necessary to support large-scale clinical trials or commercial sales, and we expect that we will rely on our collaborators for manufacturing capabilities. Before we or our collaborators can begin commercial manufacturing of any of our product candidates, we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval of the manufacturing facility and process. Manufacturing of our proposed products must comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements and similar non-U.S. regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern, among other things, personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls and records and reports. Among other things, complying with cGMP and comparable non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require us to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping, and quality control to ensure the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We or our collaborators must also pass a preapproval inspection before FDA approval. Significant capital will likely need to be expended on the development of manufacturing capacity for a product candidate even before we know if the FDA will approve the product for commercialization. Furthermore, if we or our collaborators materially fail to comply with these requirements, our product candidates likely would not be approved. If we or our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements after approval, we would be subject to possible regulatory action (including warning letters, restrictions on the product, product recalls, suspension or withdrawal of approval, seizures, injunctions, civil fines, and criminal sanctions), and we may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products. The FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities generally have the authority to perform unannounced periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for some of our manufacturing materials. Any problems experienced by any of these suppliers could negatively impact our operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and vendors for some of the materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates. Some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor. For supply of early clinical trial materials, we rely on one supplier, Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation, for its cell culture medium and another supplier, Lonza Walkersville, Inc., for custom buffers. The cell culture medium is used to grow the cells within which our product candidates are produced. We do not currently have supply agreements with any of our suppliers. Any significant problem experienced by one of our suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until such supplier resolves the problem or an alternative source of supply is located. We have limited experience with alternative sources of raw materials. Any delay or interruption would likely lead to a delay or interruption of manufacturing operations, which could negatively affect our operations.\nWe face substantial competition from other companies and research institutions that are developing products to treat the same diseases that our product candidates target, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing other forms of treatment for the health concerns our product candidates target. We may also face competition from companies that may develop competing technology internally or acquire it from the government, universities or other research institutions. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop proprietary positions, which may prevent or limit our product commercialization efforts.\nSome of our competitors are established companies with greater financial and other resources than ours. Our competitors may succeed in:\n\u2022\nidentifying important genes or delivery mechanisms before we do;\n\u2022\ndeveloping products or product candidates earlier than we do;\n\u2022\nforming collaborations before we do or precluding us from forming collaborations with others;\n\u2022\nobtaining approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies, for such products more rapidly than we do;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and validating manufacturing processes more rapidly than we do;\n\u2022\nobtaining patent protection to other intellectual property rights that would limit or preclude our ability to use our technologies or develop products; or\n\u2022\ndeveloping products that are safer or more effective than those we develop or propose to develop.\nWhile we seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive, research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy developed by us.\nIn addition, our products, if approved, may subsequently face competition from biosimilar products that are approved via an abbreviated process on the basis of a showing that the product is highly similar to our approved product. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act provides periods of exclusivity during which abbreviated applications may not be submitted to, or approved by, the FDA, but the statute then allows approval by an abbreviated pathway and, if certain standards are met, a finding by the FDA that the biosimilar product is interchangeable with the reference product. A similar abbreviated approval process for biosimilars (but without the possibility of an interchangeability determination) is available in Europe. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars under an abbreviated regulatory approval process in the U.S. or Europe, our products may become subject to additional competition with the attendant pricing pressure. We also could face or be forced to bring litigation with respect to the validity or scope of patents relating to our products.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to compete with us.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining patent protection for our products and other technologies and successfully defending these patents against third party challenges. Our patent position,\nlike that of other biotechnology firms, is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The laws, rules, and regulations affecting biotechnology patent protection in the U.S. and other countries are uncertain and are currently undergoing review and revision. Changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the U.S. and other countries might allow others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our products without any compensation to us.\nOur ability to develop and protect a proprietary position based on biotechnological innovations and technologies involving genes and gene delivery systems, methods of use, production, formulations, and the like is particularly uncertain. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as patent offices in other countries, have often required that patent applications concerning biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially. Our disclosures in our patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability in all cases. In addition, other companies or institutions possess issued patents and have filed and will file patent applications that cover or attempt to cover genes, vectors, cell lines, and methods of making and using gene therapy products that are the same as or similar to the subject matter of our patent applications. For example, although we have pending patent applications pertaining to particular adenovectors that cannot reproduce themselves and adenovectors modified to alter cell binding characteristics, we are aware of issued patents and pending patent applications of other companies and institutions relating to the same subject matter. Patents and patent applications of third parties may have priority over our issued patents and our pending or yet to be filed patent applications. Proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and other patent offices to determine who properly lays claim to inventions are costly and time consuming, and we may not win in any such proceedings.\nThe issued patents we already have or may obtain in the future may not provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors. Other companies or institutions may challenge our or our collaborators\u2019 patents in the U.S. and in other countries. In the event a company, institution or researcher infringes upon our or our collaborators\u2019 patent rights, enforcing these rights may be difficult, expensive and time consuming, with no guarantee that our or our collaborators\u2019 patent rights will be upheld. Others may be able to design around these patents or develop unique products providing effects similar to our products. In addition, our competitors may legally challenge our patents, and they may be considered invalid. For example, we are also aware of issued patents and pending patent applications of third parties relating to aspects of production, purification, quality assessment, and formulation technology. It could be alleged that our production, purification, quality assessment, and formulation technology conflict with such existing or future patents.\nVarious components used in developing gene therapy products, such as particular genes, vectors, promoters, cell lines, and construction methods, used by others and by us, are available to the public. As a result, we are unable to obtain patent protection with respect to such components, and third parties can freely use such components. Third parties may develop products using such components that compete with our potential products. Also, with respect to some of our patentable inventions, we or our collaborators have decided not to pursue patent protection outside the U.S. Accordingly, our competitors could develop, and receive non-U.S. patent protection for, gene therapies or technologies for which we or our collaborators have or are seeking U.S. patent protection. Our competitors may be free to use these gene therapies or technologies outside the U.S. in the absence of patent protection.\nWe also rely to a limited extent on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we have entered into confidentiality agreements with employees and collaborators, we may not be able to prevent the disclosure or use of our trade secrets. In addition, other companies or institutions may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.\nIf our technologies and potential products conflict with intellectual property rights of competitors, universities, or others, then we may be prevented from licensing those technologies, developing those product candidates or both.\nOther companies and institutions have issued patents and have filed or will file patent applications that may issue into patents that cover or attempt to cover genes, vectors, cell lines, and methods of making and using gene and gene-based therapy products used in or similar to our product candidates and technologies. We also are aware of other issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to various aspects of our\nmanufacture of our product candidates and systems, and it could be alleged that our manufacture of these product candidates or licensure of those technologies conflicts with these patents. We have not conducted freedom-to-use patent searches on all aspects of our technologies, product candidates or potential product candidates, and we may be unaware of relevant patents and patent applications of third parties. In addition, the freedom-to-use patent searches that have been conducted may not have identified all relevant issued patents or pending patent applications that could issue into patents, particularly in view of the characterizations of the subject matter of issued patents and pending patent applications, as well as the fact that pending patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for a period of time and, in some circumstances, until issuance as patents.\nAn issued patent gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of validity under U.S. law and under the laws of some other countries. The holder of a patent to which we or our collaborators do not hold a license could bring legal actions against our collaborators or us for damages or to stop us or our collaborators from using the affected technology, which could limit or preclude our ability to license our technologies or to develop and commercialize our product candidates. If any of our potential products are found to infringe a patent of a competitor or third party, we or our collaborators may be required to pay damages and to either obtain a license in order to continue to develop and commercialize the potential products or, at the discretion of the competitor or third party, to stop development and commercialization of the potential products. Similarly, if any of our out-licensed technologies are found to infringe a patent of a competitor or third party, we or our collaborators may be required to pay damages and to either obtain a license in order to continue to utilize the technologies or, at the discretion of the competitor or third party, to stop utilizing the technologies. Since we have concentrated our resources on licensing certain of our technologies and developing only a limited number of products, the inability to license one of our technologies or to market one of our products would disproportionately affect us as opposed to a competing company with many products in development.\nWe believe there will be significant litigation in our industry regarding intellectual property rights. Many of our competitors have expended and are continuing to expend significant amounts of time, money and management resources on intellectual property litigation. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our resources and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, even if we ultimately are successful in such litigation.\nIf we lose our rights to use intellectual property we license from others, or those rights are not enforceable, then our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates will be harmed.\nWe rely, in part, on licenses to use some technologies material to our business. For example, to create our product candidates we combine our adenovectors with genes intended to produce therapeutic proteins. In most instances we do not own the patents or patent applications that cover these genes and certain methods of use thereof which underlie these licenses. For these genes, we do not control the enforcement of the patents. We rely upon our licensors to properly prosecute and file those patent applications and defend and enforce any issued patents.\nWhile many of the licenses under which we have rights provide us with exclusive rights in specified fields, the scope of our rights under these and other licenses may be subject to dispute by our licensors or third parties. In addition, our rights to use these technologies and practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not terminating them. Any of our licenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in breach of a term or condition of the license agreement or in certain other circumstances. In addition, some of our licenses are contingent upon our achievement of specific development milestones.\nLegal proceedings to obtain, enforce, and defend patents, and litigation of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend money and could impair our operations.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes, both in the U.S. and in other countries. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, however, can be highly uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the breadth of claims allowed in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields.\nProtecting intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights. Moreover, if a competitor were to file a patent application claiming technology also invented by us, we would have to participate in an interference proceeding before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of invention. We may be drawn into interferences with third parties or may have to provoke interferences ourselves to challenge third-party patent rights to allow us or our licensees to commercialize products based on our technologies. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management efforts regardless of the results of the litigation. An unfavorable result in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed, or require us to cease using some technologies.\nOur products and processes may infringe, or be found to infringe, patents not owned or controlled by us. Patents held by others may require us to alter our products or processes, obtain licenses or stop activities. If relevant claims of third-party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable, we could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in the patent. In addition, we may be required to obtain licenses, redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement or pay money damages. As a result, our business may suffer if we are not able to obtain licenses at all or on commercially reasonable terms to us or we are required to redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the clinical testing and manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products, and we may not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure. A product liability claim or recall could be detrimental to our business. Although we currently maintain product liability and clinical trial insurance, our present product liability and clinical trial insurance may be inadequate. Any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability and clinical trial insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms. In addition, product liability and clinical trial coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. A successful product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse events in the field of gene therapy may negatively affect regulatory approval or public perception of our products or product candidates.\nMost of our product candidates under development could be broadly described as recombinant DNA therapies. A number of clinical trials are being conducted by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies involving related therapies, including compounds similar to or competitive with, our product candidates. The announcement of adverse results from these clinical trials, such as serious adverse events or unexpected side effects attributable to the treatment, or any response by the FDA or other similar regulatory authority to such clinical trials, may impede the timing of our clinical trials, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval, impede our ability to secure additional funding, or negatively influence public perception of our product candidates. As a result, these conditions could harm our business and results of operations and depress the value of our stock.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend, in part, on public acceptance of the use of gene therapies for the prevention or treatment of significant health concerns. Public attitudes may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. Negative public reaction to gene therapy could result in greater government regulation and stricter clinical trial oversight and commercial product labeling requirements of gene therapy products and could cause a decrease in the demand for any products we may develop.\nOur product candidates involve new technologies and therapeutic approaches in the field of gene therapy, which is a new and evolving field. As discussed above, no gene therapy product has received regulatory approval in the U.S., and adverse events in this field may negatively affect public perception of our product candidates. Even if our product candidates attain regulatory approval, our success will depend upon the medical community, patients, and third-party payers accepting gene therapy products in general, and our\nproduct candidates in particular, as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. In particular, our success will depend upon whether physicians who specialize in the diseases our product candidates target decide to prescribe treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be available. Even if the clinical safety and efficacy of our product candidates is established, physicians may elect not to recommend our products for a variety of reasons, including the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers. Furthermore, third-party payers, such as health insurance plans, may be reluctant to authorize and pay for new forms of treatment they may deem expensive and less proven than existing treatments. Even if gene therapy products, and our product candidates in particular, are accepted by the medical community and third-party payers, the public in general, or patients in particular, may be uncomfortable with new therapies, including our product candidates, and it could take substantial time for them to accept gene therapy products as a viable treatment alternative, if ever. If gene therapy and our product candidates do not gain widespread acceptance, we may be unable to generate significant revenues, if any, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, even if our product candidates achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our product candidates or that render them obsolete.\nWe use hazardous biological materials in our business; any liability or disputes relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes involve the use of hazardous biological materials. Such materials include human and animal cell lines and viruses, such as adenoviruses and animals infected with human viruses. Some of the biological material may be novel, including viruses with novel properties. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, these hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets.\nAlthough we have general liability insurance, these policies contain exclusions from insurance against claims arising from pollution from chemical or radioactive materials. Our collaborators are working with these types of hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, we could be held responsible for any injury we or our collaborators cause to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, any hazardous materials. Although we believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental and occupational health and safety regulations, compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development, or production efforts.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is therefore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from our collaboration agreements with corporate partners, institutions, and governmental entities under which we may receive grants, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties, manufacturing revenue or payment for our development activities on behalf of third parties. We are particularly dependent on our agreement with Novartis, pursuant to which we are facilitating the development of first-in-class products for the treatment of hearing and balance disorders. On February 11, 2014, Novartis informed us that the third milestone under our agreement had been achieved after Novartis filed an IND with the FDA for the clinical development of CGF166, the lead product candidate under our collaboration. The IND was deemed effective on February 7, 2014, triggering a $2 million milestone payment to us. On October 28, 2014, the fourth milestone under our agreement with Novartis was achieved after the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CGF166, triggering a $3 million milestone payment to us. Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from the timing of clinical, regulatory or sales events which result in milestone payments and the timing and success of the commercial\nlaunch of new products by our collaboration partners. The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable collaboration partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we or our collaboration partner achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, whether the collaboration is exclusive or whether we can seek other partners, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets and the market introduction of new products or generic versions of the approved product, as well as other factors.\nWe depend on a limited number of collaborators for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of or significant reduction in business with those business partners could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nNovartis and the U.S. government accounted for approximately 80% and 83% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. While the concentration of our business with a small number of collaborators may provide certain benefits to us, it also exposes us to adverse effects in the event of a disruption in our relationship with any of them. We are particularly dependent on our agreement with Novartis. If Novartis or the U.S. government decreases business with us, fails to fulfill its obligations to us, or terminates its relationship with us, we could experience material adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including those based on recently enacted legislation, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we are able to commercialize our candidate products.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, \u201cPPACA\u201d), substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. PPACA contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal and private healthcare programs, increased rebates and taxes on pharmaceutical products, and revised fraud and abuse and enforcement requirements. These changes will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs.\nWe anticipate that if and when we or our collaborators commercialize our products in the U.S., a significant portion of our revenue and the revenue from our collaborators from sales of our products will be derived from government payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) programs. Reimbursement rates to purchasers of our drugs and our net revenues for sales of drugs used by these programs can be altered by legislation or regulation. PPACA and other federal law require rebates on certain drugs utilized under Medicare, Medicaid, and DoD programs and require discounts on certain drugs furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. For example, as part of PPACA\u2019s provisions closing a funding gap that currently exists in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d), once we or our collaborators participate in the Medicare program, we or our collaborators will be required to provide a 50% discount on branded prescription drugs dispensed to beneficiaries within this donut hole.\nPPACA also made changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed further herein, including changing the definition of AMP, expanding rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well, and increasing the minimum rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the AMP for most innovator products and from 11% to 13% for non-innovator products. We expect that the increased minimum rebate of 23.1% will apply to our products following commercialization, if successful, in the U.S. Furthermore, PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of\u2009\u2009$4.0 billion in 2017, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law.\nThe effects of reforms under PPACA will be shaped significantly by implementing regulations and by state government decisions. On February 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, issued a final regulation to implement the changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program under PPACA. This regulation became effective on April 1, 2016. Many states have not chosen to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted by PPACA. It is unclear whether these states will choose to expand their programs in the future and whether there will be more uninsured patients than anticipated when Congress passed PPACA. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program as permitted by PPACA, there will be fewer insured patients overall. The reduction in the number of insured patients could impact the sales, business and financial condition following the commercialization, if successful, of our products in the U.S.\nPPACA also expanded the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing discount program. A pharmaceutical manufacturer must participate in the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating pharmaceutical manufacturer agrees to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B discounted ceiling price for the pharmaceutical manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. PPACA obligates the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the program and to ensure the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the program obligates a manufacturer to offer the ceiling price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report to the government the ceiling prices for its drugs. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, could further expand the 340B drug pricing program to include additional covered entities or could require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting. To the extent that PPACA and subsequent legislation, as discussed above, causes the statutory and regulatory definitions of AMP and the Medicaid rebate amount to change, these changes also impact the 340B discounted ceiling price.\nLegislative changes to PPACA and new or revised regulations remain possible and appear likely in the 115th Congress and under the Trump Administration. These changes could affect all of the PPACA-related policies discussed above and could have a significant effect on the number of insured patients in the U.S., the breadth of coverage under insurance plans, financing of healthcare, and reimbursement rates, which could impact our sales, business, and financial condition following the commercialization, if successful, of our products in the U.S.. We expect that PPACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nIn addition to PPACA, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payers to keep these costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for any product candidates that are approved or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third-party payers, or may increase the tax obligations on life sciences companies such as ours.\nThe healthcare industry, and thus our business, continues to be subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Applicable federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations may affect our ability to operate our business, particularly once third-party reimbursement becomes available for one or more of our products. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any health care items or service for which payment may be made, in\nwhole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Further, PPACA clarified that liability may be established under the federal Anti-Kickback Law without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA amended the Social Security Act to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Law protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient assistance programs.\n\u2022\nThe federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Many healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities including causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved and thus non-reimbursable uses, inflating prices reported to private price publication services which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs and other interactions with customers including those that may have affected their billing or coding practices and submission to the federal government. In addition, PPACA amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.\n\u2022\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n\u2022\nNumerous federal and state laws and regulations that address privacy and data security, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\n\u2022\nThe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires certain pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the payment data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.\n\u2022\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payer. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct.\n\u2022\nThe federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, failure to achieve and sustain compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nIf third party payers do not provide coverage or reimbursement for our products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nEven if a product of ours receives regulatory approval, our success will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from third party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, other government health programs, private health insurers, managed care programs, and other organizations. Third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and this trend is expected to continue. Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the coverage or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products. Additional federal or state health care legislation may be adopted in the future, any products that we seek to commercialize may not be considered cost-effective, and limitations on coverage and the amount of reimbursement for our products could be imposed. Adequate third-party insurance coverage may not be available for us to establish and maintain price levels that are sufficient for realization of an appropriate\nreturn on our investment in product development. Moreover, the existence or threat of cost control measures, including a reduction in reimbursement rates could cause potential corporate collaborators to be less willing or able to pursue research and development programs related to our product candidates. We cannot be certain that, if and when our products become commercialized, the pertinent reimbursement amounts or formulary status for our products will be sufficient to enable us to market and sell our products.\nOur business involves animal testing and changes in laws, regulations, accepted clinical procedures, or social pressures could restrict our use of animals in testing and adversely affect our research and development efforts.\nMany of the research and development efforts we sponsor involve the use of laboratory animals. Changes in laws, regulations, or accepted clinical procedures may adversely affect these research and development efforts. Social pressures that would restrict the use of animals in testing or actions against us or our partners by groups or individuals opposed to testing using animals could also adversely affect these research and development efforts. In addition, preclinical animal studies conducted by us or third parties on our behalf may be subject to the FDA\u2019s Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d) regulations and the USDA regulations for certain animal species. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could extend or delay clinical trials conducted for our drug candidates.\nOur stock price could continue to be highly volatile and investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of many other life sciences companies, has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. For the period January 1 to February 28, 2017, the closing price of our stock price ranged from $3.20 to $8.79. The following factors, among others, could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nprogress and results of our preclinical studies and future clinical trials or announcements regarding our plans for future studies or trials, or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nevidence or lack of evidence of the safety or efficacy of our potential products or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncement by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new products;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our patent or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors, including litigation and challenges to our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical developments, natural or man-made disease threats, or other events beyond our control;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign governmental regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nchanges or announcements in reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for life science stocks in general;\n\u2022\nchanges in the collective short interest in our stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our performance by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\nour cash balances, need for additional capital, and access to capital.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will have any net income for the foreseeable future and accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any return on an investment in our Company will be realized, if at all, only when you sell shares of our common stock.\nWe are at risk of securities-related litigation due to our expected stock price volatility.\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially acute for us because life science companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and, as a result, have been subject to, on average, a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries. We may be the target of securities-related litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could seriously harm our business.\nWe depend on our key technical and management personnel to advance our technology and implement our business strategy, and the loss of these personnel could impair the development of our products and business.\nWe rely, and will continue to rely, on our key management and scientific staff, all of whom are employed at will. Our success depends upon the ability of our senior management to implement our business strategy. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There is intense competition from other companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. If we do not succeed in retaining and recruiting necessary personnel or developing this expertise, our business could suffer significantly. Furthermore, changes in our senior management may lead to instability for our Company which could cause our business to suffer significantly.\nWe have implemented anti-takeover provisions that could discourage or prevent a takeover, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified Board of Directors requiring that members of the board be elected in different years, which lengthens the time needed to elect a new majority of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of\u2009 \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares or change the balance of voting control and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent and requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing 90- to 120-day advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nWe have adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that is beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn August 2011, our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition beneficial to our stockholders by diluting the ability of a potential acquirer to acquire us. Pursuant to the terms of our plan, when a person or group (except under certain circumstances) acquires 20 percent or more of our outstanding common stock or 10 business days after commencement or announcement of a tender or exchange offer for 20 percent or more\nof our outstanding common stock (such person or group, an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d), the rights (except those rights held by the person or group who has acquired or announced an offer to acquire 20 percent or more of our outstanding common stock) would generally become exercisable for shares of our common stock at a discount. Because the potential acquirer\u2019s rights would not become exercisable for our shares of common stock at a discount, the potential acquirer would suffer substantial dilution and may lose its ability to acquire us. In addition, the existence of the plan itself may deter a potential acquirer from acquiring us. As a result, either by operation of the plan or by its potential deterrent effect, mergers and acquisitions of us that our stockholders may consider in their best interests may not occur.\nIn connection with the execution of our merger agreement with Intrexon Corporation (\u201cIntrexon\u201d), we amended the rights plan to provide that none of Intrexon, its merger subsidiary or any of their respective associates or affiliates shall become an Acquiring Person under the rights plan and to otherwise exempt the merger from triggering provisions or rights under the rights plan.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nWe have significant federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. However, our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may expire and not be used. Additionally, under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, as well as other pre-change tax attributes (e.g., research and experimentation tax credits), to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have previously experienced at least one ownership change and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership or future equity offerings. As of December 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $266 million that expire beginning in 2018 through 2036 that together with other tax attributes could expire unutilized or could be limited if we have experienced, or if in the future we experience, an ownership change.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and the issuance of debt or equity securities could adversely affect our common stockholders.\nWe are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. We may need to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business.\nWe have historically raised capital through the issuance of equity securities. We may also choose to issue debt securities. The issuance of debt or equity securities could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock. The issuance of debt or equity securities could also decrease the market price of our common stock or have terms and conditions that could discourage a takeover or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our shares or that our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all, through the issuance of equity or debt securities. If we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our research and development activities, we may not be able to continue operations, or we may have to enter into collaboration agreements that could require us to share commercial rights to our products to a greater extent or at earlier stages in the drug development process than is currently intended.\nRisks Related to the Merger Agreement with Intrexon\nFailure to consummate the merger could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nThe merger agreement with Intrexon (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) contains a number of customary conditions to closing, including the accuracy of Intrexon\u2019s and our representations and warranties to varying standards, the performance of each company\u2019s covenants, the absence of any legal prohibitions to closing, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our shareholders and certain other conditions. Many of the conditions to closing are not within either our control and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied.\nIf any condition to the merger is not satisfied or waived, it is possible that the merger will not be consummated in the expected time frame or at all. In addition, we or Intrexon may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances even if the merger is adopted and approved by or shareholders, including if the merger has not been completed, subject to certain conditions, on or before July 24, 2017. If the merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and the companies will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nhaving to pay all of the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger;\n\u2022\nhaving to pay, under certain circumstances, a termination fee equal to $550,000;\n\u2022\nhaving to reimburse, under certain circumstances, Intrexon for reasonable out of pocket expenses in an amount of up to $400,000 and to pay, in certain circumstances, an additional expense amount equal to $200,000; and\n\u2022\nfocusing our management on the proposed merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us, without realizing any of the benefits of having the proposed merger completed.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may be unable to find another party willing to engage in a similar transaction on terms as favorable as those set forth in the merger agreement, or at all. The negative publicity that could accompany such a termination could adversely impact our ability to find an alternate partner for a strategic transaction or to obtain required financing for any such transaction.\nIn addition, failure to complete the merger could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock to the extent that the current market price of those shares reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. In addition, neither company would realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the merger. Further, failure to complete the merger could result in damage to our reputation and business relationships. We could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to consummate the merger or related to any enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement.\nTherefore, a failure to consummate the merger could materially and adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price, and could limit each company\u2019s ability to pursue our strategic goals.\nWe suffered recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and, absent additional financing, we may be unable to remain a going concern.\nWe suffered recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit. If the merger with Intrexon is not consummated and we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital is not expected to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. In addition, our financial situation and the presence of an explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern could make it more difficult to raise the capital necessary to address our current needs.\nThe pendency of the merger could adversely affect our business and operations.\nSome of our collaborators may delay or defer decisions because of uncertainties or lack of understanding about the merger\u2019s potential effect on their businesses, which could negatively impact our revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the merger is completed. Similarly, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the merger and which may materially adversely divert attention from the daily activities of the Company and our existing employees.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we agreed not to, beginning on the date of the merger agreement, (i) solicit proposals relating to alternative acquisition proposals or (ii) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or provide non-public information to, any person relating to any such alternative acquisition proposal, subject to certain limited exceptions. Intrexon generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the proposed merger in response to any competing acquisition proposal that may be made before our Board of Directors may withdraw, or change, its recommendation to our shareholders.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, we would be required to pay Intrexon a termination fee equal to $550,000. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we would be required to compensate Intrexon for its actual reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses up to $400,000, plus an additional expense amount equal to $200,000.\nThese provisions could discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than that market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or might result in a third party proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that becomes payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and we decide to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on our business activities.\nThe merger agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the merger, and restricts us from taking certain specified actions until the merger is completed. These restrictions may prevent us from making desirable expenditures, including with regard to capital expenditures, pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.\nIf the proposed merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial costs that could adversely affect our financial results and operations and the market price of our common stock.\nIf the merger is not completed, our on-going business may be adversely affected. Without having realized any of the benefits of the merger, we will be subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay our costs relating to the proposed merger if the merger is not completed;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay a termination fee to Intrexon or to reimburse Intrexon for certain transaction-related expenses;\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement provides for certain restrictions on the operations of our business prior to the completion of the merger, which may affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the merger will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team, and our management team will not have devoted as much time and resources to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as a stand-alone company.\nWe may also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger. If the merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business, financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nIf the proposed merger is not completed, our ability to continue as a stand-alone company may be uncertain.\nOur ability to continue as a stand-alone company, including our ability to secure necessary funding for our operations, may face uncertainty if the merger is not completed. Our ability to execute on our operating strategy may also be affected by the failure to complete the merger. For example, potential licensees or other collaborators may be reluctant to enter into arrangements with us on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, because of any concerns regarding our long-term stability and plans raised by entering into the merger agreement and then failing to complete the merger. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully execute our operating strategy.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed and the our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the per share merger consideration Intrexon has agreed to provide in the merger.", "PERMNO": 88836, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "GNVC"}
