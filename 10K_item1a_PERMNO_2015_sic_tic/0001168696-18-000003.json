RISK FACTORS.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, you should consider the following factors.\nOur substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition.\nWe have substantial lease and debt obligations. If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional financing or sell assets. We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all. As a result, the inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations. Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate substantial operating cash flow. This will depend on future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our and our subsidiaries' cash flows prove inadequate to meet our and their debt service and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our and our subsidiaries' existing or future debt, on or before maturity, sell assets, obtain additional financing or\nsuspend the payment of dividends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness, sell any such assets or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe depend on motion picture production and performance and our relationships with film distributors.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and commercial appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets. We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which can depend on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios. Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of, these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations. In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.\nThe distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. In addition, the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with the top ten film distributors accounting for approximately 93% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2017. Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors. We are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films. A deterioration in our relationship with any of the major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.\nAn increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce our revenue.\nWe compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television. When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels during the theatrical release window. The average theatrical release window has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months over the last decade. Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether. We believe that a material contraction of the current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We can provide no assurance as to the impact or timing of any material contraction to the current theatrical release window.\nOur theatres operate in a competitive environment.\nThe motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry. Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites. Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.\nThe motion picture exhibition industry has and continues to implement various initiatives, concepts, customer amenities and technological innovations aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its patrons (including, but not limited to, luxury reclining seating, enhancement of food and alcoholic beverage offerings, the installation of premium format screens, digital 3D, 4DX, satellite distribution technologies and stadium seating). Theatres in our markets without these amenities may be more vulnerable to competition than those theatres with such amenities, and should other theatre operators choose to implement these or other initiatives in these markets, the performance of our theatres may be significantly and negatively impacted. In addition, while we continue to implement these and other initiatives, new innovations and technology will continue to impact our industry. If we are unable to respond to or invest in future technology and the changing preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could also adversely affect our results of operations. Finally, should other theatre operators embark on aggressive capital spending strategies, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.\nWe are currently the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and Attorneys General in several states and have been named as defendants in third party lawsuits related to similar matters.\nWe are currently the subject of an investigation by the DOJ regarding potentially anticompetitive conduct and coordination among NCM, AMC, the Company and/or Cinemark, under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 2. Additionally, we are the subject of investigations by various state attorneys general relating to our investments in various joint ventures, including NCM, as well as movie \u201cclearances\u201d whereby film distributors do not license the rights to\nexhibitors to play the same first-run feature length films at the same time in the same theatrical release zones. In addition, in the past, we have been named as defendants in lawsuits commenced by other theatre operators who claim the Company has engaged in anti-competitive conduct by virtue of these clearances.\nThe Company has cooperated with the Federal and state investigations that have been undertaken. While we do not believe that the Company has engaged in any violation of Federal or state antitrust or competition laws related to its investments in NCM, other joint ventures, or as pertains to movie clearances, and while the Company intends to vigorously defend any allegation that it has done so, we can provide no assurances as to the scope, timing or outcome of the DOJ\u2019s, any other state or Federal governmental reviews of the Company\u2019s conduct. If we are subject to an adverse finding or ruling resulting from any of these investigations, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have already incurred substantial legal expenses related to these matters and we may incur significant additional expenditures in the future. Furthermore, the period of time necessary to fully respond to and resolve these investigations is uncertain and could require significant management time and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business.\nWe may not benefit from our acquisition strategy and strategic partnerships.\nIdentifying suitable acquisition candidates and partnership opportunities may be difficult. In the case of acquisitions, even if we are able to identify suitable candidates, there can be significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that the Company would be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms. Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are. As a result of this competition for limited assets, there is no assurance that the Company could succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition. If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, there is no assurance that the Company could successfully expand its operations.\nIn any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits. Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions. If we cannot generate anticipated cash flows resulting from acquisitions or fail to realize their anticipated benefits, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected. Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of assimilating the acquired operations and personnel and integrating them into our current business;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention and other resources;\n\u2022\nthe possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of relationships with employees and landlords;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that any liabilities we may incur or assume may prove to be more burdensome than anticipated; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected.\nWe also maintain theatre-related investments and partnership opportunities that enhance and more fully leverage our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow. On a fully diluted basis, we own a 17.9% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2017. We also participate in other joint ventures such as DCIP, AC JV, Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition (\u201cDCDC\u201d) and Atom Tickets. Risks associated with pursuing these investments and opportunities include:\n\u2022\nthe difficulties and uncertainties associated with identifying investment and partnership opportunities that will successfully enhance and utilize our existing asset base in a manner that contributes to cost savings and revenue enhancement;\n\u2022\nour inability to exercise complete voting control over the partnerships and joint ventures in which we participate; and\n\u2022\nour partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, exercise their rights in a way that prohibits us from acting in a manner which we would like or they may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or similar agreements.\nAlthough we have not been materially constrained by our participation in National CineMedia or other joint ventures to date, no assurance can be given that the actions or decisions of other stakeholders in these ventures will not affect our investments in National CineMedia, DCIP, AC JV, DCDC and Atom Tickets or other existing or future ventures in a way that hinders our corporate objectives or reduces any anticipated improvements to our operating results and free cash flow.\nIn addition, any acquisitions or partnership opportunities are subject to the risk that the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or state or foreign competition authorities may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres or other assets in order to complete acquisition and partnership opportunities, pay damages and fines, or otherwise modify our normal operations as a result of our joint venture investments. The DOJ and various state attorneys general are currently investigating our investments in our various joint ventures, including NCM, for potentially anticompetitive conduct, as described more fully herein, and until such investigations are complete, we are not able to predict their outcome.\nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists, employee error or misconduct, viruses and other catastrophic events, leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to protect confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEconomic, political and social conditions could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nWe depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities. We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, theme parks, concerts, live theatre and restaurants. Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending. A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations. If economic conditions are weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres.\nTheatre attendance may also be affected by political events, such as terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States, health related epidemics and random acts of violence, any one of which could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and severe storms in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nAll of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business. A significant portion of our theatre level employees are paid at or slightly above the applicable minimum wage in the theatre's jurisdiction. Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.\nOur theatres must comply with the ADA to the extent that such properties are \"public accommodations\" and/or \"commercial facilities\" as defined by the ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations \"reasonably accommodate\" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to \"commercial facilities\" conform to accessibility guidelines unless \"structurally impracticable\" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.", "PERMNO": 89409, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "RGC"}
