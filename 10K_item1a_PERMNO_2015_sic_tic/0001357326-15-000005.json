{"cik": "1357326", "company": "Riverbed Technology, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public statements. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing and volatile U.S., European and global economic environment, and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. In addition, revenues in any quarter are largely dependent on customer contracts entered into during that quarter. Historically, the amount of customer orders that have not been shipped as of the end of a fiscal year has not been material. Moreover, a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last month of the quarter, and sometimes within the last few weeks or days of the quarter. As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term and a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, as has occurred recently and at other times in the past, or if the guidance we provide to the market falls below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, as has occurred recently and at other times in the past, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur, and has occurred recently and at other times in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and/or earnings guidance.\nIn addition to other risks listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nseasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services. For example, many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the first and third quarters; we have experienced these seasonal fluctuations in the past and expect that this trend will continue in the future;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in sales cycles and prices for our products and services;\n\u2022\nreductions in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic or political conditions in our domestic and international markets, including the deficit spending and government debt issues surrounding the U.S. and Eurozone economies;\n\u2022\nunpredictability in the development of core, new, or adjacent markets, or a slowdown or reversal of growth in these markets, including the wide area network (WAN) optimization, network and application performance management, and public cloud computing markets and including any markets that we enter as a result of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of OPNET;\n\u2022\nlimited visibility into customer spending plans;\n\u2022\nchanging market conditions, including current and potential customer consolidation;\n\u2022\ncustomer or partner concentration. For example, two value-added distributors each represented more than 10% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014;\n\u2022\nvariation in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products sold;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter as a result of revenue recognition accounting rules, including the extent to which sales transactions in a given period are unrecognizable until a future period or, conversely, the satisfaction of revenue recognition rules in a given period resulting in the recognition of revenue from transactions initiated in prior periods;\n\u2022\nthe sale of our products in the timeframes we anticipate, including the number and size of orders, and the product mix within any such orders, in each quarter;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and ship in a timely manner new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements;\n\u2022\nthe timing and execution of product transitions or new product introductions, including any related or resulting inventory costs;\n\u2022\ndelays in customer purchasing cycles in response to our introduction of new products or product transitions. For example, a product transition caused some of our customers to lengthen their purchasing decision in the first quarter of 2012 as they spent time evaluating new models. In addition, we experienced extended sales cycles in the first quarter of 2012 as some of our customers evaluated our SteelFusion (formerly Granite) product;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of new product introductions. For example, in the first quarter of 2012 we introduced SteelFusion, which delivers branch converged infrastructure. New products may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance or be accepted into our sales channel by our channel partners. Furthermore, many of our target customers have not purchased products similar to these and might not have a specific budget for the purchase of these products;\n\u2022\nin addition to OPNET, our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies or technologies, especially where those acquisitions result in our entering new markets. For example, in July 2011 we acquired Zeus Technology Ltd., a company that delivers high-performance software-based load balancing and traffic management solutions for virtual and cloud environments, and Aptimize Ltd., a web content optimization company;\n\u2022\nour ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic transaction undertaken by us, including any acquisition, divestiture, partnership, commercial agreement, or investment;\n\u2022\nthe timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including new entrants or substantial discounting of products;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the components we purchase;\n\u2022\nour ability to timely and effectively implement, and realize the anticipated benefits of, any restructuring plans, including those announced in October 2014;\n\u2022\nany component shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with channel partners, and the effectiveness of any changes we make to our distribution model;\n\u2022\nany decision to increase or decrease operating expenses in response to changes in the marketplace or perceived marketplace opportunities;\n\u2022\nour ability to derive benefits from our investments in sales, marketing, engineering or other activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully work with partners on combined solutions, including with respect to product validation, marketing, selling and support;\n\u2022\nvolatility in our stock price, which may lead to higher stock compensation expenses;\n\u2022\nunpredictable fluctuations in our effective tax rate due to the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses, disqualifying dispositions of stock from the employee stock purchase plan and stock options, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in actual results\nversus our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of natural disasters, including any effects on our supply chain or on the willingness of our customers or prospective customers to make capital commitments.\nIf the Merger does not occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including the receipt of approvals from our stockholders and from government or regulatory agencies. There is no assurance that all of the various conditions will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all.\nThe Merger gives rise to inherent risks that include:\n\u2022\npending stockholder litigation that could prevent or delay the Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations;\n\u2022\nthe price of our common stock will change if the Merger is not completed to the extent that the current market price of our stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash to be paid under the agreement governing the Merger is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations or in the event of any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock;\n\u2022\nlegal or regulatory proceedings, including regulatory approvals from various domestic and foreign governmental entities (including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these approvals) and the risk that one or more governmental entities may delay or deny approval, or other matters that affect the timing or ability to complete the transaction as contemplated;\n\u2022\nthe ability of Thoma Bravo and its affiliates to obtain the necessary funds to complete the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources;\n\u2022\ndifficulties maintaining business and operational relationships, including relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners;\n\u2022\nthe inability to attract and retain key personnel pending consummation of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make changes to our business pending the completion of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe requirement to pay a termination fee of $126 million if we terminate the agreement governing the Merger under certain circumstances;\n\u2022\ndevelopments beyond our control including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or global economic conditions that may affect the timing or success of the Merger; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that if the Merger is not completed, the market price of our common stock could decline, investor confidence could decline, shareholder litigation could be brought against us, relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners may be adversely impacted, we may be unable to retain key personnel, and profitability may be adversely impacted due to costs incurred in connection with the proposed Merger.\nAdverse economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and may lead to reduced information technology spending, which would harm our business and operating results. In addition, turmoil in credit markets during economic downturns increases our exposure to our customers' and partners' credit risk, which could result in reduced revenue or increased write-offs of accounts receivable.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology, and in particular for WAN optimization and the other markets in which we operate, and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers, both enterprises and government organizations, to make capital commitments.\nThese government organizations include non-U.S. as well as U.S. federal, state and local organizations. In some quarters, sales to government organizations have represented, and may in the future represent, a significant portion of overall sales. If the conditions in the U.S. and global economic environment, including the economies of any international markets that we serve, remain uncertain or continue to be volatile, or if they deteriorate further, our business, operating results, and financial condition would likely be materially adversely affected. For example, U.S. government deficit spending and debt levels, as well as actions taken by the U.S. Congress relating to these matters, could negatively impact the U.S. and global economies and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, our financial results could be negatively impacted by the continuing uncertainty surrounding, or any deterioration relating to, the debt levels or growth prospects for Eurozone economies.\nEconomic weakness, customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on IT initiatives have resulted, and may in the future result, in challenging and delayed sales cycles and could negatively impact our ability to forecast future periods. In addition, the markets we serve are emerging and the purchase of our products involves material changes to established purchasing patterns and policies. The purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. In addition, our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to be, fixed in the short-term. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Weak or volatile economic conditions would likely harm our business and operating results in a number of ways, including information technology spending reductions among customers and prospects, longer sales cycles, lower prices for our products and services and reduced unit sales. A reduction in information technology spending could occur or persist even if economic conditions improve. In addition, any increase in worldwide commodity prices may result in higher component prices and increased shipping costs, both of which may negatively impact our financial results.\nMany of our customers and channel partners use third parties to finance their purchases of our products. Any freeze, or reduced liquidity, in the credit markets may result in customers or channel partners either delaying or entirely foregoing planned purchases of our products if they are unable to obtain the required financing. This would result in reduced revenues, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, these customers' and partners' ability to pay for products already purchased may be adversely affected by any credit market turmoil or an associated downturn in their own business, which in turn could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition that could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Other companies may introduce new products in the same markets we serve or intend to enter.\nThis competition could result, and has resulted in the past, in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which would likely seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCompetitive products may in the future have better performance, more and/or better features, lower prices and broader acceptance than our products. Many of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. Currently, in the WAN Optimization market we face competition from a number of established companies, including Cisco Systems, Blue Coat Systems, Citrix Systems, and Networks. We also face competition from a large number of smaller private companies and new market entrants. In the Network Performance Management and Application Performance Management markets, our Riverbed Performance Management product line primarily competes with Netscout, Computer Associates (NetQos), and Compuware.\nWe expect increased competition from our current competitors as well as other established and emerging companies if our market continues to develop and expand. For example, third parties currently selling our products could market products and services that compete with our products and services. In addition, some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships with one another to offer a more comprehensive solution than they individually had offered. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies enter into partnerships or are acquired. Many of the companies driving this consolidation trend have significantly greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do and are better positioned to acquire and offer complementary products and technologies. The companies resulting from these possible consolidations may create more\ncompelling product offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility, making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology, or product functionality. Continued industry consolidation may adversely impact customers' perceptions of the viability of smaller and even medium-sized technology companies and consequently customers' willingness to purchase from such companies. These pressures could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also face competitive pressures from other sources. For example, Microsoft has improved, and has announced its intention to further improve, the performance of its software for remote office users. Our products are designed to improve the performance of many applications, including applications that are based on Microsoft protocols. Accordingly, improvements to Microsoft application protocols may reduce the need for our products, adversely affecting our business, operating results, and financial condition. Improvement in other application protocols or in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the underlying transport protocol for most WAN traffic, could have a similar effect. In addition, we market our products, in significant part, on the anticipated cost savings to be realized by organizations if they are able to avoid the purchase of costly IT infrastructure at remote sites by purchasing our products. To the extent other companies are able to reduce the costs associated with purchasing and maintaining servers, storage or applications to be operated at remote sites, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of stockholders or others.\nIn January 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had rejected an unsolicited proposal by Elliott Management Corporation (Elliott) to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock, and Elliott has made several public statements that were critical of the Board of Directors, Riverbed, and our management team. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism, potential changes to the composition of the Board of Directors, or other developments may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or other instability, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or do business with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on channel partners to sell our products. Disruptions to, or our failure to effectively implement, develop and manage, our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could harm our business.\nOur future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of channel partners, including value-added resellers, value-added distributors, service providers, and systems integrators. A substantial majority of our revenue (90% in 2014 and 85% in 2013) is derived from indirect channel sales and we expect indirect channel sales to continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue. We employ a two-tier distribution strategy, as part of a larger effort to scale our reach and better serve the needs of our channel. Our revenue depends in large part on the effective performance of these channel partners, and changes to our distribution model, the loss of a channel partner, or the reduction in sales to our channel partners could materially reduce our revenues and gross margins. By relying on indirect channels, we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products, thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness, ensure proper delivery and installation of our products, service ongoing customer requirements, and respond to evolving customer needs. In addition, we recognize a large portion of our revenue based on a sell-through model using information regarding the end user customers that is provided by our channel partners. If those channel partners provide us with inaccurate or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted. For example, we have encountered delays with certain partners where internal processing issues have prevented that partner from providing a purchase order to us in a timely manner.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources. These recruitment, retention, and training efforts have assumed even greater importance as we have evolved into a multi-product company. In order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channel, including investment in systems and training, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage. In particular, training and educating our channel partners has become more complex as we have introduced products that extend beyond core WAN optimization. We have no minimum purchase commitments with any of our value-added resellers or other indirect distributors, and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with\nours. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to existing and potential channel partners to favor their products, to choose not to partner with us, or to prevent or reduce sales of our products. Our channel partners may choose not to offer our products exclusively or at all. If we fail to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners, fail to develop new relationships with channel partners in new markets or expand the number of channel partners in existing markets, fail to manage, train or motivate existing channel partners effectively, or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products would decrease and our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nWe expect our gross margins to vary over time and our recent level of gross margin may not be sustainable. In addition, our gross margins may be adversely affected by our introductions of new products.\nOur gross margins vary from quarter to quarter and the recent level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors, including but not limited to product or sales channel mix shifts, increased price competition, increases in material or labor costs, excess product component or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers, write-downs for obsolete or excess inventory, increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to component holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand, warranty-related issues, product discounting, freight charges, or our introduction of new products or new product platforms or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures.\nAny introduction of, and transition to, a new product line requires us to forecast customer demand for both legacy and new product lines for a period of time, and to maintain adequate inventory levels to support the sales forecasts for both product lines. If new product line sales, or product line sales in general, exceed our sales forecast, we could possibly experience stock shortages, which would negatively affect our revenues. If legacy product line sales, or product lines sales in general, fall short of our sales forecast, we could have excess inventory, as has occurred from time to time. Any inventory charges would negatively impact our gross margins.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our revenue is difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter.\nThe timing of our revenue is difficult to predict. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefit of our products, including their technical capabilities and potential cost savings to an organization. Customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process that has in the past resulted in a lengthy sales cycle, in some cases over twelve months. Also, as our channel model distribution strategy evolves, utilizing value-added resellers, value-added distributors, systems integrators and service providers, and as the breadth of our product offerings increases, the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions may increase and make it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions. For example, we recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extended sales cycles as a result of the additional complexity inherent in selling multiple product offerings in one transaction or a series of related transactions. We spend substantial time and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that these endeavors will produce any sales. Even after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately. In addition, product purchases are frequently and increasingly subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays.\nCustomers may also defer purchases as a result of anticipated or announced releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or by us. In the past, we experienced delays in customer purchasing cycles in response to our introduction of new products or product transitions; we expect that this trend will continue in the future. Product purchases may be, and in the recent past have been, delayed by the volatile U.S. and global economic environment, which introduced additional risk into our ability to accurately forecast sales in a particular quarter. If sales expected from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, revenue will be harmed and we may miss our stated guidance for that period.\nIf we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe may not be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs, either on a timely basis or at all. For example, our failure to address additional application-specific protocols, particularly if our competitors are able to provide such functionality, could harm our business. In addition, our inability to diversify beyond our current product offerings could adversely affect our\nbusiness. Any new products or product enhancements that we introduce, including by way of acquisitions, may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance or be accepted into our sales channel by our channel partners, which would adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction, or may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new or enhanced products, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business and cause dilution to our stockholders.\nDuring 2012 we acquired OPNET. We have made other acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies, and in the future we may acquire additional businesses, products, or technologies. Our ability as an organization to integrate acquisitions is unproven. Any acquisitions that we complete may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, or the acquisition may be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in integrating personnel, operations, technologies, or products from the acquired businesses and in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses. We may also encounter difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies across locations, or in managing geographically or culturally diverse locations. We may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with acquired or integrated product quality or technology. Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from day-to-day responsibilities and increase our expenses. Acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in an increase in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt.\nWe rely on third parties to perform shipping and other logistics functions on our behalf. A failure or disruption at a logistics partner would harm our business.\nWe use third-party logistics partners to perform storage, packaging, shipment and handling for us. It is time-consuming and costly to qualify and implement relationships with new logistics partners. Therefore, if one or more of our logistics partners suffers an interruption in its business, or experiences delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in its operations, or we choose to change or add additional logistics partners, our ability to ship products to our customers would be delayed and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe are susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain. Any shortages or price fluctuations in components used in our products could delay shipment of our products or increase our costs and harm our operating results.\nWe use various hardware components in our products that are sourced from third parties. Shortages in components that we use in our products have occurred recently and may occur in the future and our suppliers' ability to predict the availability of such components may be limited. Some components that we use are available only from limited sources of supply. Replacing a component that is used in our products with a different component may require establishing a new supply relationship with a third-party and may also require extensive testing and qualification before the replacement component may be used, both of which may be costly and time-consuming. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantity requirements and delivery schedules. The unavailability of any component that is necessary to the proper functioning of our appliances would prevent us from shipping products. Any inability to ship our products in a timely manner would delay sales and adversely impact our revenue, business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny growth in our business or the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to project overall component demand accurately and to establish optimal component inventory levels. In addition, increased demand by third parties for the components we use in our products may lead to decreased availability and higher prices for those components. We carry limited inventory of our product components, and we rely on suppliers to deliver components in a timely manner based on forecasts we provide. We rely on both purchase orders and long-term contracts with our suppliers, but we may not be able to secure sufficient components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality, which would seriously impact our ability to deliver products to our customers and, as a result, adversely impact our revenue.\nIf we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which would harm our business. We are dependent on contract manufacturers, and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could harm our business.\nWe depend on independent contract manufacturers to manufacture and assemble our products. We rely on purchase orders or long-term contracts with our contract manufacturers. Some of our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantity, or at any specific price. Our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by our contract manufacturers from their customers. As a result, fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority by one or more of our contract manufacturers in the event the contract manufacturer is constrained in its ability to fulfill all of its customer obligations in a timely manner. We provide demand forecasts and purchase orders to our contract manufacturers. To the extent that any such demand forecast or purchase order is binding, if we overestimate our requirements, the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. Conversely, because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms, and the demand for each component at a given time, if we underestimate our requirements, the contract manufacturers may have inadequate materials and components required to produce our products, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenue.\nIt is time-consuming and costly to qualify and implement contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if one or more of our contract manufacturers suffers an interruption in its business, or experiences delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations, or we choose to change or add additional contract manufacturers, our ability to ship products to our customers would be delayed and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, a portion of our manufacturing is performed overseas and is subject to risks associated with doing business in other countries.\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems, and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business.\nMany of our business processes depend upon our information technology systems (IT), the systems and processes of third parties, and on interfaces with the systems of third parties. For example, our order entry system provides information to the systems of our contract manufacturers, which enables them to build and ship our products. If those systems fail or are interrupted, or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all. This would harm our ability to ship products, and our financial results would likely be harmed.\nIn addition, reconfiguring our IT systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs, or in connection with integrating acquired businesses, may be time-consuming and costly. To the extent this impacts our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities, our financial results would likely be harmed.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the U.S. Further, with respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents are issued, they may be contested, circumvented or invalidated over the course of our business. The invalidation of any of our key patents could benefit our competitors by allowing them to more easily design products similar to ours. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and competitors may in any event be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks, and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to\ndetermine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. For example, we are currently engaged in patent infringement litigation against Silver Peak Systems, in which both we and Silver Peak Systems assert patent infringement by the other party. Intellectual property litigation has resulted, and may in the future result, in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, and may in the future harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could harm our business.\nOur industry is, and any industry or market that we may enter in the future may be, characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and we cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims. Third parties have claimed and may in the future claim that our products or technology infringe their proprietary rights. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in any of our markets increases and overlaps occur. In addition, as we have gained greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. Any claim of infringement by a third-party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial legal costs defending against the claim, and could distract our management from our business. Furthermore, we could be subject to a judgment or voluntarily enter into a settlement, either of which could require us to pay substantial damages. A judgment or settlement could also include an injunction, a court order or other agreement that could prevent us from offering our products. For example, in April 2014, Silver Peak Systems received a verdict of infringement by us relating to two patents; although an initial injunction request was denied, Silver Peak Systems may continue to seek an injunction against our continued offering of certain features on our SteelHead products. In addition, we might elect or be required to seek a license for the use of third-party intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if available, the payments under such license may harm our operating results and financial condition. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers and channel partners. Any of these claims would require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because we generally indemnify our customers and channel partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties. If any of these claims succeed, or if we voluntarily enter into a settlement, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or channel partners, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we derived 43%, 41% and 45%, respectively, of our revenue from customers outside the U.S. We have personnel in numerous countries worldwide. We expect to continue to add personnel in additional countries. Our international sales and operations makes us subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, data protection, and business dealings with both commercial and governmental officials and organizations. Our international sales and operations subject us to a variety of additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and cost of managing and staffing international offices and the increased travel, infrastructure, legal, and other compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\nthe effects of any political instability on the general willingness of our current and prospective customers to make capital commitments;\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk; and\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international sales and operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully, or to comply with these laws and regulations, could harm our operations, reduce our sales, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in certain foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, certain business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, may be more commonplace. Although we implement policies and procedures with the intention of ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as channel partners involved in our international sales, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nSome of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nForeign currencies periodically experience rapid fluctuations in value against the U.S. dollar. Any foreign currency devaluation against the U.S. dollar increases the real cost of our products to our customers and partners in foreign markets where we sell in U.S. dollars, which has resulted in the past and may result in the future in delayed or cancelled purchases of our products and, as a result, lower revenues. In addition, this increase in cost increases the risk to us that we will be unable to collect amounts owed to us by such customers or partners, which in turn would impact our revenues and could materially adversely impact our business and financial results. Any devaluation may also lead us to more aggressively discount our prices in foreign markets in order to maintain competitive pricing, which would negatively impact our revenues and gross margins. Conversely, a weakened U.S. dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we purchase components in foreign currencies.\nStarting in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast expenses denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. As a result, we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities if our forecasts are incorrect. In addition, our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our profitability.\nInternational customers may also require that we localize our products. The product development costs for localizing the user interface of our products, both graphical and textual, could be a material expense to us if the software requires extensive modifications. To date, such changes have not been extensive, and the costs have not been material.\nWe are investing in engineering, sales, marketing, services, and infrastructure, and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits, which could harm our operating results.\nWe intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to our engineering, sales, marketing, services and infrastructure functions as we focus on developing new technologies, growing our market segments, capitalizing on existing or new market opportunities, increasing our market share, and enabling our business operations to meet anticipated demand. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain personnel on a cost-effective basis, our business would be harmed.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon the performance of our senior management and key technical and sales personnel. Our management and employees can terminate their employment at any time, and the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. Our success also is substantially dependent upon our ability to attract additional personnel for all areas of our organization, particularly in our sales, research and development, and customer service departments. Competition for qualified\npersonnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. Additionally, fluctuations or a sustained decrease in the price of our stock could affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. When our stock price declines, our equity incentive awards may lose retention value, which may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain such key personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary technical, sales and other personnel on a cost-effective basis, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments.\nDeveloping our products is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle or may not generate additional revenue at all. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our research and development expenses were $205.6 million, or approximately 19% of our total revenue. Our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. These investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.\nOur ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings, and our failure to offer high quality support and services would harm our operating results and reputation.\nOnce our products are deployed within our customers' networks, our customers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our products. A high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products. If we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and provide effective ongoing support, it would adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing customers and would harm our reputation with potential customers. In addition, as we expand our operations internationally, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high quality support and services would harm our operating results and reputation.\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe have expanded our operations significantly since inception, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, and anticipate that further significant expansion will be required. This growth is expected to continue to place significant demands on our management, infrastructure, and other resources. To manage our growth, we need to hire, integrate, and retain highly skilled and motivated employees. We will also need to continue to improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures. We have an enterprise resource planning software system that supports our finance, sales, and inventory management processes. If we were to encounter delays or difficulties as a result of this system, including loss of data and decreases in productivity, our ability to properly run our business could be adversely impacted. If we do not effectively manage our growth, our business would be harmed.\nOrganizations are increasingly concerned with the security of their data, and to the extent they elect to encrypt data being transmitted from the point of the end user in a format that we're not able to decrypt, rather than only across the WAN, our WAN optimization products will become less effective.\nOur WAN optimization products are designed to remove the redundancy associated with repeated data requests over a WAN, either through a private network or a virtual private network (VPN). The ability of our WAN optimization products to reduce redundancy depends on our products' ability to recognize the data being requested. Our WAN optimization products currently detect and decrypt some forms of encrypted data. Since most organizations currently encrypt most of their data transmissions only between sites and not on the LAN, the data is not encrypted when it passes through our WAN optimization products. For those organizations that elect to encrypt their data transmissions from the end-user to the server in a format that we are not able to decrypt, our WAN optimization products will offer limited performance improvement unless we are successful in incorporating additional functionality into our products that address those encrypted transmissions. Our failure to provide such additional functionality could limit the growth of our business and harm our operating results.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers' infrastructure, installations could be delayed or cancelled, which would harm our business.\nOur products must interoperate with our customers' existing infrastructure, which often have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the\nhardware used in our customers' infrastructure or problematic network configurations or settings, as we have in the past, we may have to modify our software or hardware so that our products will interoperate with our customers' infrastructure. In such cases, and others, our products may be unable to provide significant performance improvements for applications deployed in our customers' infrastructure. These issues could cause longer installation times for our products and could cause order cancellations, either of which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, government and other customers may require our products to comply with certain security or other certifications and standards. If our products are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our products to such customers, or at a competitive disadvantage, which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products, organizations may decide against adding our products to their network, which would harm our business.\nOther providers of network infrastructure products, including our partners, are offering or announcing functionality aimed at addressing the problems addressed by our products. For example, Cisco Systems incorporates WAN optimization functionality into certain of its router blades. The inclusion of, or the announcement of intent to include, functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our products in products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture or in products that are sold by more established vendors may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products. Furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products, a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor. Many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of network infrastructure products, which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks, particularly from new vendors. In addition, an organization's existing vendors or new vendors with a broader product offering than ours may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer a relatively focused line of products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors. If organizations are reluctant to add network infrastructure products from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nOur products are highly technical and may contain undetected software or hardware errors or security vulnerabilities. These errors or security vulnerabilities, and any related claims against our products, could cause harm to our reputation and our business.\nOur products, including software product upgrades and releases, are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, are critical to the operation of many networks. Our products have contained and may contain undetected errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities. In particular, new products and product platforms may be subject to increased risk of hardware issues. Some errors in our products may be discovered only after a product has been installed and used by customers. Some of these errors may be attributable to third-party technologies incorporated into our products, which makes us dependent upon the cooperation and expertise of such third-parties for the diagnosis and correction of such errors. The diagnosis and correction of third-party technology errors is particularly difficult where our product features the RSP or VSP, because it is not always immediately clear whether a particular error is attributable to a technology incorporated into our product or to third-party software deployed by our customers on our product. In addition, where we have incorporated technology from a third-party, the solutions may be more complex and may lead to new technical errors that may prove difficult to diagnose and support. Any delay or mistake in the initial diagnosis of an error will result in a delay in the formulation of an effective action plan to correct such error. Any errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could harm our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. Any such errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities could also adversely affect the market's perception of our products and business. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty, including claims relating to changes to our products made by our channel partners. Our contracts with customers contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management's attention and harm the market's perception of us and our products. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur use of open source and third-party software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe incorporate open source software into our products. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or other courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. We could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products. In either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also incorporate certain third-party technologies, including software programs, into our products and may need to utilize additional third-party technologies in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, we could face delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current products. These delays, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We currently use third-party software programs in our appliance and software products, some of which are currently available from only one vendor. Any disruption in our access to these or other software programs or third-party technologies could result in significant delays in our product releases and could require substantial effort to locate or develop a replacement program. If we decide in the future to incorporate into our products any other software program licensed from a third-party, and the use of such software program is necessary for the proper operation of our products, then our loss of any such license would similarly adversely affect our ability to release our products in a timely fashion.\nWe are subject to various regulations that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to sell our products.\nOur products and services are subject to a variety of government regulations, including export controls, import controls, environmental laws, laws relating to the use of conflict minerals, and required certifications. For example, our products are subject to export controls of the U.S. and other countries and may be exported outside the U.S. and other countries only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception, because we incorporate encryption technology into our products. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers' ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in regulations may increase the cost of building and selling our products, create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in regulations, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. We must comply with various and increasing environmental regulations, both domestic and international, regarding the manufacturing and disposal of our products. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur sales to United States government customers subject us to special risks that could adversely affect our business.\nWe sell our products directly or indirectly to the United States government and, in connection with such sales, we must comply with complex federal procurement and related laws and regulations, which may impose added costs on our business. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 9.9% of our sales constituted sales made directly or indirectly to the United States government. The federal government audits and reviews the performance of federal contractors regarding contract terms, pricing practices, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. Such an audit could result in an adverse finding, including a finding that we overcharged the government or failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If a government audit or other investigation results in an adverse finding or uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be required to restate previously reported operating results or we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with United States federal government agencies. We could face additional expense and delay if any of our competitors, or competitors of the prime contractors to which we serve as\nsubcontractors, protest or challenge contract awards made to us or to our prime contractors pursuant to competitive bidding. In addition, United States government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government customers with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts; these remedies include rights to terminate for convenience on short notice, reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts, and claim rights in products and technology produced by us.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from regulations regarding corporate governance practices and costs relating to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For example, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to independent directors, audit and compensation committees, distribution of annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, stockholder approvals, solicitation of proxies, conflicts of interest, stockholder voting rights and codes of conduct. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains various provisions applicable to the corporate governance functions of public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nWe are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we test our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure control and procedures. In particular, for the year ended December 31, 2014, we performed system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in the future, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock may decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require significant additional financial and management resources.\nChanges in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules, or changes to the interpretations of existing rules, could lead to changes in our accounting practices, and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nWe are required to expense equity compensation given to our employees, which has reduced our reported earnings, will harm our operating results in future periods and may reduce our stock price and our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees.\nWe historically have used stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan as significant components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees' interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention, and provide competitive compensation packages. The compensation charges that we are required to record related to these equity awards have reduced, and will continue to reduce, our reported earnings, will harm our operating results in future periods, and may require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees, which could make it more difficult for us to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Moreover, if securities analysts, institutional investors and other investors adopt financial models that include stock option expense in their primary analysis of our financial results, our stock price could decline as a result of reliance on these models with higher expense calculations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible stock-based compensation, changes in the research and development tax credit laws, earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, transfer pricing adjustments, not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. In addition, like other companies, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully manage our exposure to the volatility and economic uncertainty in the global financial marketplace, our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nWe are exposed to financial risk associated with the global financial markets, including volatility in interest rates and uncertainty in the credit markets. Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the outstanding balance of our $600.0 million credit facility and our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, maintain adequate liquidity and portfolio diversification while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. However, the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities that we hold, interest rate changes, the ongoing strength and quality, and recent instability, of the global credit market, and liquidity. If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments. Additionally, instability and uncertainty in the financial markets, as has been recently experienced, could result in the incurrence of significant realized or impairment losses associated with certain of our investments, which would reduce our net income.\nIf we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have historically relied on outside financing and cash flow from operations to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion, most recently through establishment of a $600.0 million credit facility. We may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities. We may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of our current senior secured credit facility include certain covenants that limit future borrowings and require that certain payments, investments and acquisitions meet defined leverage ratios, and any additional financing may place additional limits on our financial and operating flexibility. The terms of our current senior secured credit facility include financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum consolidated interest coverage and maximum consolidated leverage ratios. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe have taken on significant debt, which will decrease our business flexibility and increase our interest expense.\nWe currently have a balance of $510.0 million related to our $600.0 million credit facility. This debt, together with certain covenants imposed on us in connection with incurring this debt, among other things, limits how we conduct our business, reduces our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increases our interest expense. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, the covenants in our credit facility limit our ability to, among other things, obtain additional\nfinancing, make acquisitions or other investments, repurchase our stock or pay dividends. These limitations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods, pandemics and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as computer viruses, break-ins or terrorism.\nOur main operations, including our primary data center, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, could disrupt our operations and therefore harm our business, operating results and financial condition. A natural disaster could also impact our ability to manufacture and deliver our products to customers, or provide support to our customers, any of which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could result in the theft of intellectual property, customer information or other sensitive data. Any of these incidents could result in both legal and reputational costs. Natural disasters, acts of unrest or terrorism or war could also cause disruptions in our or our customers' business, our domestic and international markets, or the economy as a whole. To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the deployment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies, including our own, have been highly volatile. Further, our common stock has a limited trading history. Since our initial public offering in September 2006 through December 31, 2014, our stock price, after adjusting for our 2:1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend effected in November 2010, has fluctuated from a low of $3.55 to a high of $44.70. The market price of our common stock has at times reflected a higher multiple of expected future earnings than many other companies. As a result, even small changes in investor expectations regarding our future growth and earnings, whether as a result of actual or rumored financial or operating results, changes in the mix of products and services sold, acquisitions, industry changes, or other factors, could result in, and have recently resulted in, significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock.\nFactors that could affect the trading price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nproviding estimates of our future operating results, or changes of these estimates, either by us or by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nsignificant sales or purchases, or announcement of significant sales or purchases, of our common stock by us or our stockholders, including our directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nannouncements by or about us regarding events or news adverse to our business;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nactions taken by stockholders and others, including in connection with a potential offer to acquire us;\n\u2022\nan announced acquisition of or by a competitor;\n\u2022\nan announced acquisition of or by us. For example, our stock price declined immediately after the announcement by us of our intention to acquire OPNET; and\n\u2022\nthe failure to consummate the Merger.\nIf the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to announcements by, or events that affect, other companies in our industry, or the trading price might decline in reaction to events that affect the stock market generally even if these announcements or events do not directly affect us. Each of these factors, among others, could cause our stock price to decline. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. If such a lawsuit were filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, it could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will continue to depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If we do not continue to maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOn November 11, 2013, we implemented a stockholder rights plan, also called a poison pill, which may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control of us by, among other things, making it uneconomical for a third-party to acquire us on a hostile basis. In November 2014, we extended the expiration of the rights plan until November 2015.", "PERMNO": 91485, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "RVBD"}
