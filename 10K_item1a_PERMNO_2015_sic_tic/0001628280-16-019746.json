Risk Factors\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our global operations that involve the manufacturing and sale of products for highly demanding customer applications throughout the world. These risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. The following discussion, along with discussions elsewhere in this report, outlines the risks and uncertainties that we believe are the most material to our business at this time. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nEconomic Environment - the demand for our products relies on economic and industrial conditions worldwide.\nChanges in economic or industrial conditions could impact our results or financial condition in any particular period as our business can be sensitive to varying conditions in all major geographies and markets.\nProducts - maintaining a competitive advantage requires continuing investment with uncertain returns.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors who may already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue improving the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to continually invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer service and support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these advantages. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performance and regulatory requirements around the globe. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. Our financial performance may be negatively impacted if a competitor\u2019s successful product innovation reaches the market before ours or gains broader market acceptance. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include wider adoption of technologies providing alternatives to diesel engines.\nCompetition - we participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure.\nThe businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors including price, technology, geographic coverage, product performance, and customer service. Our customers continue to seek productivity gains and lower prices from us and their other suppliers. If we are not able to compete effectively, our margins and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIntellectual Property - demand for our products may be affected by new entrants who copy our products and/or infringe on our intellectual property.\nThe ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. An inability to preserve our intellectual property rights may adversely affect our financial performance.\nCompetitors and others may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe their intellectual property. We may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined our products infringe on their intellectual property. We may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license on terms that are not favorable to us.\nProtecting or defending against such claims could significantly increase our costs, divert management\u2019s time and attention away from other business matters, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal Operations - operating globally carries risks which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe have sales and manufacturing operations throughout the world, with the heaviest concentrations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Our stability, growth, and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business globally that could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\npolitical and military events,\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruption laws, and foreign exchange controls,\n\u2022\ntariffs, trade barriers and other trade restrictions,\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,\n\u2022\ncredit risk of local customers and distributors,\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property, and\n\u2022\nlocal economic, political, and social conditions, including in the Middle East, Ukraine, China, Thailand, and other emerging markets where we do business.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States (U.S.).\nThe enforcement of bribery, corruption and trade laws and regulations is increasing in frequency and complexity on a global basis. The continued geographic expansion of our business increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our compliance programs do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions.\nCustomer Concentration - a number of our customers operate in similar cyclical industries. Economic conditions in these industries could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nNo customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. However, a number of our customers are concentrated in similar cyclical industries (construction, agriculture, and mining), resulting in additional risk based on industrial conditions in those sectors. A decline in the economic conditions of these industries could result in reduced demand for our products and difficulty in collecting amounts due from our customers.\nSupply Chain - unavailable or higher cost materials could impact our financial performance.\nWe obtain raw materials including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products, and other components from third-party suppliers and tend to carry limited raw material inventories. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver on-time and meet the expectations of our customers. An increase in commodity prices could also result in lower operating margins.\nTechnology Investments and Security Risks - difficulties with our information technology systems and security could adversely affect our results.\nWe have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading our existing systems, and preventing information security breaches. There may be other risks as we finalize our multi-year implementation of an enterprise resource planning system (Global ERP Project) on a worldwide basis. Such difficulties could lead to significant additional expenses and/or disruption in business operations that could adversely affect our results.\nAdditionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes, and operations disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation, and could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection matters.\nCurrency - an unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our result of operations.\nWe have operations in many countries, with more than one-half of our annual revenue coming from countries outside of the U.S. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries has a negative impact on our results and financial position. In addition, decreased value of local currency may make it difficult for some of our customers, distributors and end users to purchase our products.\nLegal and Regulatory - costs associated with lawsuits, investigations or complying with laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements. We are involved in various product liability, product warranty, intellectual property, environmental claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. It is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations and lawsuits, and we could incur judgments, fines, or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition in any particular period.\nIncome Tax - changes in our effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\nPersonnel - our success may be affected if we are not able to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to identify, recruit, develop and retain qualified personnel worldwide. If we are unable to meet this challenge, it may be difficult for us to execute our strategic objectives and grow our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity - changes in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing.\nDisruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. During fiscal 2016, credit in the global credit markets was accessible and market interest rates remained low. We believe that our current financial resources, together with cash generated by operations, are sufficient to continue financing our operations for the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions.\nThe majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries as over half of our earnings occur outside the U.S. Most of these funds are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S., as the cash generated from U.S. operations plus our short-term debt facilities are anticipated to be sufficient for our U.S operation\u2019s cash needs. If additional cash is required for our operations in the U.S., it may be subject to additional U.S. taxes if funds are repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries.\nAcquisitions - the execution of our acquisition strategy may not provide the desired return on investment.\nWe have made and continue to pursue acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Industrias Partmo S.A. (Partmo) in August 2016, Engineered Products Company in fiscal 2016 and Northern Technical L.L.C. (Northern Technical) and IFIL USA L.L.C. (IFIL USA) in fiscal 2015. These acquisitions could negatively impact our profitability due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions including the potential loss of key customers, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, the loss of key employees and the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from other business matters.\nImpairment - if our operating units do not meet performance expectations, assets could be subject to impairment.\nOur total assets reflect goodwill and identifiable intangibles from acquisitions. We test annually whether goodwill has been impaired, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the goodwill may be impaired. If future operating performance at one or more of our operating units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of our acquired businesses were to decline, we could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of our goodwill or other intangibles would have an adverse non-cash impact on our results of operations and reduce our net worth.\nRestructuring - if we do not successfully execute our restructuring plans and realize the expected benefits, our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time we have initiated restructuring programs related to our business strategy to, among other things, reduce operating expenses and align manufacturing capacity to demand. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost\nsavings if we do not successfully execute these plans. If difficulties are encountered or such cost savings are otherwise not realized, it could adversely impact our results of operations.\nInternal Controls - if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent material fraud, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting resulted in a material weakness during fiscal 2015.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting resulted in a material weakness during fiscal 2015. Although we completed our remedial actions in response to this matter, there can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies from occurring and which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, or have other potential adverse consequences.", "PERMNO": 61313, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "DCI"}
