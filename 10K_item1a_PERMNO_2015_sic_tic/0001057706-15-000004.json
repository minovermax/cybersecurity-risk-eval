{"cik": "1057706", "company": "FIRST BANCORP /PR/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISKS RELATING TO THE CORPORATION\u2019S BUSINESS\nWe are operating under agreements with our regulators.\nWe are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. We are a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.\nAs a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage in a broader spectrum of \u201cfinancial\u201d activities than those permitted to bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies.At this time, as a result of, among other things, the Regulatory Agreements, under the BHC Act, we currently are not able to engage in new financial activities, and we may not be able to acquire shares or control of other companies. In addition, we are subject to restrictions because of the Regulatory Agreements that our subsidiary FirstBank entered into with the FDIC and we entered into with the Federal Reserve, as further described above.\nOn June 4, 2010, we announced that FirstBank agreed to the FDIC Order issued by the FDIC and OCIF, and we entered into the Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve. These Regulatory Agreements stemmed from the FDIC\u2019s examination as of the period ended June 30, 2009 conducted during the second half of 2009. Although our regulatory capital ratios exceeded the required established minimum capital ratios for a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution as of December 31, 2014 and complied with the capital ratios required by the FDIC Order, FirstBank cannot be regarded as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d as of December 31, 2014 because of the FDIC Order.\nUnder the FDIC Order, FirstBank agreed to address specific areas of concern to the FDIC and OCIF through the adoption and implementation of procedures, plans and policies designed to improve the safety and soundness of FirstBank. These actions include, among others: (1) having and retaining qualified management; (2) increased participation in the affairs of FirstBank by its Board of Directors; (3) development and implementation by FirstBank of a capital plan to attain a leverage ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 12%; (4) adoption and implementation of strategic, liquidity and fund management, and profit and budget plans and related projects within certain timetables set forth in the FDIC Order and on an ongoing basis; (5) adoption and implementation of plans for reducing FirstBank\u2019s positions in certain classified assets and delinquent and non-accrual loans; (6) refraining from lending to delinquent or classified borrowers already obligated to FirstBank on any extensions of credit so long as such credit remains uncollected, except where FirstBank\u2019s failure to extend further credit to a particular borrower would be detrimental to the best interests of FirstBank, and any such additional credit is approved by FirstBank\u2019s Board of Directors, or a designated committee thereof; (7) refraining from accepting, increasing, renewing or rolling over brokered CDs without the prior written approval of the FDIC; (8) establishment of a comprehensive policy and methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses and the review and revision of FirstBank\u2019s loan policies, including the non-accrual policy; and (9) adoption and implementation of adequate and effective programs of independent loan review, appraisal compliance and an effective policy for managing FirstBank\u2019s sensitivity to interest rate risk.\nThe Written Agreement, which is designed to enhance our ability to act as a source of strength to FirstBank, requires that we obtain prior Federal Reserve approval before declaring or paying dividends, receiving dividends from FirstBank, making payments on subordinated debt or trust-preferred securities, incurring, increasing or guaranteeing debt (whether such debt is incurred, increased or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by us or any of our non-banking subsidiaries) or purchasing or redeeming any capital stock. The Written Agreement also required us to submit to the Federal Reserve a capital plan and requires that we submit progress reports, comply with certain notice provisions prior to appointing new directors or senior executive officers and comply with certain payment restrictions on severance payments and indemnification restrictions.\nWe anticipate that we will need to continue to dedicate significant resources to our efforts to comply with the Regulatory Agreements, which may increase operational costs or adversely affect the amount of time our management has to conduct our operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the Regulatory Agreements in the future, we may become subject to additional regulatory enforcement action up to and including the appointment of a conservator or receiver for FirstBank.\nOur high level of non-performing loans may adversely affect our future results from operations.\nOur level of non-performing loans increased $28.2 million to $578.5 million, or 5% during 2014, which represents approximately 6% of our $9.3 billion loan portfolio. Total non-performing assets decreased $8.6 million to $716.8 million, or 1% during 2014. If we are unable to effectively maintain the quality of our loan portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain funding sources may not be available to us and our funding sources may prove insufficient and/or costly to replace.\nFirstBank relies primarily on customer deposits, the issuance of brokered CDs, and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank to maintain its lending activities and to replace certain maturing liabilities. As of December 31, 2014, we had $3.2 billion in brokered deposits (including CDs and money market accounts) outstanding, representing approximately 34% of our total deposits, and a reduction of $254.1 million from December 31, 2013. Approximately $1.8 billion in brokered CDs mature over the next twelve months, and the average term to maturity of the retail brokered CDs outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was approximately 1.0 years. None of these CDs are callable at the Corporation\u2019s option.\nAlthough FirstBank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, we may not be able to replace these funds in the future if our financial condition or general market conditions were to change or the FDIC did not approve our request to issue brokered deposits, as required by the FDIC Order. The FDIC Order requires FirstBank to obtain FDIC approval prior to issuing, increasing, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits and to maintain the plan to reduce its reliance on brokered deposits. Although the FDIC has issued temporary approvals permitting FirstBank to renew and/or roll over certain amounts of brokered CDs maturing in the past and we have received approval from the FDIC to issue brokered deposits through March 31, 2015, the FDIC may not continue to issue such approvals, even if the requests are consistent with our plans to reduce reliance on brokered deposits, and, even if issued, such approvals may not be for amounts of brokered deposits sufficient for FirstBank to meet its funding needs. The use of brokered deposits has been particularly important for the funding of our operations. If we are unable to issue brokered deposits, or are unable to maintain access to our other funding sources, our results of operations and liquidity would be adversely affected.\nAlternate sources of funding may carry higher costs than sources currently utilized. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources, profitability would be adversely affected. We may determine to seek debt financing in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Any future debt financing requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve may not approve such financing. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on acceptable terms. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and our credit capacity. In addition, the Bank may seek to sell loans as an additional source of liquidity. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on acceptable terms, our profitability and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on cash dividends from FirstBank to meet our cash obligations.\nAs a holding company, dividends from FirstBank provided a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust-preferred securities and other obligations. As outlined in the Written Agreement, we cannot receive any cash dividends from FirstBank without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. In addition, FirstBank is limited by law in its ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on its earnings and capital position. Our inability to receive approval from the Federal Reserve to receive dividends from FirstBank, or FirstBank\u2019s failure to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us, may adversely affect our ability to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business and may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition.\nThe Banking Act of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico requires that a minimum of 10% of FirstBank\u2019s net income for the year be transferred to legal surplus until such surplus equals the total of paid-in-capital on common and preferred stock. Amounts transferred to the legal surplus account from the retained earnings account are not available for distribution to the Corporation without the prior consent of the OCIF.\nIf we do not obtain Federal Reserve approval to pay interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust-preferred securities, a default under certain obligations may occur.\nThe Written Agreement provides that we cannot declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust-preferred securities without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. With respect to our $232 million of outstanding subordinated debentures, we have elected to defer the interest payments that were due in quarterly periods since March 2012. The aggregate amount of payments deferred and accrued approximates $21.9 million as of December 31, 2014.\nUnder the indentures, we have the right, from time to time, and without causing an event of default, to defer payments of interest on the subordinated debentures by extending the interest payment period at any time and from time to time during the term of the subordinated debentures for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods. We may continue to elect extension periods for future quarterly interest payments if the Federal Reserve advises us that it will not approve such future quarterly interest payments. Our\ninability to receive approval from the Federal Reserve to make distributions of interest, principal or other sums on our trust-preferred securities and subordinated debentures could result in a default under those obligations if we need to defer such payments for longer than twenty consecutive quarterly periods.\nCredit quality may result in additional losses.\nThe quality of our credits has continued to be under pressure as a result of continued recessionary conditions in the markets we serve that have led to, among other things, high unemployment levels, low absorption rates for new residential construction projects and further declines in property values. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments. When the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases or the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, our business, financial condition, allowance levels, asset impairments, liquidity, capital and results of operations are adversely affected.\nWe have a commercial and construction loan portfolio held for investment in the amount of $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Due to their nature, these loans entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. Furthermore, given the slowdown in the real estate market, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of if they are foreclosed. As of December 31, 2014, we had $300.4 million in nonperforming commercial and construction loans held for investment. We may incur additional credit losses over the near term, either because of continued deterioration of the quality of the loans or because of sales of such loans, which would likely accelerate the recognition of losses. Any such losses would adversely impact our overall financial performance and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate and purchase. We establish a provision for loan and lease losses, which leads to reductions in our income from operations, in order to maintain our allowance for inherent loan and lease losses at a level that our management deems to be appropriate based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio. Management may fail to accurately estimate the level of inherent loan and lease losses or may have to increase our provision for loan and lease losses in the future as a result of new information regarding existing loans, future increases in non-performing loans, changes in economic and other conditions affecting borrowers or for other reasons beyond our control. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of additional classified loans and loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management.\nThe level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s estimates based upon various assumptions and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio and our expense relating to the additional provision for credit losses could increase substantially.\nAny such increases in our provision for loan and lease losses or any loan losses in excess of our provision for loan and lease losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. Given the difficulties facing some of our largest borrowers, these borrowers may fail to continue to repay their loans on a timely basis or we may not be able to assess accurately any risk of loss from the loans to these borrowers. Also, additional economic weakness, which has resulted in downgrades of Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation debt to non-investment grade, among other consequences, could require increases in reserves.\nChanges in collateral values of properties located in stagnant or distressed economies may require increased reserves.\nFurther deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction, commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 2%, 18% and 32% of our loan portfolio consisted of construction, commercial mortgage and residential real estate loans, respectively.\nA substantial part of our loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is located in Puerto Rico, the USVI, the BVI, or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. Puerto Rico has been in an economic recession since 2006. Sustained weak economic conditions that have affected Puerto Rico and the United States over the last several years have resulted in declines in collateral values.\nConstruction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December 31, 2014, commercial mortgage and construction real estate loans amounted to $1.8 billion or 20% of the total loan portfolio.\nWe measure the impairment of a loan based on the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, which is generally obtained from appraisals. Updated appraisals are obtained when we determine that loans are impaired and are updated annually thereafter. In addition, appraisals are also obtained for certain residential mortgage loans on a spot basis based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels, age of the appraisal and loan-to-value ratios. The appraised value of the collateral may decrease or we may not be able to recover collateral at its appraised value. A significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans may require increases in our specific provision for loan losses and an increase in the general valuation allowance. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net charge-offs specifically related to values of properties collateralizing construction, commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loan portfolios totaled $5.5 million, $15.2 million and $23.3 million, respectively.\nThe recent acquisition of certain assets and deposits of Doral Bank through an alliance with another financial institution could magnify certain of the risks the Corporation already faces and could present new risks.\nOn February 27, 2015, the Corporation through an alliance with another local financial institution who was the successful lead bidder with the FDIC on the failed Doral Bank, acquired certain assets and deposits of Doral Bank. The transaction could magnify certain of the risks the Corporation already faces that are described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and could present new risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 risks associated with weak economic conditions in the economy and in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, which adversely affect real estate prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits, which may affect, among other things, the continued status of the loans acquired as performing loans, charge-offs and provision expense;\n\u00b7 risks associated with maintaining customer relationships, including managing any potential customer confusion caused by the alliance structure;\n\u00b7 risks associated with the limited amount of diligence able to be conducted by a buyer in an FDIC-assisted transaction;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates and market liquidity which may reduce interest margins;\n\u00b7 changes in market rates and prices that may adversely impact the value of financial assets and liabilities;\n\u00b7 difficulties in converting or integrating Doral Bank branches or any difficulties of the alliance co-bidder in providing transition support;\n\u00b7 transaction expenses; and\n\u00b7 failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the time frames expected.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income.\nShifts in short-term interest rates may reduce net interest income, which is the principal component of our earnings. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. Differences in the re-pricing structure of our assets and liabilities may result in changes in our profits when interest rates change.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce the value of holdings of securities.\nFixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise, which may require recognition of a loss (e.g., the identification of an other-than-temporary impairment on our available-for-sale investment portfolio), thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. Market-related reductions in value also influence our ability to finance these securities. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may result in an extension of the expected average life of certain fixed-income securities, such as fixed-rate passthrough mortgage-backed securities. Such an extension could exacerbate the drop in market value related to shifts in interest rates.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce demand for mortgage and other loans.\nHigher interest rates increase the cost of mortgage and other loans to consumers and businesses and may reduce demand for such loans, which may negatively impact our profits by reducing the amount of loan interest income.\nAccelerated prepayments may adversely affect net interest income.\nIn general, fixed-income portfolio yields would decrease if the re-investment of pre-payment amounts is at lower rates. Net interest income could also be affected by prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Acceleration in the prepayments of mortgage-backed securities would lower yields on these securities, as the amortization of premiums paid upon the acquisition of these securities would accelerate. Conversely, acceleration in the prepayments of mortgage-backed securities would increase yields on securities purchased at a discount, as the accretion of the discount would accelerate. These risks are directly linked to future period market interest rate fluctuations. Also, net interest income in future periods might be affected by our investment in callable securities because decreases in interest rates might prompt the early redemption of such securities.\nChanges in interest rates on loans and borrowings may adversely affect net interest income.\nBasis risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the difference, also referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or basis, between the rates for two or more different instruments with the same maturity and occurs when market rates for different financial instruments or the indices used to price assets and liabilities change at different times or by different amounts. For example, the interest expense for liability instruments such as brokered CDs might not change by the same amount as interest income received from loans or investments. To the extent that the interest rates on loans and borrowings change at different speeds and by different amounts, the margin between our LIBOR-based assets and the higher cost of the brokered CDs might be compressed and adversely affect net interest income.\nIf all or a significant portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheet is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings and our capital ratios would be adversely affected.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, we recognized a total of $2.0 million, $0.2 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairments. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio of $42.5 million as of December 31, 2014 is determined to be other-than-temporary and, in the case of debt securities, the loss is related to credit factors, we would recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made and capital ratios could be adversely affected. Even if we do not determine that the unrealized losses associated with this portfolio require an impairment charge, increases in these unrealized losses adversely affect our tangible common equity ratio, which may adversely affect credit rating agency and investor sentiment towards us. Any negative perception also may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets or might increase our cost of capital. Valuation and other-than-temporary impairment determinations will continue to be affected by external market factors including default rates, severity rates and macro-economic factors.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could further increase the cost of borrowing funds.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to access new non-deposit sources of funding could be adversely affected by downgrades in our credit ratings. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity is to a certain extent contingent upon its ability to obtain external sources of funding to finance its operations. The Corporation\u2019s current credit ratings and any downgrades in such credit ratings can hinder the Corporation\u2019s access to new forms of external funding and/or cause external funding to be more expensive, which could in turn adversely affect results of operations. Also, changes in credit ratings may further affect the fair value of unsecured derivatives that consider the Corporation\u2019s own credit risk as part of the valuation.\nDefective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding First BanCorp. on the loans sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and relate to, among other things:\n\u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 underwriting standards;\n\u00b7 the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file; and\n\u00b7 the characteristics and enforceability of the loan\nA loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and may not be saleable or may be saleable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market\u2019s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risk could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nWe may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest-rate risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted and periodically improved various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. Any improvements to our controls, procedures, policies and systems, however, may not be adequate to identify and manage the risks in our various businesses. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets or our businesses or for other reasons, we could incur losses or suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory mandates or expectations.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. In addition, our customers, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect us, or the customers, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. When we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any reserves we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the periods in which we recognize the losses.\nCyber-attacks, system risks and data protection breaches could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs.\nFirst BanCorp. is under continuous threat of cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer services via the internet and other remote service channels. Three of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud, denial-of-service and computer intrusion that might result in loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds from customer bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to the Corporation if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and our plans to continue to provide electronic banking services to our customers.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of our customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nWe rely on other companies to perform key aspects of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties perform key aspects of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an inherent risk to our business operations.\nHurricanes and other weather-related events could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our operations is located in a region susceptible to hurricanes. Such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. We maintain hurricane insurance, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption to the markets that we serve that a catastrophic hurricane could produce. Further, a hurricane in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. The severity and impact of future hurricanes and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of future hurricanes and other weather-related events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompetition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of uncertainty concerning compensation restrictions applicable to banks but not applicable to other financial services firms. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could adversely affect our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our markets and years of industry experience and, in some cases, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Similarly, the loss of key employees, either individually or as a group, could result in a loss of customer confidence in our ability to execute banking transactions on their behalf.\nFurther increases in the FDIC deposit insurance premium or in FDIC required reserves may have a significant financial impact on us.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions up to certain limits. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d). Economic conditions since 2008 have resulted in higher bank failures. In the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the DIF. The FDIC is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the DIF, and the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the DIF\u2019s reserves against future losses, which will require institutions with assets greater than $10 billion to bear an increased responsibility for funding the prescribed reserve to support the DIF. Since then, the FDIC addressed plans to bolster the DIF by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to 1.35 percent (ratio of reserves to insured deposits) by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC has also adopted a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to 2 percent, 65 basis points above the statutory minimum, but the FDIC does not project that goal to be met for several years.\nThe FDIC\u2019s revised rule on deposit insurance assessments implements a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on domestic deposits to one based on average consolidated total assets minus average Tier 1 capital. The rule changes the assessment rate schedules for insured depository institutions so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected under the new assessment base as would be collected under the previous rate schedule and the schedules previously proposed by the FDIC. The rule also revises the risk-based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions (generally, institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets, such as FirstBank). Under the rule, the FDIC uses a scorecard method to calculate assessment rates for all such institutions.\nThe FDIC may further increase FirstBank\u2019s premiums or impose additional assessments or prepayment requirements in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act has removed the statutory cap for the reserve ratio, leaving the FDIC free to set this cap going forward.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected by litigation.\nFrom time to time, our customers, or the government on their behalf, may make claims and take legal action relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities. We may also face employment lawsuits or other legal claims. In any such claims or actions, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us resulting in financial liability or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors or on customer demand for our products and services. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies. As a result, any reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe resolution of legal actions or regulatory matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the quarter in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established.\nOur businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.\nOur relationships with many of our customers are predicated upon our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions, like the Regulatory Agreements, litigation, operational failures, the failure to meet customer expectations and other issues with respect to one or more of our businesses could materially and adversely affect our reputation, or our ability to attract and retain customers or obtain sources of funding for the same or other businesses. Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses, the market places in which we operate, the regulatory environment and customer expectations. If any of these developments has a material adverse effect on our reputation, our business will suffer.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to promulgate new requirements that further interpret or seek to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments, structures or transactions as well as to revise standards to expand disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in footnotes to our financial statements, which are incorporated herein by reference. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, the effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. We conducted our 2014 evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe Step 1 evaluation of goodwill allocated to the Florida reporting unit under both valuation approaches (market and discounted cash flow analysis) indicated that the fair value of the unit was above the carrying amount of its equity book value as of the valuation date (October 1), which meant that Step 2 was not undertaken. Goodwill with a carrying value of $28.1 million was not impaired as of December 31, 2014 or 2013, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during 2014, 2013, and 2012. If we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by the Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had a deferred tax asset of $313.0 million (net of a valuation allowance of $204.6 million), including $188.4 million associated with NOLs. Under Puerto Rico law, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including FirstBank, which incurred most of the NOLs, are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. To obtain the full benefit of the applicable deferred tax asset attributable to NOLs, FirstBank must have sufficient taxable income within the applicable carry forward period (7 years for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005, 12 years for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004 and before December 31, 2012, and 10 years for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012). The Bank incurred all of its NOLs on or after 2009. Accounting for income taxes requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax asset based on an assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Corporation concluded that, as of December, 31, 2014, it is more likely than not that FirstBank will generate sufficient taxable income within the applicable NOL carry-forward periods to realize a significant portion of its deferred tax assets and recorded a partial reversal of its valuation allowance in the amount of $302.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of the partial reversal, the Corporation\u2019s valuation allowance decreased to $204.6 million, as of December 31, 2014, from $522.7 million as of December 31, 2013. Due to significant estimates utilized in determining the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that, in the future, the Corporation will not be able to reverse the remaining valuation allowance or that the Corporation will need to increase its current deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nThe Corporation\u2019s judgments regarding accounting policies and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flow.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Corporation provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable GAAP.\nFluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. In addition, tax positions may be challenged by the IRS and the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and we may estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under applicable GAAP. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate and could result in a material increase in our tax expense. Resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. Tax year 2012 is currently under examination by the IRS. If any issues addressed in this examination are resolved in a manner not consistent with the Corporation\u2019s expectations, the Corporation could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period in which such resolution occurs.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY\nDifficult market conditions have affected the financial industry and may adversely affect us in the future.\nGiven that most of our business is in Puerto Rico and the United States and given the degree of interrelation between Puerto Rico\u2019s economy and that of the United States, we are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy, including factors such as unemployment and underemployment levels in the United States and real estate valuations. The deterioration of these conditions could adversely affect the credit performance of mortgage loans, credit default swaps and other derivatives, and result in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks.\nDespite improving labor markets in the U.S. in the past year, an elevated amount of underemployment and household debt, the prolonged low interest rate environment, along with a continued sluggish recovery in the consumer real estate market and certain commercial real estate market in the U.S., pose challenges for the U.S. economic performance and the financial services industry.\nIn particular, we may face the following risks:\n\u2022\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite the loans become less predictive of future behaviors.\n\u2022\nThe models used to estimate losses inherent in the credit exposure require difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the models.\n\u2022\nOur ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties (including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government-sponsored entities and repurchase agreements) on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including deteriorating investor expectations.\n\u2022\nCompetitive dynamics in the industry could change as a result of consolidation of financial services companies in connection with adverse changes in market conditions.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to continue to comply with the Regulatory Agreements, which could result in further regulatory enforcement actions.\n\u2022\nWe expect to continue to face increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u2022\nThere may be downward pressure on our stock price.\nThe deterioration of economic conditions in the U.S. and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access capital and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nContinuation of the economic slowdown and decline in the real estate market in Puerto Rico could continue to harm our results of operations.\nThe residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and industry-wide losses. The market for residential mortgage loan originations has declined over the past few years and this trend may continue to reduce the level of mortgage loans we produce in the future and adversely affect our business. During periods of rising interest rates, the refinancing of many mortgage products tends to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values.\nThe actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on loans have been higher during the economic slowdown. Rising unemployment, lower interest rates and declines in housing prices have had a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay their mortgage loans. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could continue to harm our ability to sell loans, the prices we receive for loans, the values of mortgage loans held for sale or residual interests in securitizations, which could continue to harm our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any additional material decline in real estate values would further weaken the collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, we will be subject to the risk of loss on such real estate arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third-party credit enhancement.\nThe Corporation\u2019s credit quality may be adversely affected by Puerto Rico\u2019s current economic condition.\nA significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which has endured a prolonged period of economic and fiscal challenges. Based on the first six months of fiscal year 2013-2014, the main economic indicators suggest that the Puerto Rico economy remains weak. According to the Puerto Rico Planning Board, the Commonwealth\u2019s gross national product (\u201cGNP\u201d) contracted (in real terms) from 2006 through 2011, reflecting its first period of slight economic growth in 2012 and 2013 when GNP grew 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2014 and 2015, the Puerto Rico Planning Board projects a slight economic growth in real GNP of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. This continued period of economic stagnation may have an adverse effect on employment and could have an adverse effect on Commonwealth tax revenues.\nThe Government has implemented a multi-year budget plan for reducing the deficit. Some of the measures implemented by the government include increasing corporate taxes and reforming the employee retirement systems of the Commonwealth. Since the government is an important source of employment in Puerto Rico, these measures had a temporary adverse effect on the island\u2019s\nalready weak economy. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Puerto Rico decreased to 13.7% in December 2014, compared to 15.45% in December 2013. The seasonally adjusted payroll non-farm employment decreased by 0.9% in December 2014, compared to December 2013. On July 1, 2014, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed a balanced budget for fiscal year 2015, the first balanced budget in more than a decade.\nThe economy of Puerto Rico is highly sensitive to global oil prices since the island does not have a significant mass transit system available to the public and most of its electricity is powered by oil, making it highly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices. A substantial increase in the price of oil could adversely impact the economy by reducing disposable income and increasing the operating costs for most businesses and government operations. Consumer spending is particularly sensitive to wide fluctuations in oil prices. Several bills have been filed at the Legislative Assembly that address energy costs in Puerto Rico. One bill supported by the Governor proposes to transform the Telecommunications Regulatory Board into the Energy and Telecommunications Commission, which will be responsible for all energy and telecommunications regulatory matters. This new entity would also be responsible for all tariff-related issues. Another bill approved by the Senate proposes the creation of a regulatory agency that will approve or reject energy rates for all energy producers in Puerto Rico and would be responsible for opening Puerto Rico\u2019s energy market to competition. Both proposals are intended to substantially reduce Puerto Rico\u2019s energy costs.\nThe decline in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy since 2006 has resulted, among other things, in a decline in our loan originations, an increase in the level of our non-performing assets, loan loss provisions and charge-offs, particularly in our construction and commercial loan portfolios, an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans, and a reduction in the value of our loan portfolio, all of which have adversely affected our profitability. Any further potential deterioration of economic activity could result in further adverse effects on our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had $339.0 million in credit facilities granted to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities and public corporations, of which $308.0 million was outstanding, compared to $397.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2013. Approximately $201.4 million of the outstanding credit facilities consists of loans to municipalities in Puerto Rico. Municipal debt exposure is secured by ad valorem taxation without limitation as to rate or amount on all taxable property within the boundaries of each municipality. The good faith, credit, and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to the repayment of all outstanding bonds and notes. Approximately $13.2 million consists of loans to units of the central government, and approximately $93.4 million consists of loans to public corporations. Furthermore, the Corporation had $133.3 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014 in financing to the hotel industry in Puerto Rico guaranteed by the TDF, compared to $200.4 million as of December 31, 2013.\nOn June 28, 2014, the governor of Puerto Rico signed into law The Recovery Act to provide a legislative framework for certain public corporations that are experiencing severe financial stress to address their financial obstacles through an orderly, statutory process that allows them to handle their debts, while ensuring the continuity of essential services to citizens and infrastructure upgrades.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had an exposure to public corporations covered by the Recovery Act amounting to $93.4 million, including the $75 million direct exposure to PREPA. In August 2014, PREPA entered into a forbearance agreement with a group of banks, including FirstBank, to extend further its maturing credit lines to March 31, 2015. As a result of the forbearance, the credit was classified as a TDR loan during the third quarter of 2014. The loan has been maintained in accrual status based on the estimated cash flow analyses performed on this non-collateral dependent loan and repayment prospects.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had outstanding $61.2 million in obligations of the Puerto Rico government, mainly bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Building Authority, as part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, carried on its books at a fair value of $43.2 million.\nOn February 4, 2014, S&P downgraded the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt to BB+, one level below investment grade. S&P also downgraded to levels below investment grade the credit rating of the GDB and other government entities. On February 7, 2014, Moody\u2019s downgraded the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico general obligation bonds to Ba2, two notches below investment grade. Moody\u2019s also downgraded to Ba2 the Public Building Authority Bonds, the Pension Funding Bonds, the GDB senior notes, the Municipal Finance Authority Bonds, the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Finance Authority Special Tax Revenue Bonds, the Convention Center District Authority Hotel Occupancy Tax Revenue Bonds, the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority Transportation Revenue Bonds, various ratings of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. In addition, the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation\u2019s senior-lien bonds were downgraded by Moody\u2019s to Baa1 from A2, retaining investment grade status. Following the downgrades by S&P and Moody\u2019s, Fitch became the third agency to downgrade the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico debt to BB, two notches below investment grade. On March 11, 2014, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico sold $3.5 billion in general obligation bonds at a yield of 8.72% to refinance short-term liabilities and to address liquidity needs.\nIn July 2014, the Puerto Rico debt and the debt of certain public corporations were downgraded further into speculative grade by these credit agencies after the enactment of The Recovery Act. In February 2015, a federal judge ruled that the Recovery Act is pre-empted by the Federal Bankruptcy Court and therefore void. After this decision, S&P and Moody\u2019s downgraded Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation debt deeper into non-investment grade category. S&P now rates Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation bonds at B, five notches below investment grade, Moody\u2019s at Caa1, seven notches below investment grade, and Fitch at BB-, three notches below investment grade. The issuers of Puerto Rico government and agencies bonds held by the Corporation have not defaulted, and the contractual payments on these securities have been made as scheduled.\nIt is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential further rating downgrades of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt obligation. However, further deterioration in the fiscal situation, could adversely affect the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government and agencies securities.\nIn February 2015, the Governor of Puerto Rico announced a proposal for a new tax code that would replace the current 7% sales and use tax with a 16% value-added tax, while lowering income taxes. While legislation for the new tax code has been introduced, it is too early to determine what changes will be made during the legislative process and what effect this proposal, if enacted into law, will have on economic activity.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had $227.4 million of Puerto Rico public sector deposits ($208.1 million in transactional accounts and $19.3 million in time deposits) compared to $546.5 million as of December 31, 2013. Approximately 54% is from municipalities in Puerto Rico and 46% is from public corporations and the central government and agencies.\nIn 2014, Act 24-2014 was approved by the Puerto Rico Legislature, seeking to further strengthen the liquidity of the GDB and the GDB\u2019s oversight of public funds.\nAmong other measures, Act 24-2014 grants the GDB the ability to exercise additional oversight of certain public funds deposited at private financial institutions and grants the GDB the legal authority, subject to an entity\u2019s ability to request waivers under certain specified circumstances, to require such public funds (other than funds of the Legislative Branch, the Judicial Branch, the University of Puerto Rico, governmental pension plans, municipalities and certain other independent agencies) to be deposited at the GDB, which is expected to maximize liquidity and to result in a more efficient management of public resources. As anticipated, certain public corporations and agencies withdrew from FirstBank approximately $341.6 million during the second quarter of 2014. The Corporation will continue to focus on transactional accounts and to seek to obtain deposits from entities excluded from Act 24-2014.\nThe failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by future failures of financial institutions and the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, investment companies and other institutional clients. In certain of these transactions, we are required to post collateral to secure the obligations to the counterparties. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties, we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral, or we may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty, such as the loss of our assets that we pledged to Lehman Brothers, Inc., which we have been trying to recover, so far unsuccessfully.\nIn addition, many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client. In addition, the credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Any losses resulting from our routine funding transactions may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe financial crisis resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. government intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding by temporarily enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances and increasing insurance on bank deposits.\nThese programs have subjected financial institutions, particularly those participating in TARP, to additional restrictions, oversight and costs. In addition, new proposals for legislation are periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.\nIn recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations. If these regulatory trends continue, they could adversely affect our business and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations.\nThe Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to Puerto Rico income tax laws on their income from all sources. As Puerto Rico corporations, First BanCorp. and its subsidiaries are treated as foreign corporations for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and are generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on their income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those regions. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance.\nIn February 2015, the Governor of Puerto Rico announced a proposal for a new tax code that would, among other things, replace the current 7% sales and use tax with a 16% value-added tax, while lowering income taxes. While legislation for the new tax code has been introduced, it is too early to determine what changes will be made during the legislative process. Legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nFinancial services legislation and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations and on our credit ratings.\nThe Corporation faces increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny as a result of, among other things, its participation in the TARP. The U.S. Treasury acquired shares of Common Stock from the Corporation in October 2011 in exchange for shares of preferred stock that it owned because of the Corporation\u2019s issuance of preferred stock to Treasury in January 2009 pursuant to the TARP. In July 2010, the Corporation issued to Treasury a warrant, which amends, restates and replaces the original warrant that it issued to Treasury in January 2009 under the TARP. The Corporation\u2019s participation in the TARP also imposes limitations on the payments it may make to its senior leaders.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, and the regulations developed and to be developed thereunder include or will include, provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike.\nThe Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements that will apply to both insured banks and their holding companies. Regulations implementing the Collins Amendment set as a floor for the capital requirements of the Corporation and FirstBank a minimum capital requirement computed using the FDIC\u2019s general risk-based capital rules.\nAs previously discussed, the federal banking agencies have adopted final rules for U.S. banks that revise in important respects the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the components of regulatory capital, and the risk-based capital treatment of bank assets and off-balance sheet exposures. The final rules, which became effective for the Corporation and FirstBank beginning January 1, 2015, generally are intended to align U.S. regulatory capital requirements with Basel III international regulatory capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010 (and revised in 2011) known as \u201cBasel III.\u201d The new rules increase the quantity and quality of required capital by, among other things, establishing a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets and an additional common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. In addition, banks and bank holding companies are required to have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0% and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0%. The final rules also revise the definition of capital by expanding the conditions for the inclusion of equity capital instruments and minority interests as Tier 1 capital, and impose limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if additional specified amounts, or \u201cbuffers,\u201d of common equity Tier 1 capital are not met.\nConsistent with Basel III and the Collins Amendment, the final rules also establish a more conservative standard for including an instrument such as trust-preferred securities as Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $15 billion or more as of December 31, 2009, setting out a phase-out schedule. Bank holding companies such as the Corporation must fully phase out these instruments from Tier I capital by January 1, 2016, although qualifying trust preferred securities may be included as Tier 2 capital until the instruments are redeemed or mature. As of December 31, 2014, the Corporation had $225 million in trust preferred securities that are subject to the phase-out from Tier 1 capital under the final regulatory capital rules discussed above.\nIn addition, the final rules revise and harmonize the bank regulators\u2019 rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses that have been identified recently, by applying a variation of the Basel III \u201cstandardized approach\u201d for the risk-weighting of bank assets and off-balance sheet exposures to all U.S. banking organizations other than large, internationally active banks.\nThe final capital rules became effective for the Corporation and our subsidiary bank on a multi-year transitional basis starting on January 1, 2015, and in general will be fully effective as of January 1, 2019. First BanCorp. and FirstBank were able to meet well-capitalized capital ratios upon implementation of the requirements. Although we expect to continue to exceed the minimum requirements for well capitalized status under the new capital rules, there can be no assurance that we will remain well capitalized. Moreover, for as long as we and FirstBank are subject to the provisions of the Regulatory Agreements, we cannot be considered to be well-capitalized.\nAdditional regulatory proposals and legislation, if finally adopted, would change banking laws and our operating environment and that of our subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The ultimate effect that such legislation, if enacted, or regulations would have upon our financial condition or results of operations may be adverse.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB will result in higher regulatory and compliance costs related to originating and servicing residential mortgage loans and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of single-family residential mortgage lending in the United States. Among other things, the law transferred rule-making and enforcement powers from a number of federal agencies to the CFPB, imposed new risk retention and recordkeeping requirements on lenders (such as the Bank) that sell single-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, required revision of disclosure documents, limited loan originator compensation and expanded recordkeeping and reporting requirements under other federal statutes.\nNew regulations implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d). See \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\u201d\nAmong other consequences of these numerous changes, the new ability to repay requirements may result in reduced credit availability and higher borrowing costs to cover the costs of compliance. The ability of borrowers to raise new defenses in foreclosure proceedings on defaulted mortgage loans also may lead to increased foreclosure costs, extend foreclosure timeliness, and increase the severity of loan losses. Increased repurchase and indemnity requests with respect to mortgage loans sold into the secondary markets may also result.\nSome of these new rules became effective in June 2013, while others became effective in January 2014. These and other changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act will require substantial modifications to the entire mortgage lending and servicing industry. Their impact may involve changes to our operations and increased compliance costs in making single-family residential mortgage loans. Additional rulemaking affecting the residential mortgage business may occur, which may cause us to incur additional increased regulatory and compliance costs.\nCompliance with stress testing requirements may be challenging.\nThe Corporation is currently subject to supervisory guidance for stress testing practices issued by the federal banking agencies in May 2012. This guidance outlines broad principles for a satisfactory stress testing framework and describes various stress testing approaches and how stress testing should be used at various levels within an organization. As previously discussed, the Corporation is also subject to two new stress testing rules that implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, one issued by the Federal Reserve Board that applies to First BanCorp. on a consolidated basis and one issued by the FDIC that applies to the Bank.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests, the Corporation\u2019s first annual company-run stress testing should be submitted to regulators no later than March 31, 2015. Public disclosure of the results for the severely adverse economic scenario is expected to be made during the second quarter of 2015 on the Corporation\u2019s website. Such public disclosure of stress test results could result in reputational harm if the Corporation\u2019s results are worse than those of its competitors or otherwise indicate that the Corporation\u2019s risk profile is excessive or elevated. Furthermore, given that the Corporation will be subject to multiple stress testing requirements that are administered at different levels by more than one federal banking agency, and compliance with such requirements will be complicated, if the Corporation fails to fully comply with these requirements, it may be subject to regulatory action.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action related to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with trade and economic sanctions requirements and rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE CORPORATION\u2019S COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK\nSales in the public market under an outstanding resale registration statement filed with the SEC by the small group of large stockholders that hold in the aggregate approximately 44.7% of our outstanding shares could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe following stockholders own an aggregate of approximately 44.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock: funds affiliated with Thomas H. Lee Partners L.P. (\u201cTHL\u201d), which own approximately 19.7%; funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cOaktree\u201d), which own approximately 19.7%; and U.S. Treasury which owns approximately 5.4%, including the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant. We are obligated to keep the prospectus, which is part of the resale registration statement, current so that the securities can be sold in the public market at any time. The resale of the securities in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIssuance of additional equity securities in the public market and other capital management or business strategies that we may pursue also may depress the market price of our common stock and could result in dilution of holders of our common stock and preferred stock.\nGenerally, we are not restricted from issuing additional equity securities, including common stock. We may choose or be required in the future to identify, consider and pursue additional capital management strategies to bolster our capital position. We may issue equity securities (including convertible securities, preferred securities, and options and warrants on our common or preferred stock securities) in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, adjust our leverage ratio, address regulatory capital concerns, restructure currently outstanding debt or equity securities or satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants. Future issuances of our equity securities, including common stock, in any transaction that we may pursue may dilute the interests of our existing holders of our common stock and preferred stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe Corporation has outstanding a warrant held by the Treasury to purchase 1,285,899 shares of common stock. If the warrant is exercised, the issuance of shares of Common Stock would reduce our income per share, and further reduce the book value per share and voting power of our current common stockholders.\nAdditionally, THL and Oaktree have anti-dilution rights, which they acquired when they purchased shares of common stock in the $525 million capital raise, completed in October 2011 that have been, and will be in the future, triggered, subject to certain exceptions, upon our issuance of additional shares of common stock. In such a case, THL and Oaktree had, and will have, the right to acquire the amount of shares of common stock that will enable them to maintain their percentage ownership interest in the Corporation.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe stock markets have experienced high levels of volatility since 2008. These market fluctuations have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and volatility because of factors specifically related to our businesses and may continue to fluctuate or decline.\nFactors that could cause fluctuations, volatility or a decline in the market price of our common stock, many of which could be beyond our control, include the following:\n\u2022\nuncertainties and developments related to the resolution of the Puerto Rico Government fiscal problems;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to comply with the Regulatory Agreements;\n\u2022\nany additional regulatory actions against us;\n\u2022\nchanges or perceived changes in the condition, operations, results or prospects of our businesses and market assessments of these changes or perceived changes;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, including any failures of banks;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or proposals, or new governmental regulations or proposals, affecting us;\n\u2022\na continuing recession in the Puerto Rico market and a lack of growth in our other principal markets in the Virgin Islands and the United States;\n\u2022\nthe departure of key employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us; and\n\u2022\nthe public perception of the banking industry and its safety and soundness.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NYSE and the market for commercial banks and other financial services companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur suspension of dividends may have adversely affected and may further adversely affect our stock price and could result in the expansion of our Board of Directors.\nIn March 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a supervisory guidance letter intended to provide direction to bank holding companies (\u201cBHCs\u201d) on the declaration and payment of dividends, capital redemptions and capital repurchases by BHCs in the context of their capital planning process. The letter reiterates the long-standing Federal Reserve Board supervisory policies and guidance to the effect that BHCs should only pay dividends from current earnings. More specifically, the letter heightens expectations that BHCs will inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff on the declaration and payment of dividends that exceed earnings for the period for which a dividend is being paid. In consideration of the financial results reported for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, we decided, as a matter of prudent fiscal management and following the Federal Reserve Board guidance, to suspend the payment of dividends. Furthermore, our Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Board precludes us from declaring any dividends without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. We cannot anticipate if and when the payment of dividends might be reinstated.\nThis suspension may have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our stock price. Further, because dividends on our Series A through E Preferred Stock have not been paid since we suspended dividend payments in August 2009, the holders of the preferred stock have the right to appoint two additional members to our Board of Directors. Any member of the Board of Directors appointed by the holders of Series A through E Preferred Stock is required to vacate his or her office if the Corporation resumes the payment of dividends in full for twelve consecutive monthly dividend periods.", "PERMNO": 11018, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBP"}
