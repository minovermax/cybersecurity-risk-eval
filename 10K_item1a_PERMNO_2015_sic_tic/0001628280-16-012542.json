The following discussion identifies those which we consider to be most important. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRISKS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE\nAn interruption of operations, a catastrophic event at our facilities, or a disruption of transportation services could negatively affect our business.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for various property damage and loss events, an interruption in or loss of operations at either of our facilities, or the facilities of ICP, could reduce or postpone production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. To the extent that our value-added products rely on unique or proprietary processes or techniques, replacing lost production by purchasing from outside suppliers becomes more difficult.\nOur customers store a substantial amount of barreled inventory of aged premium bourbon and rye whiskeys at our Lawrenceburg facility. If there was a catastrophic event at our Lawrenceburg facility, our customers' business could be adversely affected. The loss of a significant amount of aged inventory - through fire, natural disaster, or otherwise - could result in a significant reduction in supply of the affected product or products and, if we are negligent in the custodial care of our customers' inventory, this could result in customer claims against us.\nWe also store a substantial amount of our own inventory of aged premium bourbon and rye whiskeys at our Lawrenceburg facility. If there was a catastrophic event at our Lawrenceburg facility, our business could be adversely affected. The loss of a significant amount of our aged inventory - through fire, natural disaster, or otherwise - could result in a reduction in supply of the affected product or products and could affect our long-term growth.\nA disruption in transportation services could result in difficulties supplying materials to our facilities and impact our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner.\nAny business interruptions and the timing of the associated insurance recovery, if any, may cause volatility in our operating results.\nIn January 2014, we experienced a fire at our Lawrenceburg facility. During October 2014, we experienced a fire at our Atchison facility. We have reached final settlements for these business interruptions.\nBecause the timing and amount of a business interruption and the associated insurance recovery may differ, in the event of a business interruption, we may experience volatility in our future operating results.\nOur profitability is affected by the costs of energy, grain, and wheat flour that we use in our business, the availability and cost of which are subject to weather and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to recover the costs of commodities and energy by increasing our selling prices.\nGrain and wheat flour costs are a significant portion of our costs of goods sold. Historically, the cost of such raw materials has been subject to substantial fluctuation, depending upon a number of factors which affect commodity prices in general and over which we have no control. These include crop conditions, weather, disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition for acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities, purchases by foreign governments, and changes in demand resulting from population growth and customer preferences. The price of natural gas also fluctuates based on anticipated changes in supply and demand, weather and the prices of alternative fuels. Fluctuations in the price of commodities and natural gas can be sudden and volatile at times and have had, from time to time, significant adverse effects on the results of our operations. Higher energy costs could result in higher transportation costs and other operating costs.\nWe have eliminated futures and options contracts, because we can purchase grain and wheat flour for delivery up to 12 months into the future under our grain supply agreements. We intend to contract for the future delivery of grain and wheat flour, only to protect margins on expected sales. On the portion of volume not hedged, we will attempt to recover higher commodity costs through higher selling prices, but market considerations may not always permit this. Even where prices can be adjusted, there would likely be a lag between when we experience higher commodity or natural gas costs and when we might be able to increase prices. To the extent we are unable to timely pass increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers under sales contracts, market fluctuations in the cost of grain, natural gas and ethanol may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe source our grain and wheat flour from a limited number of suppliers.\nWe have signed supply agreements with Bunge Milling and CGB for our grain supply (primarily corn) and Ardent Mills for our wheat flour. If any of these companies encounters an operational or financial issue, or otherwise cannot meet our supply demands, it could lead to an interruption in supply to us and/or higher prices than those we have negotiated or than are available in the market at the time.\nRisks related to our 30 percent equity method investment in ICP:\nICP, like many others in the ethanol industry, in 2014 experienced high levels of profitability, resulting in a disproportionate share to our improvement in net income for the year ended December 31, 2014, and those levels may not recur. Because of ICP's strong financial performance in 2014, ICP was able to distribute cash to us, but this may not recur.\nOur proportionate share of the profits of ICP has recently had a significant positive impact on our net income. The significant earnings improvement from 2013 to 2014 was due to much improved margins in the production of chemical intermediates and high quality alcohol. The improved margins were driven primarily by a low current supply and strong demand for these products and for fuel grade alcohol, which affected their pricing. From 2014 to 2015, while ICP experienced lower sales volumes and a lower average per unit selling price, our proportionate share of the earnings of ICP results continued to have a positive impact on our earnings. We currently expect that ICP's recent levels of profitability may not be sustained and, as a consequence that ICP's contributions to our future net income may be reduced.\nOn December 4, 2014, we received a $4,835 cash dividend distribution from ICP. On February 26, 2016, we received a second cash dividend distribution from ICP in the amount of $3,300, which was our 30 percent ownership share of the total distribution, as declared in the Unanimous Written Consent of the Members of ICP, dated February 26, 2016 (see Notes 3, 14, and 18). There is no assurance cash dividend distributions will be received from ICP in the future.\nThe Company has a minority interest in ICP, which limits our ability to influence ICP's operations and profitability.\nWe have a minority interest in ICP of 30 percent, and have only two representatives on the six-member Advisory Board of ICP. Our minority ownership position and limited advisory role mean that our ability to influence operating decisions and affect profitability of the joint venture is limited. We do not control ICP's operations, strategies, or financial decisions. The majority equity owner may have economic, business or legal interests that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals we would set for ICP. We are dependent on the management of ICP and the other members of the Advisory Board to operate the joint venture profitably and take our interests into account. We must rely on others to implement beneficial management strategies, including appropriate risk management, internal controls over financial reporting, and compliance monitoring. The ICP Limited Liability Company Agreement generally allocates the profits, losses and distributions of cash of ICP based on our percentage membership interest in ICP which is derived from our capital contributions to ICP relative to the total contributions to ICP from all members. Our proportionate share of the earnings and losses are reflected in our financial statements. Any cash distributions from ICP (other than certain mandatory distributions for tax liabilities) must be approved by the Advisory Board, which we do not control.\nOur ability to supply our basic industrial alcohol business is highly dependent on sourcing the product from ICP or unaffiliated third parties.\nOur Atchison and Lawrenceburg facilities are constrained in their ability to produce additional volumes of industrial alcohol. ICP has been an important source of industrial alcohol in the past and will be expect this to continue into the foreseeable future along with other third party sources. While we plan to continue to source industrial alcohol from ICP in 2016, ICP is under no obligation to sell to us. If we are unsuccessful in sourcing product from ICP or other sources, our ability to supply our basic industrial alcohol business at current levels will be limited.\nWe have incurred impairment and restructuring losses in the past and may suffer such losses in the future.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment at year-end or if events or circumstances indicate that usage may be limited and carrying values may not be recoverable. Should events indicate the assets cannot be used as planned, the realization from alternative uses or disposal is compared to their carrying value. If an impairment loss is measured, this estimate is recognized and affects our profitability. Considerable judgment is used in these measurements, and a change in the assumptions could result in a different determination of impairment loss and/or the amount of any impairment.\nThe markets for our products are very competitive, and our results could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.\nThe markets for products in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these markets have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and several are much larger enterprises than us.\nWe are dependent on being able to generate net sales and other operating income in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins, profits and cash flows to meet or exceed our targeted financial performance measures. Competition is based on such factors as product innovation, product characteristics, product quality, pricing, color and name. Pricing of our products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring on-line idled capacity or to build new production capacity. If market conditions make our products too expensive for use in consumer goods, our revenues could be affected. If our principal competitors were to decrease their pricing, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues could be adversely affected due to the potential loss of sales or market share. Our revenue growth could also be adversely affected if we are not successful in developing new products for our customers or through new product introductions by our competitors. In addition, more stringent new customer demands may require us to make internal investments to achieve or sustain competitive advantage and meet customer expectations.\nUnsuccessful research activities or product launches could affect our profitability.\nResearch activities and product launch activities are inherently uncertain. The failure to launch a new product successfully can give rise to inventory write-offs and other costs and can affect consumer perception of an existing brand. Any significant changes in consumer preferences and failure to anticipate and react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products. If we were to have unsuccessful research activities or product launches, our profitability could be affected.\nWork disruptions or stoppages by our unionized workforce could cause interruptions in the Company\u2019s operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 158 of our 293 employees were members of a union. Although our relations with our two unions are stable and our labor contracts do not expire until December 2017 and August 2019, there is no assurance that we will not experience work disruptions or stoppages in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and adversely affect our relationships with our customers.\nIf we were to lose any of our key management personnel, we may not be able to fully implement our strategic plan, our system of internal controls could be impacted, and could lead to an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe rely on the continued services of key personnel involved in management, finance, product development, sales, manufacturing and distribution, and, in particular, upon the efforts and abilities of our executive management team. The loss of service of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and on our system of internal controls.\nIf we cannot attract and retain key management personnel, or if our search for qualified personnel is prolonged, our system of internal controls may be affected, and could lead to an adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, it could be difficult, time consuming and expensive to replace any key management member or other critical personnel, and no guarantee exists that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements or assimilate new key management personnel into our organization.\nCovenants and other provisions in our credit facility could hinder our ability to operate. Our failure to comply with covenants in our credit facility could result in the acceleration of the debt extended under such facility, limit our liquidity, and trigger other rights.\nOur credit agreement contains a number of financial and other covenants that include provisions which require us, in certain circumstances, to meet certain financial tests. These covenants could hinder our ability to operate and could reduce our profitability. In addition, our credit agreement permits the lender to modify borrowing base and advance rates, the effect of which may limit our available credit under the agreement. The lender may also terminate or accelerate our obligations under the credit agreement upon the occurrence of various events in addition to payment defaults and other breaches. Any acceleration of our debt, modification to reduce our borrowing base, or termination of our credit agreement would negatively impact our overall liquidity and may require us to take other actions to preserve any remaining liquidity. Although we anticipate that we will be able to meet the covenants in our credit agreement, there can be no assurance that we will do so, as there are a number of external factors that affect our operations over which we have little or no control.\nProduct recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us.\nSelling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. We could decide to, or be required to, recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination, adulteration, misbranding, tampering, or other deficiencies. Although we maintain product recall insurance, product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time. We could be adversely affected if our customers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products, or if consumers lose confidence in the food and beverage safety system generally. Adverse attention about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation, discourage consumers from buying our products, or cause production and delivery disruptions.\nWe may also suffer losses if our products or operations cause injury, illness, or death. In addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall, may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability or other legal or regulatory claim is unsuccessful, has no merit, or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and taxation, and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations, which may require us to incur substantial expenditures.\nWe are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the public health and the environment. Our operations are also subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the TTB, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, and the USEPA, and by various state and local authorities. Such regulations cover virtually every aspect of our operations, including production facilities, importing ingredients, distribution of beverage alcohol products, marketing, pricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, water usage, waste water discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and emissions and other matters.\nViolations of any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal fines or penalties being levied against us, including temporary or prolonged cessation of production, revocation or modification of permits, performance of environmental investigatory or remedial activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, or a cease and desist order against operations that are not in compliance. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations. These matters may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nA failure of one or more of our key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on information technology (IT) systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including laptops and mobile devices), software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed and hosted by third-party vendors to assist us in the management of our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks, and services include, but are not limited to: hosting our internal network and communication systems; enterprise resource planning; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; business plans, and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal, or tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. Although we have an offsite back-up system and disaster recovery plan, any failure of our information systems could adversely impact our ability to operate. Routine maintenance or development of new information systems may result in systems failures, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. This can lead to outside parties having access to privileged data or strategic information of the Company, our employees or customers. Any breach of our data security systems or failure of our information systems may have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive, or business harm, which may adversely affect our business operations or financial condition. In addition, such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, our employees, customers, and suppliers. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, in any of these events, we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems.\nDamage to our reputation, or that of any of our key customers or their brands, could affect our stock price and business performance.\nThe success of our products depends upon the positive image that consumers have of the third party brands that consume our products. Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our products and could affect the demand for our products. Unfavorable media, whether accurate or not, related to our industry or to us or our products, or to the brands that consume our products, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance or prospects could negatively affect our corporate reputation, stock price, ability to attract high-quality talent or the performance of our business. Adverse publicity or negative commentary on social media outlets could cause consumers to react rapidly by avoiding our brands or choosing brands offered by our competitors, which could materially negatively affect our financial results, business and financial condition.\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR DISTILLERY PRODUCTS SEGMENT\nThe relationship between the price we pay for grain and the sales prices of our distillery co-products can fluctuate significantly and affect our results of operations.\nDistillers feed, fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil are the principal co-products of our alcohol production process and can contribute in varying degrees to the profitability of our distillery products segment. Distillers feed and corn oil are sold for prices which historically have tracked the price of corn, but, certain of our co-products compete with similar products made from other plant feedstocks whose cost may not have risen in unison with corn prices. We sell fuel grade alcohol, the prices for which typically, but not always, have tracked price fluctuations in gasoline prices. As a result, the profitability of these products to us could be affected.\nOur strategic plan involves significant investment in the aging of barreled distillate. Decisions concerning the quantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate could affect our future profitability.\nThere is an inherent risk in determining the quantity of maturing stock of aged distillate to lay down in a given year for future sales as a result of changes in consumer demand, pricing, new brand launches, changes in product cycles, and other factors. Demand for products can change significantly between the time of production and the date of sale. It may be more difficult to make accurate prediction regarding new products and brands. Inaccurate decisions and/or estimations could lead to an inability to supply future demand or lead to a future surplus of inventory and consequent write-down in the value of maturing stocks of aged distillate. As a result, profitability of the distillery products segment could be affected.\nDisruption in the supply of oak barrels could negatively affect our business.\nNew oak barrels are available in significant and competitively-priced quantities from only a few sources. The industry continues to see a limited supply of oak barrels compared to the continued high demand for products aged in these barrels. A disruption in barrel supply, or an increase of market demand for barrels could limit our ability to fulfill our existing customer arrangements and our ability to lay down stock for our own use in future years at desired levels. The effect of our inability to lay down stock for our own use could also limit future growth and results of operations.\nIf the brands we develop do not achieve consumer acceptance, our growth may be limited and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nA component of our strategic plan is to develop our own brands, particularly whiskeys. Risks related to this strategy include:\n\u2022\nBecause our brands are early in their growth cycle or have not yet been developed, they have not achieved extensive brand recognition. Accordingly, if consumers do not accept our brands, we will not be able to penetrate our markets and our growth may be limited.\n\u2022\nWe depend, in part, on the marketing initiatives and efforts of our independent distributors in promoting our products and creating consumer demand and we have limited or no control regarding their promotional initiatives or the success of their efforts.\n\u2022\nWe depend on our independent distributors to distribute our products. The failure or inability of even a few of our independent distributors to adequately distribute our products within their territories could harm our sales and result in a decline in our results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company competes for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by its independent distributors, most of whom carry extensive product portfolios.\n\u2022\nThe laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of independent distributors, except under certain limited circumstances, making it difficult to terminate an independent distributor for poor performance without reasonable cause, as defined by applicable statutes. Any difficulty or inability to replace independent distributors, poor performance of the Company\u2019s major independent distributors or the Company\u2019s inability to collect accounts receivable from its major independent distributors could harm the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that the independent distributors and retailers the Company uses will continue to purchase the Company\u2019s products or provide Company products with adequate levels of promotional support.\nWarehouse expansion issues could affect our operations and/or adversely affect our financial results.\nOn October 21, 2015, we announced a $16,400 major expansion in warehousing capacity on a 20-acre campus adjoining the Company's current Lawrenceburg facility. In December 2015, our Board of Directors approved an additional $3,800 for a portion of the next phase of the project, for a total approved investment of $20,200. The program includes both the refurbishment of existing warehouse buildings and the construction of new warehouses. The first projects included in this program were completed in late 2015, with the remaining projects included in the total approved program expected to be completed by the end of 2016. While these expansion activities are progressing with no unanticipated issues, there is the potential risk of completion delays, which would affect our operations, and cost overruns, which would affect our financial results.\nWater scarcity or quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacity.\nWater is the main ingredient in substantially all of our distillery products. It is also a limited resource, facing unprecedented challenges from climate change, increasing pollution, and poor management. As demand for water continues to increase, water becomes more scarce and the quality of available water deteriorates, we may be affected by increasing production costs or capacity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial results.\nWe may be subject to litigation directed at the beverage alcohol industry and other litigation.\nCompanies in the beverage alcohol industry are, from time to time, exposed to class action or other litigation relating to alcohol advertising, product liability, alcohol abuse problems or health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. Such litigation may result in damages, penalties or fines as well as damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and financial results.\nAdverse public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products.\nIn recent years, there has been increased social and political attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry. The recent attention has focused largely on public health concerns related to alcohol abuse, including drunk driving, underage drinking, and the negative health impacts of the abuse and misuse of beverage alcohol.\nAnti-alcohol groups have, in the past, advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements, higher taxes and other regulations designed to discourage alcohol consumption. More restrictive regulations, higher taxes, negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could, in turn, significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue growth and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial results.\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR INGREDIENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT\nOur focus on higher margin specialty ingredients may make us more reliant on fewer, more profitable customer relationships.\nOur strategic plan for our ingredient solutions segment includes focusing our efforts on the sale of specialty proteins and starches to targeted domestic consumer packaged goods customers. Our major focus is directed at food ingredients, which are primarily used in foods that are developed to address consumers\u2019 desire for healthier and more convenient products; these consist of dietary fiber, wheat protein isolates and concentrates and textured wheat proteins. The bulk of our applications technology and research and development efforts are dedicated to providing customers with specialty ingredient solutions that deliver nutritional benefits, as well as desired functional and sensory qualities to their products. Our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected if our customers were to determine to reduce their new product development (\"NPD\") activities or cease using our unique dietary fibers, starches and proteins in their NPD efforts.\nProducts competing with our Fibersym\u00ae resistant starch could lead to decreasing margins and lower profitability.\nOur patent rights to Fibersym\u00ae expire in 2017. We face competition with our Fibersym\u00ae resistant starch. The competition could lead to diminished returns and lower our margins. We could face increased costs from intellectual property defense. These factors could result in significant costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and financial results.\nAdverse public opinion about any of our specialty ingredients could reduce demand for our products.\nConsumer preferences with respect to our specialty ingredients might change. In fact, in recent years, we have noticed shifting consumer preferences with respect to gluten and increased media attention directed at gluten intolerance. Shifting consumer preferences could decrease demand for our specialty ingredients. This could, in turn, significantly decrease our revenues and revenue growth, which could have a material adverse affect on our cash flows, financial condition and financial results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nCommon Stockholders have limited rights under our Articles of Incorporation.\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation, holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to elect five of our nine directors and only holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with respect to a merger, dissolution, lease, exchange or sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, or on an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, unless such action would increase or decrease the authorized shares or par value of the Common or Preferred Stock, or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Common or Preferred Stock so as to affect the holders of Common Stock adversely. Generally, the Common Stock and Preferred Stock vote as separate classes on all other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nThe majority of the outstanding shares of our Preferred Stock is beneficially owned by one individual, who is effectively in control of the election of five of our nine directors under the limited rights of the common stockholders under our Articles of Incorporation.\nThe trading volume in our Common Stock fluctuates depending on market conditions. The sale of a substantial number of shares in the public market could depress the price of our stock and make it difficult for stockholders to sell their shares.\nOur Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our public float at December 31, 2015 (including non-vested restricted stock awards held by non-affiliates) was approximately 12,390,680 shares, as approximately 4,291,096 shares are held by affiliates. Over the year ended December 31, 2015, our daily trading volume as reported to us by NASDAQ has fluctuated from 10,700 to 1,369,300 shares (excluding block trades). When trading volumes are relatively light, significant price changes can occur even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded and an investor\u2019s ability to quickly sell quantities of stock may be affected.", "PERMNO": 12226, "SIC": 2085, "TIC": "MGPI"}
