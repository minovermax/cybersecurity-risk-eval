RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOperating Risks\nGlobal health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our financial and operational performance.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to limit the spread of COVID-19 have had, and we expect will continue to have, certain impacts on our financial and operational performance, including the following:\n\u2022Deteriorating economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including economic slowdowns or recessions or significant disruptions in financial markets, could limit our ability to satisfy our debt obligations or impact the cost or availability of additional capital. As of September 30, 2020, we had $7,049.7 million in aggregate principal amount of debt and $1,187.9 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\u2022We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, reduced demand for our foodservice and certain on-the-go products due to reduced consumer traffic in restaurants, schools and other locations resulting from permanent and temporary customer closures, shelter-in-place regulations or recommendations and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic. Due to such reduced demand, during fiscal 2020, we temporarily idled certain of our facilities and delivered contract suspension notices to certain of our suppliers, invoking force majeure clauses, which have since been provisionally lifted, and we could become a party to litigation to enforce these force majeure clauses or otherwise enforce our rights under the Uniform Commercial Code. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists or intensifies, its negative impacts on demand for our foodservice or on-the-go products could be more prolonged and may become more severe, and we may in the future need to take similar or more aggressive actions.\n\u2022We have experienced, and could continue to experience, temporary workforce or other disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased employee absenteeism, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our ability to deliver our products. We have implemented employee safety measures at our manufacturing facilities, but these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees or protect against other impacts resulting from COVID-19. We have had, and may have future needs, to temporarily close individual production lines or entire manufacturing facilities either due to a widespread employee outbreak, sanitizings or related operational interruptions or for other reasons related to COVID-19.\n\u2022The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our and our third party manufacturers\u2019 operations has included, and could in the future include, increases in the cost or reductions in the availability of ingredients, packaging and other materials used to manufacture our products and has resulted in, and could result in additional, interruptions in our supply chain.\n\u2022We have incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating costs, including facility reconfiguration costs to enhance social distancing, purchases of equipment and supplies that are in high demand, costs to engage third party resources and costs for employee health screenings and facility sanitizings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving understanding of the science and best practices. In addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional expenses to comply with new requirements imposed by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter (such as occurred for certain of our retail products in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and continued through the second half of fiscal 2020), which in certain cases has exceeded and could continue to exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Further, while we experienced increased demand for certain of our retail products in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 that continued through the second half of fiscal 2020, this increase may moderate or reverse in future periods if consumers alter their purchasing habits. Consumer perceptions of our Company\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and any perceived quality or health concerns (whether or not valid) regarding our products, could affect our brand value.\n\u2022Significant policy changes in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products (including quarantines, import or export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions) could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.\n\u2022Continued business disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on planned timelines.\nThese and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened, or in some cases manifested, other risks set forth below, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of as of the date hereof. The extent and potential short and long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could be material, will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, actions that have and may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, changing consumer behaviors and the impact on our supply chain, operations, workforce and the financial markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe operate in categories with strong competition.\nThe consumer food and beverage and convenient nutrition categories are highly competitive. Competition in these categories is based on, among other things, brand recognition and loyalty, taste, nutritional value, ingredients, product quality, price, product availability, variety, innovation, distribution, packaging, convenience, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our competitors may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive and customer pressures, as well as industry supply and market demand, also may limit our ability to increase prices, including in response to cost increases. In most product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a shift in consumer preferences to competitors\u2019 products, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks and digital platforms to advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment and use social media and digital platforms effectively, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences and behaviors.\nConsumer and customer preferences and behaviors evolve over time due to a variety of factors. The success of our business depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and behaviors and to continue to develop and offer products that appeal to consumers and customers through the sales channels that they prefer. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages, consumer at-home and on-the-go consumption patterns, preferences for certain sales channels, such as eCommerce, concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, attention to sourcing practices relating to ingredients, animal welfare concerns, environmental concerns regarding packaging and attention to other social and governance aspects of our Company and operations. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences and behaviors and our inability to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring the second quarter and continuing throughout the second half of fiscal 2020, our products sold through the food, drug and mass, club and eCommerce channels experienced an increase in sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while our foodservice product sales were negatively impacted by lower demand resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various channels. In addition, during the second half of fiscal 2020, we experienced declines in sales of certain on-the-go products as a result of increased at-home consumption. If these trends continue into the future and we are unable to adapt our business in response to these consumer behaviors, or if these trends are temporary and we fail to quickly respond as they moderate or reverse, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. In addition, consumers are increasingly shopping through eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this trend is significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding eCommerce market or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses are, and will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the housing of egg-laying hens, as well as certain other farm animals. Many restaurant chains, foodservice companies and grocery chains have announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply, as well as goals for other farm animal initiatives, by specified future dates. Meeting anticipated customer demand has resulted, and will continue to result, in\nadditional operating and capital costs to procure cage-free eggs, to modify existing layer facilities and to construct new cage-free layer housing. In addition, several states have enacted, or are proposing, provisions providing for specific requirements for the housing of certain farm animals, which we expect will require us to incur additional operating and capital costs in the future. Also, our retail businesses are, and will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the environmental impact of food packaging. Several of our customers have announced goals to transition to recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging. These changing preferences and requirements could require us to use specially sourced ingredients and packaging types that may be more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment which we may not be able to pass on to customers.\nOur results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands.\nMaintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including adverse publicity about us, our business practices, products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products, our products becoming unavailable to consumers or consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner. In addition, negative perceptions of the food and beverage industry as a whole, or segments of the food and beverage industry in which we operate, may heighten attention from consumers, third parties, the media, governments, shareholders and other stakeholders to such factors and could adversely affect our brand image. Such pressures also could lead to stricter regulations, industry self-regulation that is unevenly adopted among companies and increased focus on food marketing practices. Consumer demand for our products also may be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our business practices, brands, products, ingredients, packaging, suppliers or third party manufacturers or the food and beverage industry generally (whether or not valid) in the media, especially on social or digital media, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. Further, third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks. If consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand, they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future, which could harm our brand image and sales. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nUncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could limit consumer and customer demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect us.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions and consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits. In periods of adverse or uncertain economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers may purchase less of our products or may forgo certain purchases altogether. In addition, our customers may seek to reduce their inventories in response to those economic conditions. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of our products. Also, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect profit margins. Further, uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact the financial stability of our customers or suppliers, which could lead to increased uncollectible receivables or non-performance. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDisruption of our supply chain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn coordination with our suppliers, business partners and third party manufacturers, our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, governmental restrictions or mandates, border closures, weather, freight carrier availability, any potential effects of climate change, natural disasters, agricultural diseases, fires or evacuations related thereto, explosions, cyber-attacks, terrorism, strikes or other labor unrest, repairs or enhancements at our facilities or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. Changes in weather conditions, agricultural diseases and natural disasters also may affect the cost and supply of commodities and manufacturing materials, including grains, eggs, sows, potatoes, cheese, proteins and sugar and other sweeteners, or result in lower recoveries of usable raw materials. Competitors can be affected differently by any of these events depending on the location of their suppliers and operations. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of any of these events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a commodity or raw material is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nIn addition, the manufacturing capabilities for certain of our products are concentrated with certain third party manufacturers and at certain of our and our third party manufacturers\u2019 facilities. If we had to close or limit production of all or part of the operations at one or more of such facilities for any reason, or if certain of our facilities or such third party manufacturers were unable to produce our desired quantities, we may be unable to increase production at our other facilities or with other third party manufacturers in a timely manner, which could adversely affect our customer relationships, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs previously discussed, during fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our operations, including temporary workforce disruptions and other disruptions in our supply chain. The increased demand for certain of our retail products during the COVID-19 pandemic has in certain cases exceeded our production capacity and could continue to do so in the future or otherwise strain our supply chain. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our supply chain and operations; however, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and changes in consumer behaviors.\nWe are currently dependent upon third party suppliers and manufacturers for the manufacturing of many of our products. Our business could suffer as a result of a third party\u2019s inability to supply materials for our products or produce our products for us on time or to our specifications.\nOur business relies on independent third parties for the supply of materials for, and the manufacture of, many products, such as RTD protein shakes, protein bars and powders, nutritional supplements, breakfast drinks, certain cereal and granola products, shell eggs, dairy products, potatoes and certain refrigerated food products. Our business could be materially affected if we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these third parties, if these third parties fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties ceases doing business with us or goes out of business. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with these third parties, such as increases in costs, reductions in the availability of materials or production capacity, errors in complying with specifications, insufficient quality control and failures to meet production or shipment deadlines, including as a result of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases. The inability of a third party supplier or manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nCertain of our relationships with these third party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby the third party manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product and the third party supplier has committed to provide, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of materials, respectively. Despite these commitments, we may nonetheless experience situations where such third parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under our agreements or cannot produce or supply, as applicable, adequate amounts to allow us to meet customer demands. For example, due to a combination of better than expected volume growth for our Premier Protein RTD shakes in the second half of fiscal 2018 and delays in planned incremental production capacity by our third party contract manufacturer network, customer demand for Premier Protein RTD shakes exceeded available capacity and resulted in inventory of our Premier Protein RTD shakes below acceptable levels at September 30, 2018. Alternately, we could incur penalties if we do not purchase the minimum quantities provided under these commitments. In addition, certain of our relationships with these third party manufacturers and suppliers are not subject to supply commitments, and we may not be able to obtain such commitments in a timely manner or at all. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our third party manufacturers\u2019 operations combined with a lack of contractual commitments has resulted in and continues to result in shortages in certain of our Crystal Farms products.\nIncreased input costs, including costs for freight, raw materials, energy and other supplies, or limited availability of such inputs could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur freight costs may increase due to factors such as increased fuel costs, limited carrier availability, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases and inflation. The primary ingredients used by our business include wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, eggs, pork, pasta, potatoes, cheese, milk, butter, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit and nuts. The supply and price of these ingredients are subject to market conditions and are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, animal feed costs, weather patterns affecting ingredient production, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases and inflation. Our primary packaging materials include folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging, and aseptic foil and plastic lined cartonboard. In addition, our manufacturing operations use large quantities of natural gas, propane, electricity, carbon dioxide, sanitizing supplies and personal protective equipment. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely, and we may experience shortages in such items as a result of commodity availability, increased demand, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of\ncontagious diseases, weather conditions and natural disasters, as well as other factors outside of our control. Higher prices for natural gas, propane, electricity and fuel also may increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced volatility in the prices of raw materials, energy and other supplies. In addition, we have been experiencing shortages of carbon dioxide used by our Refrigerated Retail business as a cooling agent during sausage production, which has resulted in us paying increased costs for this input and impacted our ability to produce products and could continue to do so in the future. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional costs, including costs for facility reconfigurations to enhance social distancing, personal protective equipment, employee health screenings and facility sanitizings and to secure sources of alternate supply for certain inputs.\nOur Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments\u2019 operating results are significantly affected by egg, sow, potato and cheese prices and the prices of corn and soybean meal, which are the primary grains fed to laying hens. Historically, the prices of these raw materials have fluctuated widely, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our Refrigerated Retail segment\u2019s cheese and butter products are affected by milk price supports established by the USDA or government inventory purchasing programs. Although steps can be taken to mitigate the effects of changes in raw material costs, fluctuations in prices are outside of our control, and changes in the price of such items may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain supply and demand disruptions, such as those resulting from diseases affecting livestock and those experienced with the 2013 PEDV swine outbreak and the 2015 avian influenza outbreak, could create an inability to keep selling prices in line with input costs and may result in significant fluctuations in operating profit margins.\nThe prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our input costs at the time they occur or at all. Accordingly, changes in input costs may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we try to manage the impact of increases in certain of these costs by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our anticipated production requirements, if we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors\u2019 costs, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness (such as COVID-19).\nWe depend upon the skills, working relationships and continued services of key personnel, including our senior management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to operate and expand our business. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nOur business is dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience periods where our employees are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced temporary workforce disruptions and periods where we temporarily closed manufacturing lines or partial facilities. These events, or if similar events occur in the future, could have a material adverse impact on us in the future.\nIf our products become adulterated or contaminated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.\nSelling food products, beverages and nutritional supplements involves a number of legal and other risks, including contamination, spoilage, degradation, tampering, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the ingredients used to make certain of our products, particularly eggs, pork, nuts, raw potatoes and grains, are vulnerable to contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella. These pathogens may survive in our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. We may need to recall, withdraw or isolate some or all of our products if they become damaged, adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our supply chain. Such an incident could result in destruction of product ingredients and inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. New scientific discoveries regarding microbes and food manufacturing may bring additional risks and latent liability. Should consumption of any product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a judgment against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers or customers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Any of these events, including a\nsignificant product liability claim against us, could result in a loss of consumer or customer confidence in our products and damage our brands. Although we have various insurance programs in place, any of these events or a loss of consumer or customer confidence could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or the bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA limited number of customer accounts represents a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 20.9% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020. Walmart also is the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, accounting for 31.4% of Post Consumer Brands\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2020. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco, Walmart and Sainsbury\u2019s, accounted for 40.1% of Weetabix\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2020. The largest customers of our Foodservice segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for 35.8% of the segment\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2020. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Retail segment, Walmart and Kroger, accounted for 31.7% of the segment\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2020, and the largest customers of our BellRing Brands segment, Costco and Walmart, accounted for 67.3% of the segment\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2020. For purposes of this risk factor, \u201cWalmart\u201d refers to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, which include Sam\u2019s Club and Asda.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through high-volume food distributors, retailers, club stores, supercenters and mass merchandisers. The competition to supply products to these high-volume customers is intense. Currently, we do not have long-term supply agreements with a substantial number of our retail customers, including our largest customers. These high-volume customers frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, including in response to shifts in consumer purchasing or traffic trends attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our customers may offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments operate in the historically mature RTE cereal category, and the failure or weakening of this category could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments produce and distribute branded, licensed and private label RTE cereals and hot cereals, other cereal-based food products and muesli, selling products to grocery stores, discounters, big box retailers, foodservice distributors, wholesalers and convenience stores primarily across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and Ireland. While the RTE cereal category has experienced strong demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the RTE cereal category had previously been experiencing weakness in recent years. Although we expect some of the benefit in the RTE cereal category experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic to be long-lasting, continuing weakness in the RTE cereal category, or the weakening of our major products competing in this category, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConsolidation in the retail and foodservice distribution channels, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our profit margins.\nOver the past several years, the retail and foodservice channels have undergone significant consolidations and mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers are gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other value brands and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond to these requirements, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our existing retailer or distributor customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired retailer or distributor. Further, the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the growth of online food retailers and new market participants, and our customers\u2019 responses to those changes could impact our business. The consolidation in the retail and foodservice channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers\u2019 business operations or financial performance, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, would have a corresponding material adverse effect on us.\nOur sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration, enter into new markets and enhance our product portfolio with innovative and profitable products.\nSuccessful growth depends upon our ability to add new retail and foodservice customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio with new innovative and profitable products. This growth would include expanding the number of our products our customers offer for sale and our product placement. The expansion of the business of our existing segments depends upon our ability to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, large-account customers, such as grocery store chains, mass merchandisers and foodservice distributors. Our failure to successfully add new customers, enter into new markets, expand our business with existing, large-account customers or enhance our product portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For some of our businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our innovation and growth efforts as a result of reduced demand for certain products or as our customers have modified their shelf reset timings, reduced in store-displays and promotional activities and shifted their ordering patterns to focus on our core products for shipments, which could adversely impact our sales and profit growth.\nOur or 8th Avenue\u2019s private label products may not be able to compete successfully with nationally branded products.\nWe participate in the private brand food category, producing and distributing private label products, including through our investment in 8th Avenue. In many cases, competitors with nationally branded products have a competitive advantage over private label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label producers and distributors becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant. Competitive pressures or promotions of branded products could cause us, 8th Avenue or our or 8th Avenue\u2019s customers to lose sales, which may require us or 8th Avenue to lower prices or increase the use of discounting or promotional programs, each of which would adversely affect our or 8th Avenue\u2019s margins, business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\n\u2022unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export or import restrictions;\n\u2022unfavorable foreign exchange controls and currency exchange rates;\n\u2022challenges associated with cross-border product distribution;\n\u2022an outbreak of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, which may cause us or our distributors, third party manufacturers, vendors or customers to temporarily suspend our or their respective operations in the affected city or country;\n\u2022increased exposure to general market and economic conditions, political and economic uncertainty and volatility and other events, including social unrest, government shutdowns, terrorist activity, acts of war and travel restrictions, outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. laws and regulations affecting operations outside of the U.S., including anti-corruption regulations (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and changes to such laws and regulations;\n\u2022compliance with treaties, antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws (including the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation), anti-corruption laws (including the U.K. Bribery Act), food safety laws and other regulatory requirements and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions and changes to such laws and regulations;\n\u2022changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications;\n\u2022the potential difficulty of enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights;\n\u2022increased risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\n\u2022unfavorable changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations;\n\u2022the difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;\n\u2022the difficulty and costs of maintaining effective data security; and\n\u2022unfavorable or changing foreign tax treaties and policies.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our principal exposure is to the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit may cause increased regulatory complexity and economic volatility and could result in tariffs, which could adversely affect our operations and business.\nThe exit of the U.K. from the E.U. (\u201cBrexit\u201d) has created uncertainty surrounding our business. The effects of Brexit depend on any agreement the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Further, our business could be adversely impacted by tariffs on imports to the U.K. as well as exports from the U.K.\nThese developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, tariffs could impact the ability of our Weetabix business to continue to sell product in some of the markets where it currently does business.\nAgricultural diseases or pests could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our business activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks, including diseases and pests, which can adversely affect the quality and quantity of the raw materials we use and the products we produce and distribute (or have produced or distributed by third parties), as well as increase the costs of production. Any actual or potential contamination of our products could result in product recalls, market withdrawals, product detentions, safety alerts, cessation of manufacturing or distribution or, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA, USDA or other U.S. or international regulatory authority requirements, enforcement actions. We also could be subject to product liability claims or adverse publicity if any of our products are alleged to have caused illness or injury.\nAvian influenza occasionally affects the domestic poultry industry, leading to hen deaths. In 2015, an avian influenza outbreak occurred in the Midwest of the U.S., affecting a substantial portion of our owned and third party contracted flocks. Although we utilize biosecurity measures at our layer locations to protect against disease exposures, if our facilities are exposed to diseases and pests, such exposure could affect a substantial portion of our production facilities in any year and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Diseases affecting livestock (including PEDV) occasionally impact sow supply, which also could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLabor strikes or work stoppages by our employees could harm our business.\nSome of our full-time production, maintenance and warehouse employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could result in production interruptions caused by work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are currently renegotiating our collective bargaining agreement at our Post Consumer Brands manufacturing plant in Battle Creek, Michigan, which, as of November 1, 2020, covered approximately 500 employees. There is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement in a timely manner, and if an agreement is not reached, there could be an interruption in production at that facility. In addition, we could be subject to unionization efforts at our non-union facilities. Increased unionization of our workforce could lead to disruptions in our business, increases in our operating costs and constraints on our operating flexibility.\nIn the event of a work stoppage, we have contingency plans in place to hire additional labor or manufacture products in other locations to mitigate disruption to our business. However, there are limitations inherent in any plan to mitigate disruption to our business in the event of a work stoppage, and particularly in the case of a prolonged work stoppage, there can be no assurance that it would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change, or legal or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If any of these climate changes has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials that are necessary for our products, including wheat, oats and other grain products, proteins, eggs, potatoes and sows. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters may result in damage and disruptions to our manufacturing operations and distribution channels or our third party manufacturers\u2019\noperations, particularly where a product is primarily sourced from a single location. Also, the impacts of these climate changes may cause unpredictable water availability or exacerbate water scarcity. Water is critical to our business, and the lack of available water of acceptable quality may lead to, among other things, adverse effects on our operations. The increasing concern over climate change and related environmental sustainability matters also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements, including requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or conserve and replenish water. If such laws are enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. Further, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively address increased concerns from the media, shareholders and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability and governance matters. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nActual operating results may differ significantly from our or BellRing\u2019s guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance, the future performance of some or all of our unconsolidated and consolidated subsidiaries or the expected future performance of companies or businesses that we have agreed to acquire. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and certain factors described in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included herein relates to our previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecasted. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nSimilarly, BellRing, as a separate publicly-traded company whose financial results are consolidated into Post\u2019s financial statements, releases guidance regarding its future performance, which consists of forward-looking statements. These statements are prepared by BellRing\u2019s management, and we do not accept any responsibility for any such statements.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nOur business strategy depends upon us identifying and completing additional acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic transactions in the future. Our corporate development activities also may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we continuously evaluate strategic transactions, we may be unable to identify suitable strategic transactions in the future or may not be able to enter into such transactions at favorable prices or on terms that are favorable to us. Alternatively, we may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions, and any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, investment or merger, for cash or in exchange for our equity securities, a divestiture or a joint venture.\nEvaluating potential transactions, including divestitures and joint ventures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support any acquired entities and information technology, personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters.\nOur corporate development activities also may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to certain intangible\nassets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of the IPO of a minority interest in our BellRing Brands business, which consists of our historical active nutrition business, we are subject to various risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of the IPO and the formation transactions, BellRing Brands, LLC is the holding company for our historical active nutrition business. Effective October 21, 2019, BellRing became a holding company owning 28.8% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, and Post owns one share of BellRing\u2019s Class B common stock and 71.2% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units. For so long as Post or its affiliates (other than BellRing and its subsidiaries) directly own more than 50% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, the share of Class B common stock represents 67% of the combined voting power of the common stock of BellRing.\nWe may not be able to achieve the anticipated strategic and financial benefits expected as a result of the IPO. In addition, as a result of the IPO and the formation transactions, we only benefit from a portion of any profits and growth of the BellRing Brands business, and our historical financial information prior to the IPO may not be comparable to or indicative of future results. Further, the BellRing Brands business is subject to additional costs as a result of being a standalone public company.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nWe have acquired multiple businesses, and we may continue to acquire other businesses. The successful integration of these acquisitions depends upon our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses on the part of both us and the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022employees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate employment from us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions;\n\u2022our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses;\n\u2022we may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management, including integrating or separating personnel, financial systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022integration may be more costly, time-consuming or complex or less effective than anticipated;\n\u2022inability to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and\n\u2022we may discover previously undetected operational or other issues, such as fraud.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our and the acquired businesses\u2019 ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies.\nIn addition, the success of these acquired businesses will depend, in part, upon our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing businesses. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\nFinancial Risks\nU.S. and global capital and credit market issues, including those that have arisen or may arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nU.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. This and other events affecting the credit markets also have had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S., which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or refinance our existing debt, sell our assets or borrow money, if necessary. Our business also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy, whether resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Any of\nthese risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business or increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record additional impairment charges, which may be significant.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other acquired intangibles. Intangibles and goodwill expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but our management reviews them for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA (which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. We also continue to evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fair value of our intangible assets. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. In fiscal 2020, we had no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets. In fiscal 2019, we had an impairment of both goodwill and other definite-lived intangible assets. In fiscal 2018, we had an impairment of other indefinite-lived intangible assets and no impairment of goodwill. See further discussion of these impairments in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this report and Notes 2 and 7 within \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8 of this report.\nUnsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such strategies, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our costs, such as freight, raw materials and energy, are outside of our control. Therefore, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, or if the implementation of these projects results in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees or reduced productivity, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic has, in certain instances, resulted in delays of certain cost-saving and productivity initiatives. Continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives or impact our ability to complete projects to reduce costs or improve efficiency on planned timelines. In addition, if the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the transactions to separately capitalize 8th Avenue, we have less control over our historical private brands business, and certain of our historical financial information may not be comparable with our future financial performance. In addition, if our investment in 8th Avenue is not profitable, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nEffective October 1, 2018, 8th Avenue, which became the holding company for our historical private brands business, was separately capitalized by us and third parties (the transactions to separately capitalize 8th Avenue are referred to as the \u201c8th Avenue Transactions\u201d). As a result of the 8th Avenue Transactions, we hold 6.05 million shares of 8th Avenue Class B common stock, and third parties and members of 8th Avenue\u2019s management team together hold 3.95 million shares of 8th Avenue Class A common stock and 2.5 million shares of 8th Avenue Series A preferred stock. Although we hold a substantial majority of the voting power of 8th Avenue\u2019s common stock and have the power to appoint a majority of the members of 8th Avenue\u2019s board of directors, third parties hold certain corporate governance and other rights with respect to 8th Avenue, and we cannot control the actions of such third parties. Such third parties may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with each other and our business interests or goals. Differences in views among the owners of 8th Avenue may result in delayed decisions or disputes. In addition, such third parties could sell their interests in 8th Avenue, or 8th Avenue or its subsidiaries could be disposed of, in whole or in part, to other third parties with different views or economic or business interests or goals. These factors could potentially adversely impact the business and operations of 8th Avenue and, in turn, our business and operations.\nIn connection with the 8th Avenue Transactions, as of October 1, 2018, 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries were deconsolidated from our financial statements. As a result, our balance sheets and statements of operations following the deconsolidation are not and will not be comparable to the balance sheets and statements of operations reflected in our historical financial statements for periods prior to deconsolidation.\nAs of October 1, 2018, our 60.5% retained interest in 8th Avenue is accounted for using the equity method, and the carrying value of the investment in 8th Avenue is included on our balance sheet and returns from our investment in 8th Avenue are included in our results of operations. If our investment in 8th Avenue is not profitable, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nVolatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations of our manufacturing costs will cause volatility in our margins and net earnings.\nWe utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings, resulting in volatility in our margins and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and in unallocated corporate items outside of our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.\nChanging currency exchange rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have operations and assets in the U.S. as well as foreign jurisdictions, and a portion of our contracts and revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. We therefore must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in value of our net foreign currency investment, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nWe may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses to our qualified pension and other postretirement plans, which could negatively impact profits.\nWe maintain and contribute to qualified defined benefit plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. primarily for our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix businesses. With respect to those plans we maintain, we are obligated to ensure that these plans are funded or paid in accordance with applicable regulations. In the event the assets in which we invest do not perform according to expectations, or the valuation of the projected benefit obligation increases due to changes in interest rates or other factors, we may be required to make significant cash contributions to these plans and recognize increased expense on our financial statements.\nIncreases in labor-related costs, including the costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits, may reduce our profitability.\nInflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Labor costs also include the costs of providing medical and other health and welfare benefits to our employees as well as certain former employees. With approximately 10,200 employees as of November 1, 2020 (which excludes the employees of our unconsolidated subsidiaries), our profitability may be substantially affected by the costs of such benefits. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in health care laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. In addition, we continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these costs. Any substantial increase in these costs could negatively affect our profitability.\nLegal, Regulatory and Technology Risks\nViolations of laws or regulations, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or to interpretations thereof, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government authorities in the U.S., as well as government authorities outside of the U.S., including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling and distribution, animal welfare, worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both inside and outside of the U.S., are subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal, state and local authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and California\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). In Europe, we are regulated by, among other authorities, the U.K.\u2019s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in E.U. member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world where our products are distributed or licensed. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, import and export restrictions, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy and immigration and labor issues, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or the businesses of our customers or suppliers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and may be subject to initiatives to limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, changes in these laws or regulations or interpretations thereof or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers, suppliers or third party manufacturers, causing our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. As specific examples, Canada has enacted new food safety laws, and some states have passed laws that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs, which we expect will result in us incurring additional operating and capital costs in the future.\nIt also is possible that federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties, revocations of required licenses or injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or permits, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter and/or institute enforcement actions that could result in additional costs, product detentions, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales while the non-conformances are rectified. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market, and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any claims, such as product liability or labeling claims, resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations. The limited availability of government inspectors due to a government shutdown, government restrictions, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases or closed borders also could cause disruption to our manufacturing facilities.\nWe also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, product and equipment seizures, import and export restrictions, price controls, governmental and regulatory actions, mandatory business closures and other restrictions that could adversely impact our operations. The U.S., Canada and Mexico have renegotiated and replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) with the U.S., Mexico, Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d). While we currently do not anticipate that the USMCA will have a material impact on our results, we continue to closely monitor the impact of USMCA on our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses.\nCertain of our Foodservice, Refrigerated Retail and BellRing Brands products are subject to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny, resulting in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales.\nCertain of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses\u2019 meat and egg products are subject to continuous on-site inspections by the USDA. Some of our BellRing Brands products are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, which are subject to FDA regulations and levels of regulatory scrutiny that are different from those applicable to conventional food. Internationally, certain of our BellRing Brands products are regulated as food and dietary supplements and, in some cases, may be regulated as drug products. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny results in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales. In addition, there is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs.\nPending and future litigation may impair our reputation or cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, including as a result of the contract suspension notices delivered to certain of our suppliers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. There has been a recent increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in legal claims or litigation against us. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation or brands. In addition, we may incur substantial costs and fees in defending such actions or asserting our rights, be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with these litigation matters, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to certain continuing obligations, including indemnification obligations and lease guarantor obligations, related to the sale of the Bob Evans restaurants business that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2017, prior to our acquisition of Bob Evans, Bob Evans completed the sale and separation of its restaurants business (the \u201cBob Evans Restaurants Transaction\u201d) to Bob Evans Restaurants, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed by affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the \u201cBob Evans Restaurants Buyer\u201d), pursuant to a sale agreement between Bob Evans and the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer (the \u201cRestaurants Sale Agreement\u201d). As a result of our acquisition of Bob Evans, we have the obligation to indemnify the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer for certain breaches of the Restaurants Sale Agreement and certain other liabilities set forth in the Restaurants Sale Agreement.\nIn addition, in connection with the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction, the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed the lease obligations of the Bob Evans restaurants business. However, as part of a sale leaseback transaction of 143 of Bob Evans\u2019s restaurant properties that Bob Evans completed in 2016, Bob Evans and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into payment and performance guarantees relating to the leases on such restaurant properties, which remained in place after the completion of the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction. Although the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed responsibility for the payment and performance obligations under the leases on the sale leaseback properties, under the terms of the guarantees, we remain liable for payments due under these leases, subject in certain cases to certain early termination allowances, if the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer fails to satisfy its lease obligations. Any such unexpected expenses related to our obligations under the payment and performance guarantees or under the Restaurants Sale Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTermination of our material intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe market certain of our products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and several other locations pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. These licenses give us the right to use certain names, characters and logos in connection with our products and to sell the products in certain regions. If we were to breach any material term of these license agreements and not timely cure the breach, the licensor could terminate the agreement. If the licensor were to terminate our rights to use the names, characters and logos for this reason or any other reason, or if a licensor decided not to renew a license agreement upon the expiration of the license term, the loss of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and licenses, to be a significant and valuable asset of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as exclusive and nonexclusive licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements, confidentiality provisions in third party agreements and the policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business. In addition, as certain of our trademarks, trade names and trade secrets are subject to licenses and are shared and used by third parties, negative events outside of our control could have an adverse impact on us and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible; divert management\u2019s attention and resources; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could require us to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain products, any or all of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nTechnology failures, cybersecurity incidents or corruption of our data privacy protections could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, including production, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and control costs. We also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, third party manufacturers and suppliers. The importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our and our third party vendors\u2019 information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of invasions, interruptions or malfunctions due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hardware or software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other causes. Such invasions, interruptions or malfunctions could negatively impact our business.\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our third party service providers fails to provide the services we require, we could be subject to, among other things, billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by individuals and groups (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons).\nIf any of our significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation and reputational damage from leaks of confidential or personal information. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. Although we have not detected a material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nWe also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding personal information, data privacy, data protection and data security. Several foreign governments have laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their data subjects, including the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of such laws and regulations. The invalidation of the privacy shield transfer mechanism between the U.S. and the E.U. under E.U. law exposes us to additional risks related to personal information obtained from E.U. data subjects.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. In addition, our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses are subject to particular federal and state requirements governing animal housing and feeding operations and the management of animal waste, which we expect will result in us incurring additional operating and capital costs in the future. Certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. We cannot predict the impact that such regulations may have, or that climate change may otherwise have, on our business.\nFuture events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring response action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. We had $7,049.7 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt as of September 30, 2020. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility had borrowing capacity of $731.2 million at September 30, 2020 (all of which would be secured when drawn). BellRing Brands, LLC, a subsidiary of BellRing, had $703.7 million in aggregate principal amount of debt, which is included in our total debt amount referenced earlier in this paragraph, and borrowing capacity of $170.0 million under its secured revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2020. Post and its\nsubsidiaries (other than BellRing Brands, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries) are not obligors or guarantors under the BellRing Brands, LLC debt facilities.\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, for capital expenditures, for acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our financing arrangements;\n\u2022trigger limitations on our ability to deduct interest paid on such indebtedness;\n\u2022limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, potential changes in consumer and customer preferences and behaviors, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or issue additional equity.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks related to our debt and leverage.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, as defined in the documents governing our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes, contain, or may in future financings contain, various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to refinance our existing indebtedness. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and could additionally require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to pay dividends, respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022borrow money or guarantee debt;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock or other securities;\n\u2022make investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022enter into new lines of business;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022sell assets or merge with other companies.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements containing cross-default provisions.\nOur credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant requiring us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of any fiscal quarter if, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, the aggregate outstanding amount of all revolving credit loans, swing line loans and letter of credit obligations (subject to certain exceptions specified in our credit agreement) exceeds 30% of our revolving credit commitments. Our credit agreement permits us to incur other secured or unsecured debt, in all cases subject to conditions and limitations on the amount as specified in our credit agreement. BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s credit agreement (the \u201cBellRing LLC credit agreement\u201d) contains a financial covenant requiring BellRing Brands, LLC to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the BellRing LLC credit agreement) not to exceed 6.00 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the fiscal quarter that ended March 31, 2020.\nA default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under our indentures and credit agreement. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants in our debt, and their financial resources and assets may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness.\nWe have designated 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries and BellRing and its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under our credit agreement and senior note indentures. Any subsidiary that is designated as unrestricted is not a guarantor under our credit agreement or under our senior note indentures, and the assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries do not secure our obligations under our credit agreement. 8th Avenue and BellRing Brands, LLC have entered into secured credit facilities that are separate from our credit agreement and senior note indentures and that restrict, among other matters, their ability to make distributions to us or engage in transactions with us. Accordingly, the financial resources and other assets of 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries and BellRing Brands, LLC and its subsidiaries may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness or, if available, may be significantly limited.\nTo service our indebtedness and other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends upon many factors beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.\nOur ability to pay interest on our outstanding senior notes, to satisfy our other debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the impact of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including:\n\u2022sales of assets;\n\u2022sales of equity;\n\u2022reduction or delay of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or\n\u2022negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in a sufficient amount, to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the senior notes and our other debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect earnings.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we did not have debt outstanding with exposure to interest rate risk. However, in the future, we may have debt outstanding with exposure to interest rate risk. In addition, the aggregate principal amount of BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was $703.7 million as of September 30, 2020. Higher interest rates\nwill increase the cost of servicing our and BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of September 30, 2020, each one hundred basis points change in London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) would result in an approximate $4.0 million change in the annual cash interest expense, before any principal payment, on BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk, including the impact of the $350.0 million in interest rate swap agreements held by BellRing Brands, LLC and excluding the impact of any interest rate floors (as defined in the BellRing Brands, LLC credit agreement). At September 30, 2020, we held interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $2,371.0 million, excluding the interest rate swaps held by BellRing Brands, LLC, to lock into a fixed LIBOR rate for debt expected to be issued but not yet priced.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Certain of BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s variable rate debt and our secured revolving credit facility use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. In addition, certain hedging transactions reference LIBOR as a benchmark rate in order to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. In the event LIBOR is discontinued, replaced or significantly changed, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable benchmark, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending upon the terms of the governing instrument. This could result in different financial performance for existing transactions, require different hedging strategies and require renegotiation for existing instruments. In addition, the transition from LIBOR could have a significant impact on the overall interest rate environment. While we do not expect the transition from LIBOR and the risks related thereto to have a material adverse effect on us, it remains uncertain at this time.\nOur borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets could be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based upon a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all and result in a reduction in our liquidity. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets also can be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nYour percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any publicly-traded company, our shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees and the vesting of those equity awards. For a brief discussion of our equity incentive plan, see Note 20 within \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Item 8 of this report.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Missouri law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation (as amended, the \u201carticles of incorporation\u201d), our amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cbylaws\u201d) and Missouri law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive and incentivizing prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022our Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022our Board of Directors fixes the number of members on the Board;\n\u2022elimination of the rights of our shareholders to act by written consent (except when such consent is unanimous) and to call shareholder meetings;\n\u2022rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u2022supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022anti-takeover provisions of Missouri law which may prevent us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, or which may deter third parties from acquiring amounts of our common stock above certain thresholds; and\n\u2022limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report, announcements we make about our business, variations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors, market data that is available to subscribers, reports by industry analysts, whether or not we meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow us, industry or market trends, investor perceptions, actions by credit rating agencies, future sales of our common stock or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions, including those that result from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of these factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the Internal Revenue Service or a court may disagree with our tax positions, which may result in adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in our stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be imposed that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to perform a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue an opinion on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting.\nBellRing, as a publicly-traded company, also is separately subject to SOX. As an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, BellRing\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting under SOX. However, if BellRing ceases to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d it will be subject to this requirement under SOX. Further, if BellRing does not satisfy the requirements imposed by SOX, or if its internal control over financial reporting is not effective, it will impact our ability to satisfy our SOX requirements and could impair the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the annual deadline imposed by SOX. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may consequently suffer. In addition, in the event that we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. As of September 30, 2020, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nActions of shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals and other requests from shareholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effecting a change in our management. In the event of such shareholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the\nattention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.", "PERMNO": 13188, "SIC": 2015, "TIC": "POST"}
