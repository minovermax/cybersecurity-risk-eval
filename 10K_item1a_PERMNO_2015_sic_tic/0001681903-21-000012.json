{"cik": "1681903", "company": "ICC Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nIn addition to all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a potential investor should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to purchase our common stock.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\ufeff\nA reduction in our A.M. Best rating could affect our ability to write new business or renew our existing business.\n\ufeff\nRatings assigned by A.M. Best are an important factor influencing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best ratings, which are reviewed at least annually, represent independent opinions of financial strength and ability to meet obligations to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Therefore, our A.M. Best rating should not be relied upon as a basis for an investment decision to purchase our common stock.\n\ufeff\nICC holds a financial strength rating of \u201cB++\u201d (Good) by A.M. Best, the fifth highest rating out of 15 rating classifications. Our upcoming evaluation by A.M. Best will occur on April 28, 2021, with the ratings from this evaluation being released thereafter. Our most recent prior evaluation occurred on April 14, 2020, when A.M. Best assigned its outlook as stable for ICC\u2019s issuer credit rating, and affirmed its financial strength rating of \u201cB++\u201d and affirmed its issuer credit rating of \u201cbbb+\u201d. Financial strength ratings are used by producers and customers as a means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers. Issuer credit ratings is an opinion by A.M. Best of an entity\u2019s ability to meet its ongoing financial obligations. If our financial position deteriorates, we may not maintain our favorable financial strength and issuer credit ratings from A.M. Best. A downgrade of our rating could severely limit or prevent us from writing desirable business or from renewing our existing business. In addition, a downgrade could negatively affect our ability to implement our strategy. See\nItem 1. Business - A.M. Best Rating.\n\ufeff\nOur food and beverage customers have been the target of claims and lawsuits. Proceedings of this nature, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial costs and damages.\n\ufeff\nOccasionally, patrons of our food and beverage industry insured customers file complaints or lawsuits against our insureds alleging a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of their business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws. In addition, certain of our insured customers who serve alcohol are subject to state \u201cdram shop\u201d or similar laws that generally allow a person to sue our customer if that person was injured by a legally intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages by our customer. A number of these lawsuits in the food and beverage industry have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by us on behalf of our insureds.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, states have, from time to time, explored lowering the blood alcohol content levels for criminal statutes related to driving under the influence or similar laws, removing or increasing caps for liability with respect to injuries by a legally intoxicated person, or preventing or limiting rate changes by insurance companies.\n\ufeff\nRegardless of whether any claims against our customers are valid or whether they are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may result in significant liabilities. Defense costs, even for unfounded claims, or a judgment or other liability in excess of our reinsurance limits for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nOur strategy for growing our business may not be profitable.\n\ufeff\nOver the past several years, we have made, and our current plans are to continue to make, investments in our lines of business, and we have increased expenses in order to, among other things, strengthen our product offerings and service capabilities, expand into new geographic areas, improve technology and our operating models, build expertise in our personnel, and expand our distribution capabilities, with the ultimate goal of achieving significant, sustained growth. The ability to achieve significant profitable premium growth in order to earn adequate returns on such investments and expenses, and to grow further without proportionate increases in expenses, is an important part of our current strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful at profitably growing our business, or that we will not alter our current strategy due to changes in our markets or an inability to successfully maintain acceptable margins on new business or for other reasons, in which case premiums written and earned, operating income and net book value could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\n~ 24 ~\nOur investment performance may suffer as a result of adverse capital market developments, which may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.\n\ufeff\nWe invest the premiums we receive from policyholders until cash is needed to pay insured claims or other expenses. We had net realized investment losses of $245,000 and net realized investment gains of $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our investments will be subject to a variety of investment risks, including risks relating to general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity risk and credit risk. An unexpected increase in the volume or severity of claims may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses. If we do not structure the duration of our investments to match our insurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such payments. Investment losses could significantly decrease our asset base and statutory surplus, thereby affecting our ability to conduct business. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Quantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risk.\n\ufeff\nThe geographic distribution of our business exposes us to significant natural disasters, which may negatively affect our financial and operating results.\n\ufeff\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 25.1% of our direct premiums written originated from business written in Illinois, and therefore, we have a greater exposure to catastrophic or other significant natural or man-made losses in that geographic region. The incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. In recent years, changing climate conditions have increased the unpredictability, severity and frequency of tornados, hurricanes, and other storms.\n\ufeff\nStates and regulators from time to time have taken action that has the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage these risks, such as prohibiting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas, or mandating that insurers participate in residual markets. Our ability or willingness to manage our exposure to these risks may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the evolving political environment, or social responsibilities. We may choose to write business in catastrophe-prone geographic areas that we might not otherwise write for strategic purposes, such as improving our access to other underwriting opportunities.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to properly estimate reserves related to tornados and storms can be affected by the inability to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties, and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. These complex factors include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\ndetermining whether damages were caused by flooding versus wind;\n\u00b7\nevaluating general liability and pollution exposures;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of increased demand for products and services necessary to repair or rebuild damaged properties;\n\u00b7\ninfrastructure disruption;\n\u00b7\nfraud;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of mold damage;\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruption costs; and\n\u00b7\nreinsurance collectability.\n\ufeff\nThe estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims are filed and additional information becomes available. This adjustment could reduce income during the period in which the adjustment is made, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nLarge-scale natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Midwest has historically been at a relatively high risk of natural disasters such as tornados, blizzards and flooding. If the Midwest were to experience a large-scale natural disaster, claims incurred would likely increase and our insured\u2019s properties may incur substantial damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\n~ 25 ~\nOur results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry, which may lead to reduced premium volume.\n\ufeff\nResults of companies in the insurance industry, and particularly the property and casualty insurance industry, historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. The industry\u2019s profitability can be affected significantly by:\n\u00b7\nrising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products;\n\u00b7\nvolatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made and natural catastrophes;\n\u00b7\nchanges in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers\u2019 liability develop; and\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of losses.\n\ufeff\nHistorically, the financial performance of the insurance industry has fluctuated in cyclical periods of low premium rates and excess underwriting capacity resulting from increased competition (a so-called \u201csoft market\u201d), followed by periods of high premium rates and a shortage of underwriting capacity resulting from decreased competition (a so-called \u201chard market\u201d). Fluctuations in underwriting capacity, demand and competition, and the impact on our business of the other factors identified above, could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBecause estimating future losses is difficult and uncertain, if our actual losses exceed our loss reserves, our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe maintain reserves to cover amounts we estimate will be needed to pay for insured losses and for the expenses necessary to settle claims. Estimating loss and loss expense reserves is a difficult and complex process involving many variables and subjective judgments. We regularly review our reserve estimate protocols and our overall amount of reserves. We review historical data and consider the impact of various factors such as:\n\u00b7\ntrends in claim frequency and severity;\n\u00b7\ninformation regarding each claim for losses;\n\u00b7\nlegislative enactments, judicial decisions and legal developments regarding damages; and\n\u00b7\ntrends in general economic conditions, including inflation.\n\ufeff\nOur actual losses could exceed our reserves. If we determine that our loss reserves are inadequate, we will have to increase them. This adjustment would reduce income during the period in which the adjustment is made, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Such adjustments to loss reserve estimates are referred to as \u201closs development.\u201d If existing loss reserves exceed the revised estimate, it is referred to as positive loss development. Negative loss development occurs when the revised estimate of expected losses with respect to a calendar year exceed existing loss reserves. For additional information, see Item 1. Business - Loss and Settlement Expense Reserves.\n\ufeff\nIf our reinsurers do not pay our claims in accordance with our reinsurance agreements, we may incur losses.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to loss and credit risk with respect to the reinsurers with whom we deal because buying reinsurance does not relieve us of our liability to policyholders. If our reinsurers are not capable of fulfilling their financial obligations to us, our insurance losses would increase. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we ceded 17.2% of our direct written premiums to our reinsurers. We secure reinsurance coverage from a number of reinsurers. The lowest A.M. Best rating issued to any of our reinsurers is \u201cA\u201d (Excellent), which is the fourth highest of fifteen ratings. See Item 1. Business - Reinsurance.\n\ufeff\n~ 26 ~\nThe property and casualty insurance market in which we operate is highly competitive, which limits our ability to increase premiums for our products and recruit new producers.\n\ufeff\nCompetition in the property and casualty insurance business is based on many factors. These factors include the perceived financial strength of the insurer, premiums charged, policy terms and conditions, services provided, reputation, financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies and the experience of the insurer in the line of insurance to be written. We compete with stock insurance companies, mutual companies, local cooperatives and other underwriting organizations. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and operating resources than we have. Many of the lines of insurance we write are subject to significant price competition. If our competitors price their products aggressively, our ability to grow or renew our business may be adversely affected. We pay producers on a commission basis to produce business. Some of our competitors may offer higher commissions or insurance at lower premium rates through the use of salaried personnel or other distribution methods that do not rely on independent agents. Increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain business and thereby reduce our profits from operations.\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by any loss of business from key producers.\n\ufeff\nOur products are primarily marketed by independent agents. Other insurance companies compete with us for the services and allegiance of these producers. These producers may choose to direct business to our competitors, or may direct less desirable risks to us. We had one producer that was responsible for more than 5% of our direct premiums written. This producer accounted for $4.33 million or approximately 7.3% of our direct premiums written in 2020. No other producer accounted for more than 5% of our 2020 direct premiums written. If we experience a significant decrease in business from, or lose entirely, our largest producers, it would have a material adverse effect on us.\n\ufeff\nOur revenues may fluctuate with our investment results and changes in interest rates.\n\ufeff\nOur investment portfolio contains a significant amount of fixed income securities. The fair values of these invested assets fluctuate depending upon economic conditions, particularly changes in interest rates. We may not be able to prevent or minimize the negative impact of interest rate changes on equity, for unrealized losses. Additionally, unforeseen circumstances may force us to sell certain of our invested assets at a time when their fair values are less than their original cost, resulting in realized capital losses, which would reduce our net earnings.\n\ufeff\nProposals to federally regulate the insurance business could affect our business.\n\ufeff\nCurrently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business. However, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed. These proposals generally would maintain state-based regulation of insurance, but would affect state regulation of certain aspects of the insurance business, including rates, producer and company licensing, and market conduct examinations. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to comply with insurance industry regulations, or if those regulations become more burdensome, we may not be able to operate profitably.\n\ufeff\nWe are regulated by the Illinois Department of Insurance, as well as, to a more limited extent, the federal government and the insurance departments of other states in which we do business. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 25.1% of our direct premiums written originated from business written in Illinois. Therefore, the cancellation or suspension of our license in Illinois, as a result of any failure to comply with the applicable insurance laws and regulations, may negatively impact our operating results.\n\ufeff\nMost insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders and other investors. These regulations relate to, among other things:\n\u00b7\napproval of policy forms and premium rates;\n\u00b7\nstandards of solvency, including establishing requirements for minimum capital and surplus, and for risk-based capital;\n\u00b7\nclassifying assets as admissible for purposes of determining solvency and compliance with minimum capital and surplus requirements;\n\u00b7\nlicensing of insurers and their producers;\n~ 27 ~\n\u00b7\nadvertising and marketing practices;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\n\u00b7\nassessments by guaranty associations and mandatory pooling arrangements;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the ability to pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on transactions between affiliated companies;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;\n\u00b7\nrequiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u00b7\nrequiring certain methods of accounting;\n\u00b7\nperiodic examinations of our operations and finances;\n\u00b7\nclaims practices;\n\u00b7\nprescribing the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed; and\n\u00b7\nrequiring reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes.\n\ufeff\nThe Illinois Department of Insurance also conducts periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and requires the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. Our last examination by the Illinois Department of Insurance was in November 2017.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to manage our exposure to underwriting risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance coverage.\n\ufeff\nReinsurance is the practice of transferring part of an insurance company\u2019s liability and premium under an insurance policy to another insurance company. We use reinsurance arrangements to limit and manage the amount of risk we retain, to stabilize our underwriting results and to increase our underwriting capacity. The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to current market conditions and may vary significantly over time. Any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss. We may be unable to maintain our desired reinsurance coverage or to obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or obtain new coverage, it will be difficult for us to manage our underwriting risks and operate our business profitably.\n\ufeff\nIt is also possible that the losses we experience on risks we have reinsured will exceed the coverage limits on the reinsurance. If the amount of our reinsurance coverage is insufficient, our insurance losses could increase substantially.\n\ufeff\n~ 28 ~\nThe Company relies on information technology and telecommunication systems, and the disruption or failure of these systems, or the compromise of the security of the systems that results in the misuse of confidential information, could materially and adversely affect its business.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of the information technology and telecommunications systems of ICC and its third party vendors. We have established security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations. Our employees participate in ongoing security awareness training focused on the prevention and identification of possible threats. We also have security measures in place which are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions.\n\ufeff\nDespite these efforts, our systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Information technology security threats from user error to cybersecurity attacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. No cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. A sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to process our business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. We could also be subject to fines and penalties from a security breach. The cost to remedy a severe breach could be substantial.\n\ufeff\nWe could be adversely affected by the loss of our existing management or key employees.\n\ufeff\nThe success of our business is dependent, to a large extent, on our ability to attract and retain key employees, in particular our senior officers. Our business may be adversely affected if labor market conditions make it difficult for us to replace our current key officers with individuals having equivalent qualifications and experience at compensation levels competitive for our industry. In particular, because of the shortage of experienced underwriters and claims personnel who have experience or training in the liquor liability sector of the insurance industry, replacing key employees in that line of our business could be challenging. Our key officers include: Arron K. Sutherland, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael R. Smith, our Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, Norman D. Schmeichel, our Vice President - Chief Information Officer, Howard J. Beck, our Vice President - Chief Underwriting Officer, Julia B. Suiter, our Chief Legal Officer, and Kathleen S. Springer, our Chief Human Resources Officer. These key officers have an average of more than 21 years of experience in the property and casualty insurance industry.\n\ufeff\nWe do not have agreements not to compete or employment agreements with our employees, except for our employment agreement with Mr. Sutherland and change in control agreements with certain officers, including Messrs. Smith, Schmeichel, and Beck, and Mesdames Suiter and Springer. Our employment agreement with Mr. Sutherland and change in control agreements have change of control provisions that provide for certain payments and the continuation of certain benefits in the event such officer is terminated without cause or such officer voluntarily quits for good reason after a change in control.\n\ufeff\nLosses resulting from political instability, acts of war or terrorism may negatively affect our financial and operating results.\n\ufeff\nNumerous classes of business are exposed to terrorism related catastrophic risks. The frequency, number and severity of these losses are unpredictable. As a result, we have changed our underwriting protocols to address terrorism and the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance. However, given the uncertainty of the potential threats, we cannot be sure that we have addressed all the possibilities.\nThe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as extended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Acts of 2015 and 2019, is effective through December 31, 2027. Prior to the act, insurance coverage from private insurers for losses (other than workers\u2019 compensation) arising out of acts of terrorism was severely limited. The act provides, among other things, that all licensed insurers must offer coverage on most commercial lines of business for acts of terrorism. Losses arising out of acts of terrorism that are certified as such by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States (in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security) and that exceed $200 million in any year will be reimbursed by the federal government subject to a limit of $100 billion. Each insurance company is responsible for a deductible equal to 20% of its direct earned premiums in the previous calendar year, up to the insurer\u2019s proportionate share of the $100 billion. Our deductible is approximately $11.92 million for 2020. For losses in excess of the deductible, the federal government will reimburse 80% of the insurer\u2019s loss.\n~ 29 ~\nNotwithstanding the protection provided by reinsurance and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, the risk of severe losses to us from acts of terrorism has not been eliminated. Our reinsurance contracts include various limitations or exclusions limiting the reinsurers\u2019 obligation to cover losses caused by acts of terrorism. Accordingly, events constituting acts of terrorism may not be covered by, or may exceed the capacity of, our reinsurance and could adversely affect our business and financial condition\n\ufeff\nWe could be adversely affected by any interruption to our ability to conduct business at our current location.\n\ufeff\nOur business operations could be substantially interrupted by flooding, snow, ice, and other weather-related incidents, or from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorism, or other such events. In such an event, we may not have sufficient redundant facilities to cover a loss or failure in all aspects of our business operations and to restart our business operations in a timely manner. Any damage caused by such a failure or loss may cause interruptions in our business operations that may adversely affect our service levels and business. See Item 1. Business - Technology.\n\ufeff\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n\ufeff\nOur consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAssessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds, second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability.\n\ufeff\nMost states require insurance companies licensed to do business in their state to participate in guaranty funds, which require the insurance companies to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies. These obligations are funded by assessments, which are expected to continue in the future. State guaranty associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurance companies in the state based on their proportionate share of premiums written in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies are engaged. Accordingly, the assessments levied on us may increase as we increase our written premiums. Some states also have laws that establish second injury funds to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries. These funds are supported by either assessments or premium surcharges based on incurred losses. See Item 1. Business - Regulation.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, as a condition to conducting business in some states, insurance companies are required to participate in residual market programs to provide insurance to those who cannot procure coverage from an insurance carrier on a negotiated basis. Insurance companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by, among other things, participating in a reinsurance pool where the results of all policies provided through the pool are shared by the participating insurance companies. Although we price our insurance to account for our potential obligations under these pooling arrangements, we may not be able to accurately estimate our liability for these obligations. Accordingly, mandatory pooling arrangements may cause a decrease in our profits. At December 31, 2020, we participated in mandatory pooling arrangements in four states. As we write policies in new states that have mandatory pooling arrangements, we will be required to participate in additional pooling arrangements. Further, the impairment, insolvency or failure of other insurance companies in these pooling arrangements would likely increase the liability for other members in the pool. The effect of assessments and premium surcharges or increases in such assessments or surcharges could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\ufeff\nOur operations in Mexico expose us to additional risks, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company utilizes resources in Mexico through operations at Estrella. These operations expose us to additional risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company is paid and is billed for services in U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate to the Mexican Peso. Any changes to the exchange rate could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\ufeff\n~ 30 ~\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as applicable to emerging growth companies, which requires management to assess the effectiveness of internal controls. As described in Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take will remediate any material weaknesses identified or that we may identify in the future, or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial process and reporting in the future.\n\ufeff\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and current SEC regulations, we are required to prepare assessments regarding internal control over financial reporting and furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment or complete our Section 404 certifications could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\n\ufeff\nAny failure to complete our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, to remediate any material weaknesses or to implement new or improved controls could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations of our internal controls and, in the case of a failure to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, would adversely affect the annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nRisk Factors Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\ufeff\nA small number of shareholders collectively own a substantial portion of our common stock and voting power, and, because of restrictions on their ability to buy or sell our shares, our public float will be limited.\n\ufeff\nCollectively, the three investors who purchased shares from us pursuant to investment agreements (the Clinton-Flood Purchasers, Rock Island Investors, LLC, and Tuscarora Wayne) own or exercise voting and investment control of 1.2 million of our shares, or 36.5% of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to their respective purchase agreement, each investor has agreed to, among other things, vote as recommended by our board of directors (subject to limited exceptions), agree to a standstill provision, including from purchasing shares of our common stock except as provided by a contractual preemptive right, for up to seven years, agreed to restrictions on their respective ability to sell their shares of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nIf and for so long as an investor beneficially owns two percent (2.0%) or more of the shares of our common stock and a standstill termination event has not occurred, the investor shall generally vote and cause to be voted all shares of common stock beneficially owned by such investor (a) for persons nominated and recommended by ICC Holdings\u2019 Board of Directors for election as directors of ICC Holdings\u2019 Board of Directors and against any person nominated for election as a director by any other person or entity, and (b) as directed or recommended by ICC Holdings\u2019 Board of Directors with respect to any proposal presented at any meeting of ICC Holdings\u2019 shareholders, including, but not limited to (i) the entire slate of directors recommended for election by the ICC Holdings\u2019 Board of Directors to the shareholders of ICC Holdings at any meeting of ICC Holdings\u2019 shareholders at which any directors are elected, (ii) any shareholder proposal submitted for a vote at any meeting of ICC Holdings\u2019 shareholders, and (iii) any proposal submitted by ICC Holdings for a vote at any meeting of ICC Holdings\u2019 shareholders relating (A) to the appointment of ICC Holdings\u2019 accountants, or (B) an equity compensation plan of ICC Holdings and/or any material revisions thereto. This provision may have the effect of entrenching our board of directors and management team and may deprive a shareholder of the opportunity to sell shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. As a result, other shareholders may be prevented from affecting matters involving our company, including:\n\u00b7\nthe composition of our board of directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers;\n\u00b7\nany determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations;\n\u00b7\nour acquisition or disposition of assets; and\n\u00b7\nour corporate financing activities.\n\ufeff\n~ 31 ~\nFurthermore, this concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company that is controlled by a small number of shareholders.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, these investors are restricted from buying or selling shares of our common stock pursuant to their respective investment agreements and, in some cases, by restrictions under applicable securities laws. For three years following the closing, each of the investors are generally prohibited from selling any shares of our common stock. Effective March 2020, the third anniversary of the closing date, subject to our right of first refusal in favor of us, each investor is authorized to sell no more than six and one-quarter percent (6-1/4%) of the number of shares purchased at the closing of the offering every ninety days. Upon the occurrence of a death or disability of R. Kevin Clinton, no more than six and one-quarter percent (6-1/4%) of the number of shares purchased at the closing of the offering by R. Kevin Clinton and certain other purchasers who together purchased 800,000 shares of our common stock every ninety days by their trusts, estate or spouse could be sold beginning, unless an earlier date has been approved by a majority of the members of our board of directors other than R. Kevin Clinton or his replacement on our board of directors, (a) one year following such occurrence, if such event occurs during the first year following the closing date, (b) six months following such occurrence, if such event occurs during the second year following the closing date, or (c) following such occurrence, if such event occurs during the third year following the closing date. Until the expiration of the standstill provision discussed below, each investor is restricted from buying any shares of our common stock other than those acquired pursuant to their respective investment agreements and pursuant to their respective preemptive right thereunder. As a result, the liquidity of our common stock relative to what it would have been had these shares been purchased by other investors may be reduced.\n\ufeff\nFor so long as an investor beneficially owns two percent (2.0%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, these standstill provisions will continue until the earliest of (a) the seventh anniversary of the closing of the offering, or (b) the date on which ICC Holdings includes a balance sheet in a filing with the SEC in which its \u201cadjusted shareholders\u2019 equity\u201d at the end of such fiscal quarter is less than 85% of the \u201cstarting shareholders\u2019 equity\u201d. We received gross proceeds of $29.1 million in the offering, using information as of December 31, 2020 as the starting shareholders\u2019 equity, the adjusted shareholders equity would have to be $9.5 million lower in order to trigger a termination of the standstill provisions. Following the expiration of the standstill and other provisions, if these investors retain their ownership levels, such investors together may be able to exhibit significant control over us and our management and will have significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including future amendments to our amended and restated articles of incorporation or other significant or extraordinary transactions. The interests of these investors may differ from the interests of our other shareholders with respect to certain matters.\n\ufeff\nOur Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) and stock-based incentive plan will increase our costs, which will reduce our income.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2020, our ESOP holds 10.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock, with such shares acquired with funds borrowed from us prior to the expiration of our IPO. The cost of acquiring the shares of common stock for the ESOP, and therefore the amount of the loan, was $3.5 million. The loan will be repaid over a fifteen year period. We record employee stock ownership plan expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the shares of common stock committed to be released to employees under the ESOP for each year. If shares of our common stock appreciate in value over time, compensation expense relating to the employee stock ownership plan will increase.\n\ufeff\nOur board of directors adopted a stock-based incentive plan that was submitted to, and approved by, our shareholders in 2017. Under this plan, we may award participants restricted shares of our common stock, restricted stock units denominated in shares of our common stock, or options to purchase shares of our common stock. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards will be made at no cost to the participants. Restricted stock units are payable in shares of common stock or in cash in the discretion of the compensation committee. The number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards (to the extent that such restricted stock unit awards are not paid in cash) or upon exercise of stock option awards under the stock-based incentive plan may not exceed 10% and 4%, respectively, of the total number of shares sold in the offering.\n\ufeff\nThe costs associated with the grant of restricted stock awarded under the stock-based incentive plan will be recognized and expensed over the vesting period of the award at the fair market value of the shares on the date they are awarded. The costs associated with the grant of restricted stock unit awards to be settled in cash will similarly be recognized and expensed over their vesting period at the fair market value of the shares on the date they are awarded. However, unlike awards of restricted stock, the fair market value will be remeasured on a quarterly basis until the award vests or is otherwise settled. Therefore, in addition to reducing our net earnings by recording this compensation and benefit expense, increases in our stock price will increase this expense for restricted stock unit awards settled in cash, thereby further reducing our net earnings.\n\ufeff\n~ 32 ~\nFinally, accounting rules require companies to recognize as compensation expense the award-date fair value of stock options. This compensation expense will be recognized over the appropriate service period. When we record an expense for the award of options using the fair value method, we will incur significant compensation and benefits expense, which will reduce our net earnings.\n\ufeff\nThe valuation of our common stock in the initial public offering is not necessarily indicative of the future price of our common stock, and the price of our common stock may decline.\n\ufeff\nThere can be no assurance that shares of our common stock will be able to be sold in the market at or above the $10.00 per share initial offering price in the future. The final aggregate purchase price of our common stock in the offering was based upon an independent appraisal. The appraisal is not intended, and should not be construed, as a recommendation of any kind as to the advisability of purchasing shares of common stock. The valuation is based on estimates of a number of matters, all of which are subject to change from time to time. See \u201cThe Conversion and Offering - The Valuation\u201d in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on February 13, 2017 for the factors considered by Feldman Financial in determining the appraisal.\n\ufeff\nThe price of shares of our common stock may decline for many reasons, some of which are beyond our control, including among others:\n\u00b7\nCapital market conditions generally;\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in expectations as to our future results of operations, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by third parties of claims against us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in law and regulation;\n\u00b7\nresults of operations that vary from those expected by investors; and\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of shares of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the stock market routinely experiences substantial price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. As a result, the trading price of shares of our common stock may be below the initial public offering price, and a shareholder may not be able to sell shares at or above the price paid to purchase them.\n\ufeff\nStatutory provisions and our articles and bylaws may discourage takeover attempts on the Company that shareholders may believe are in their best interests or that might result in a substantial profit to them.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to provisions of Pennsylvania corporate law and Illinois insurance law that hinder a change of control. Illinois law requires the Illinois Department of Insurance\u2019s prior approval of a change of control of an insurance holding company. Under Illinois law, the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of an insurer or its holding company is presumed to be a change in control. Approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance may be withheld even if the transaction would be in the shareholders\u2019 best interest if the Illinois Department of Insurance determines that the transaction would be detrimental to policyholders.\n\ufeff\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that may discourage a change in control. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\na prohibition on a person, including a group acting in concert, from acquiring voting control of more than 10% of our outstanding stock without prior approval of the board of directors;\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors divided into three classes serving for successive terms of three years each;\n\u00b7\nthe prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that nominations for the election of directors made by shareholders and any shareholder proposals for inclusion on the agenda at any annual meeting must be made by notice (in writing) delivered or mailed to us not less than 90 days prior to the meeting;\n\u00b7\nthe prohibition of shareholders\u2019 action without a meeting and of shareholders\u2019 right to call a special meeting;\n\u00b7\nunless otherwise waived by the board of directors, to be elected as a director, a person must be a shareholder of ICC Holdings, Inc. for the lesser of one year or the time that has elapsed since the completion of the conversion;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement imposing a mandatory tender offering requirement on a shareholder that has a combined voting power of 25% or more of the votes that our shareholders are entitled to cast;\n~ 33 ~\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that certain provisions of our articles of incorporation can only be amended by an affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to cast at least 80% of all votes that shareholders are entitled to cast, unless approved by an affirmative vote of at least 80% of the members of the board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that certain provisions of our bylaws can only be amended by an affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to cast at least 66 2/3%, or in certain cases 80%, of all votes that shareholders are entitled to cast.\n\ufeff\nThese provisions may serve to entrench management and may discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder may consider to be in his or her best interest or in which the shareholder would receive a substantial premium over the current market price. These provisions may make it extremely difficult for any one person, entity or group of affiliated persons or entities to acquire voting control of the Company, with the result that it may be extremely difficult to bring about a change in the board of directors or management. Some of these provisions also may perpetuate present management because of the additional time required to cause a change in the control of the board. Other provisions make it difficult for shareholders owning less than a majority of the voting stock to be able to elect even a single director.\n\ufeff\nIf ICC is not sufficiently profitable, our ability to pay dividends will be limited.\n\ufeff\nWe are a separate entity with no operations of our own other than holding the stock of ICC; ICC Realty, LLC; Beverage Insurance Agency, Inc; and Estrella Innovative Solutions, Inc. We depend primarily on dividends paid by ICC, distributions from ICC Realty, LLC, and any proceeds from the offering that are not contributed to ICC to pay the debt service on our existing loans and to provide funds for the payment of dividends. We will receive dividends only after all of ICC\u2019s obligations and regulatory requirements with the Illinois Department of Insurance have been satisfied. During any twelve-month period, the amount of dividends paid by ICC to us, without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance, may not exceed the greater of 10% of ICC\u2019s surplus as regards policyholders as reported on its most recent annual statement filed with the Illinois Department of Insurance or ICC\u2019s statutory net income as reported on such statement. We presently do not intend to pay dividends to our shareholders. If ICC is not sufficiently profitable, our ability to pay dividends in the future will be limited.\n\ufeff\nOngoing compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in higher operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWith the completion of our initial public offering, we are now subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, insider trading prohibitions and other obligations imposed under the Securities Exchange Act. In addition, certain of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act became applicable to us at the completion of the offering. Compliance with these requirements will increase our legal, accounting and other compliance costs and the cost of directors and officer\u2019s liability insurance, and will require management to devote substantial time and effort to ensure initial and ongoing compliance with these obligations. A key component of compliance under the Exchange Act is to produce quarterly and annual financial reports within prescribed time periods after the close of our fiscal year and each fiscal quarter. Historically, we have not been required to prepare such financial reports within these time periods. Failure to satisfy these reporting requirements may result in delisting of our common stock by the NASDAQ Capital Market, and inquiries from or sanctions by the SEC. Moreover, the provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires public companies to review and report on the adequacy of their internal controls over financial reporting may be applicable to us in 2022. We expect these rules, regulations and requirements to significantly increase our accounting, legal, compliance and other costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also may need to hire additional accounting, legal, compliance and administrative staff with experience working for public companies. We may be unable to hire such additional staff on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. In addition, such additional staff may not be able to provide such services at levels sufficient to comply with these requirements. Moreover, the rules that became applicable to us as a public company could make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers. We also anticipate that these rules will make it more expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain such coverage. If we fail to predict these costs accurately or to manage these costs effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nOur high price-to-earnings ratio may cause our stock to trade at less than $10 per share in the secondary market obtained in the offering.\n\ufeff\nBecause of our relatively low returns on equity in recent reporting periods, the price-to-earnings ratio of our shares may be substantially higher than our peers. This may result in our shares trading in the secondary market at less than the $10 per share offering price.\n\ufeff\n~ 34 ~\nIf we fail to maintain the necessary requirements to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the price and liquidity of our stock may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nIn order to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we must meet certain minimum requirements for our shareholders\u2019 equity, net earnings, the market value and number of publicly held shares, the number of shareholders, and the market price of our stock. In addition, we must have up to four market makers making a market in our stock under certain continued listing standards. Delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market may adversely affect the market price for our stock and reduce the liquidity of our common stock, and therefore, make it more difficult for a shareholder to sell our stock. For more information regarding the reduced liquidity as a result of our agreements with the investors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock - A small number of shareholders will collectively own a substantial portion of our common stock and voting power, and, because of restrictions on their ability to buy or sell our shares, our public float will be limited.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the U.S. and global economy; disrupted U.S. and global supply chains; lowered equity market valuations; created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets; contributed to a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities; resulted in ratings downgrades, credit deterioration, and defaults in many industries; increased demands on capital and liquidity; and increased unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses, especially bars and restaurants, and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities, including those in our footprint. The pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, to recognize losses in our investment portfolios and increases in our allowance for losses. Furthermore, the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our financial assets. Sustained adverse effects may also increase our cost of capital, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital and surplus, or result in downgrades in our A.M. Best ratings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, colleagues, counterparties and service providers, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\n\ufeff\nGovernmental authorities have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown, and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of insurance premium payments and the reduction in interest rates to near zero, may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. We also may become subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that retroactively mandates coverage for losses that our insurance policies were not intended or priced to cover, including business interruption claims, despite terms included in our policies to preclude coverage or that creates presumptions of compensability not otherwise present (including for example in workers\u2019 compensations exposures). Regulatory requirements could also impact pricing, risk selection and our rights and obligations with respect to our policies and insureds, including our ability to cancel policies, collect premiums, or requiring us to refund premiums in a manner not otherwise required. We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions. These potential exposures include direct claims relating to COVID-19 (e.g., business interruption following a shelter in place order) and indirect exposures arising from an economic downturn.\n\ufeff\nThe length of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the measures put in place to address it are unknown. Until the effects of the pandemic subside, we could experience reduced revenues in our businesses. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n~ 35 ~", "PERMNO": 16633, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "ICCH"}
