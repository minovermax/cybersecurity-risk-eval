{"cik": "1029730", "company": "LADENBURG THALMANN FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider all of the risks described below regarding our company. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nDamage to our reputation could adversely impact our business.\nMaintaining our reputation is critical to our ability to attract and retain financial advisors, clients and employees, and our failure, or perceived failure, to appropriately operate our business or deal with matters that give rise to reputational risk may materially and adversely harm our business, prospects and results of operations.\nThose matters giving rise to reputational risk include the risks discussed in this Item 1A, as well as appropriately dealing with legal and regulatory requirements, anti-money-laundering practices, privacy, record keeping, and sales and trading practices, as well as our proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity, and market risks inherent in financial products. Also, our inability to sell securities that we have underwritten on expected terms, including anticipated prices, could result in reputational damage that results in our loss of investment banking business, which would adversely impact our Ladenburg segment. Our failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or our failure or perceived failure to treat clients fairly, could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Further, negative publicity regarding us or our financial advisors, whether or not true, may be detrimental to our business.\nChanging conditions in financial markets and the economy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results have been adversely affected by turmoil in the financial markets in the past and may again be impacted in the future. As a financial services firm, changes in the financial markets or economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world could materially adversely affect our business in many ways, including the following:\n\u2022\na market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads;\n\u2022\nlow interest rates adversely impact service fee revenues received from our clearing firms and other cash sweep programs;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the market could lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by portfolio managers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors;\n\u2022\nunfavorable financial or economic conditions could reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, financial advisory and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory and underwriting or placement fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and therefore could be adversely affected by unfavorable financial or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nincreases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the market could lead to losses from principal transactions. To the extent that we own assets, i.e., have long positions, a downturn in the market could result in losses from a decline in the value of those long positions. Conversely, to the extent that we have sold assets that we do not own, i.e., have short positions, an upturn in the market could expose us to potentially unlimited losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market; and\n\u2022\nnew or increased taxes on compensation payments such as bonuses or securities transactions may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have incurred, and may again incur, losses.\nWe incurred losses in 2019, 2018, 2017 and in various prior years, some of which were significant. We cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability or have positive cash flow on either a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to achieve and sustain our profitability, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and preferred stock outstanding, which limits cash flow available for operations and may impair our ability to obtain additional financing.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total debt was approximately $315 million and we had 17,401,282 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of approximately $435 million. Our substantial amount of indebtedness and preferred stock outstanding:\n\u2022\nrequires us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to the payment of debt service and dividends, resulting in less cash available for operations and other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimits our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, regulatory capital requirements, acquisitions or general corporate purposes.\nOur substantial indebtedness also increases our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in general economic conditions. Our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance. Also, there can be no assurance that we will satisfy the requirements for forgiveness of our forgivable loans from our principal clearing firm. Our future operating performance is subject to many factors, including economic, financial and competitive factors, which may be beyond our control.\nAs a result, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow, and future sales of equity or debt securities in public or private transactions may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and results of operations.\nWe and Securities America Financial Corporation are guarantors of certain indebtedness incurred by Advisor Group, and the instruments governing such indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and Securities America Financial Corporation.\nFollowing the Merger, we and Securities America Financial Corporation agreed to guarantee approximately $2.413 billion of indebtedness of Advisor Group, consisting of (i) $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2028, (ii) $413 million in aggregate principal amount of 10.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 and (iii) $1.5 billion pursuant to Advisor Group's senior secured credit facilities. The instruments governing such indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and Securities America Financial Corporation. These restrictions will limit our ability, subject to certain exceptions, to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate; and\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets.\nIn addition, the terms of the instruments governing the outstanding 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and 10.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 and Advisor Group\u2019s senior secured credit facilities, and our guarantees of the obligations thereunder, may place restrictions under certain circumstances on our ability to pay principal and interest on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, the 6.5% Senior Notes, 7% Senior Notes, 7.25% Senior Notes and 7.75% Senior Notes.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we or Advisor Group may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we or Advisor Group will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in Advisor Group or us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. In addition, the obligations under the senior secured credit facilities and 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 are secured by substantially all of our and Securities America Financial Corporation's assets.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain financial advisors and professional employees.\nFrom time to time, financial advisors and individuals we employ choose to leave our company to pursue other opportunities. We have experienced losses of financial advisors and trading and investment banking professionals in the past, and competition for key personnel remains intense. We cannot assure you that the loss of financial advisors and key personnel will not occur in the future. We expend significant resources in recruiting, training and retaining our financial advisors. The loss of a key financial advisor, trading or investment banking professional, or broker-dealer executive, particularly a senior banking professional or executive with significant industry contacts, or the failure to recruit productive financial advisors could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Also, difficultly in recruiting young advisors, due to the low number of persons entering our industry, combined with the high average age of our existing financial advisors, may adversely impact our ability to retain client assets and our financial results.\nFurther, if we fail to replace our advisors who retire or fail to assist our retiring advisors with transitioning their practices to existing advisors, or if advisor migration away from wire houses and to independent channels decreases or slows, our business may suffer.\nMisconduct by our employees and independent financial advisors, who operate in a decentralized environment, is difficult to detect and deter and could harm our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nMisconduct by our employees and independent financial advisors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm.\nMisconduct could include:\n\u2022\nrecommending transactions that are not suitable for the client or in the client\u2019s best interests;\n\u2022\nengaging in fraudulent or otherwise improper activity;\n\u2022\nbinding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits;\n\u2022\nhiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities, resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses;\n\u2022\nimproperly using or disclosing confidential information;\n\u2022\nfailure, whether negligent or intentional, to effect securities transactions on behalf of clients;\n\u2022\nfailure to perform reasonable diligence on a security, product or strategy;\n\u2022\nfailure to supervise a financial advisor;\n\u2022\nfailure to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information;\n\u2022\nengaging in unauthorized or excessive trading to the detriment of clients;\n\u2022\nengaging in improper transactions with clients; or\n\u2022\notherwise not complying with laws or our control procedures.\nWe cannot always deter misconduct by our employees and independent financial advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Also, our failure to properly investigate new and existing financial advisors may subject us to additional risks and liabilities.\nPrevention and detection among our independent financial advisors, who are not employees of our company and tend to be located in small, decentralized offices, present additional challenges. Misconduct by our employees and independent financial advisors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified risks or an unanticipated level of risk.\nThe policies and procedures we employ to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective. Some methods of risk management are based on historical behavior. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than indicated historically. Other risk management methods depend on our management's evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible. This information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will effectively and accurately record and verify this information. Also, we face additional risk management challenges because many of our independent financial advisors work in small, decentralized offices.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational and legal reporting systems. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of our ability to manage risk exposure can never be completely or accurately predicted or fully assured. For example, unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, regardless of our risk management policies and procedures.\nPoor performance of the investment products and services recommended or sold to our clients or competitive pressures on pricing of such products and services may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur advisors' clients control their assets maintained with us. These clients can terminate their relationships, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, financial market performance, competitive pricing and personal client liquidity needs. Poor performance of the investment products and services recommended or sold to such clients relative to the performance of other products available in the market or the performance of other investment management firms tends to result in the loss of accounts. Competitive pricing, including from robo-advisors and higher deposit rates on cash deposits, could adversely impact our business. The decrease in revenue that could result from such an event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties integrating our business with Advisor Group and may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our Merger with Advisor Group will depend, to a large extent, on the integration of our business with Advisor Group. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with the business practices and operations of Advisor Group. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of clients, loss of advisors and diversion of the attention of our management and employees.\nIn addition, even if the operations of our business and the business of Advisor Group are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or cash flows that are expected, and the combined company will also be subject to additional risks that could impact future earnings. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all, and the costs to achieve such synergies may be more than anticipated. In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of advisors and other key employees, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, which adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with existing clients, advisors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nSystems failures could significantly disrupt our business and subject us to losses, litigation and regulatory actions.\nOur business depends on our and our clearing firms\u2019 ability to process, on a daily basis, many transactions across numerous and diverse markets and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. We rely heavily on our communications and financial, accounting and other data processing systems, including systems we maintain and systems provided by our clearing brokers and service providers. We face operational risk arising from mistakes made in the confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted.\nIf any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention and fines or reputational damage. Any failure or interruption of our systems, the systems of our clearing brokers, or third-party trading systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Also, our clearing brokers provide our principal disaster recovery system. We also are implementing new technology platforms and failures in connection with such implementation may cause disruption to our operations, which could result in liability and reputational damage. We cannot assure you that we or our clearing brokers will not suffer any systems failures or interruption, including ones caused by earthquake, fire, other natural disasters, power or telecommunications failure, act of God, act of war, cyberattacks, unauthorized access, viruses, human error, terrorism, or otherwise, or that our, or our clearing brokers', back-up procedures and capabilities in the event of any such failure or interruption will be adequate.\nOur operational systems and networks have been, and will continue to be, subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client information, loss of our proprietary information, damage to our reputation, additional costs to us, regulatory penalties and other adverse impacts.\nThe secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations. A portion of our business is conducted through the Internet, mobile devices and our internal computer systems. We rely on technology to provide the security necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet. Maintaining the integrity of these systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations, including the retention of our advisors and their clients, and to the protection of our proprietary information and client information.\nWe rely on our advisors and employees to comply with our policies and procedures to safeguard confidential data. The failure of our advisors and employees to comply with such policies and procedures could result in the loss or wrongful use of their clients\u2019 confidential information or other sensitive information. The increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks. Also, even if we and our advisors comply with our policies and procedures, persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our confidential information or the confidential information of our advisors' clients, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations and we may not be able to detect such breaches for an extended period of time. During such time, we may not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material breaches of, or interference with, our systems and networks; however, we routinely encounter and address such threats. Our experiences with cybersecurity and technology threats have included phishing scams, introductions of malware, attempts at electronic break-ins and unauthorized payment requests. Any such breaches or interference by third parties or by our advisors or employees that may occur in the future and the failure of our controls and procedures to detect or prevent such breaches or interference could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, human error, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, or other malicious code and other events that could impact the security, reliability, and availability of our systems. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our own, our advisors\u2019 or their clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed, stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our own, our advisors\u2019 or their clients\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and we may be subject to litigation, regulatory sanctions and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain.\nDespite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity and technology risks, we cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions, unauthorized access to, or the disclosure or loss of, our own, our advisors\u2019 or their clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential or other information. This in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, loss of advisors or client assets or other damage to our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, this insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. Also, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks and the adoption and maintenance of appropriate security measures. We also may be subject to litigation and regulatory sanctions.\nWe could also suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business.\nWe rely on clearing brokers and the termination of our clearing agreements could disrupt our business.\nEach of Triad, Investacorp, KMS, and Ladenburg uses one principal clearing broker to process securities transactions and maintain customer accounts on a fee basis. Securities America and SSN use two clearing brokers to perform the same functions. Each clearing broker also provides billing services, extends credit and provides for control and receipt, custody and delivery of securities. Each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries depends on the operational capacity and ability of its clearing broker for the orderly processing of transactions. By engaging the processing services of a clearing firm, each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries is exempt from some capital reserve requirements and other regulatory requirements imposed by federal and state securities laws. If these clearing agreements were terminated for any reason, we would be forced to find alternative clearing arrangements.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to find alternative clearing arrangements on acceptable terms to us or at all. Also, the loss of a clearing firm could hamper the ability of our subsidiaries to recruit and retain their respective independent financial advisors.\nOur business depends on commissions and fees generated from the distribution of financial products, and adverse changes in the structure or amount of fees or marketing allowances paid by the sponsors of these products could materially adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and results of operations.\nWe generate an important portion of our revenues from commissions and fees related to the distribution of financial products, such as mutual funds and variable and fixed annuities, by our independent financial advisors, and to a lesser extent, Ladenburg\u2019s financial advisors. Changes in the structure or amount of the fees or marketing allowances paid by the sponsors of these products could materially adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and results of operations.\nAlso, regulatory agencies and other industry participants have suggested that Rule 12b-1 distribution fees in the mutual fund industry should be reconsidered and, potentially, reduced or eliminated. The DOL, which promulgates rules related to retirement plans, has implemented rules that restrict commissions and fees on qualified retirement accounts, including IRAs, which had a negative effect on our financial results. Any further reduction or restructuring of Rule 12b-1 distribution fees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In February 2018, the SEC announced a Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative, which demonstrates the increased focus on these fees. Further, as a result of increased regulatory focus on minimizing cost differences among mutual fund share classes offered to clients, certain of our subsidiaries have, and may, rebate certain fees to clients and could be subject to additional regulatory actions.\nDecreases in client assets or assets under management may decrease our revenues.\nThe results of operations of our independent advisory and brokerage subsidiaries depend on their level of assets under management and client assets. Assets under management balances are impacted by both the flow of client assets in and out of accounts and changes in market values. Poor investment performance by financial products and financial advisors could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors. A reduction in client assets or assets under management may cause our revenues to decline.\nOur clearing firms extend credit to our clients and we are liable if the clients do not pay.\nEach of our broker-dealer subsidiaries permits its clients to purchase securities on a margin basis or sell securities short, which means that the applicable clearing firm extends the client credit that is secured by cash and securities in the client\u2019s account. Market conditions, general economic conditions and issues affecting the particular securities held by a client, among other factors, could cause the value of the collateral held by the clearing firm to fall below the amount borrowed by the client. If margin requirements are not sufficient to cover losses, the clearing broker sells or buys securities at prevailing market prices, and may incur losses to satisfy client obligations. Each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify its clearing brokers for losses they may incur while extending credit to its clients.\nSignificant interest rate changes, reductions in cash balances in our cash sweep programs, or the termination of our cash sweep agreements could affect our profitability and financial condition.\nOur revenues are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in fees payable to us from banks participating in cash sweep programs, which are based on prevailing interest rates. Our revenues from our sweep programs are negatively impacted by periods of low interest rates and by clients moving assets out of our cash sweep programs. Revenue from our cash sweep programs also depends on our ability to manage the terms of both our agreements with banks participating in our programs and program fees and interest rates payable to clients.\nIf our contracts with participants in cash sweep programs are terminated or expire, we may not be able to obtain contracts on similar terms, which would decrease our revenue and profitability. Also, decreases in interest rates or clients moving assets out of our cash sweep programs would decrease our revenue and profitability. We may also be limited in the amount we can reduce interest rates payable to clients in cash sweep programs and still offer a competitive return. A sustained low interest rate environment such as the current environment may negatively impact our ability to negotiate contracts on comparable terms.\nA loss of our sponsorship and marketing relationships with financial product manufacturers could harm our relationship with our advisors and affect our financial condition.\nWe have sponsorship and marketing agreements with certain product manufacturers, including manufacturers of mutual funds, ETFs, and fixed and variable annuity products. If these manufacturers do not renew or decide to terminate these agreements, our ability to serve our advisors and our profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business.\nWe expect the growth of our business to come primarily from organic growth, recruiting and through acquisitions. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that our financial controls, the level and knowledge of our personnel, our operational abilities, our legal and compliance controls and our other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and our growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, as we acquire new businesses, we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems into ours, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business, cash flows and results of operations.\nEven if we successfully complete acquisitions, we may be adversely affected if the acquired firms do not perform as expected. The firms we acquire may perform below expectations after the acquisition for various reasons, including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the products in which a firm specializes, the loss of key clients, employees and/or financial advisors after the acquisition closing, general economic factors and the cultural incompatibility of an acquired firm\u2019s management team with us. The failure of firms to perform as expected at the time of acquisition may have an adverse effect on our earnings and revenue growth rates, and may result in impairment charges and/or generate losses or charges to earnings.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war or other external events could affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, including earthquakes, fires, floods, tornadoes, blackouts and pandemic or other contagious outbreaks, or man-made disasters, such as terrorism and acts of war, could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Such disasters may damage our facilities and prevent our employees and financial advisors from performing their roles. Although we have established a disaster recovery plan, there is no guarantee that we would be able to operate without disruption in the event any such disaster was to occur. In addition, the emergence of a pandemic or contagious outbreak, such as the recent coronavirus outbreak, could lead to travel restrictions or other operational difficulties that could impair our ability to conduct our business. A pandemic or outbreak may also have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial condition, including due to reduced revenue from conference attendance, reduced commissions resulting from client's lowering their level of trading activity, or reduced advisory fees resulting from a sell-off in the financial markets.\nWe may be unable to underwrite securities due to capital limits.\nFrom time to time, our underwriting activities may require that we temporarily receive an infusion of capital for regulatory purposes. This is predicated on the amount of Ladenburg's commitment for each underwriting. In the past, we entered into temporary subordinated loan arrangements with our shareholders or a clearing firm. Should we no longer be able to receive such funding from these sources, and if there are no other viable sources available, it would have an adverse impact on our ability to underwrite offerings, generate profits, recruit financial consultants and retain existing customers.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Industry\nCredit risk exposes us to losses caused by third parties\u2019 financial or other problems.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations.\nThese parties include:\n\u2022\ntrading counterparties;\n\u2022\ncustomers;\n\u2022\nclearing agents;\n\u2022\nother broker-dealers;\n\u2022\nexchanges;\n\u2022\nclearing houses; and\n\u2022\nother financial intermediaries as well as issuers whose securities we hold.\nThese parties may default on their obligations owed to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. This risk may arise, for example, from:\n\u2022\nholding securities of third parties;\n\u2022\nexecuting securities trades that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries; and\n\u2022\nextending credit to clients through bridge or margin loans or other arrangements.\nSignificant failures by third parties to perform their obligations owed to us could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and perhaps our ability to borrow in the credit markets.\nIntense competition from existing and new entities may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue and intensify in the future. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors also have greater name recognition and a larger base of financial advisors and clients. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. They may also be able to undertake more extensive marketing activities, offer more attractive terms to clients and financial advisors, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors and competitive pressures faced by us may harm our business and may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nErrors and omissions claims may negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries are subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business resulting from alleged and actual errors and omissions in effecting securities transactions, rendering investment advice and placing insurance. These activities involve substantial amounts of money. Since errors and omissions claims against our subsidiaries or their financial advisors may allege liability for all or part of the amounts in question, claimants may seek large damage awards. These claims can involve significant defense costs. Errors and omissions could include, for example, failure, whether negligently or intentionally, to effect securities transactions on behalf of clients, to choose suitable investments for any particular client, to supervise a financial advisor or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information. It is not always possible to prevent or detect errors and omissions, and the precautions our subsidiaries take may not be effective in all cases. Our liability for significant and successful errors and omissions claims may materially and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various risks associated with the securities industry, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are subject to uncertainties that are common in the securities industry. These uncertainties include:\n\u2022\nthe volatility of domestic and international financial, bond and stock markets;\n\u2022\nextensive governmental regulation;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nintense competition;\n\u2022\npoor performance of investment products our advisors recommend or sell;\n\u2022\nsubstantial fluctuations in the volume and price level of securities; and\n\u2022\ndependence on the solvency of various third parties.\nAs a result, revenues and earnings may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. In periods of low retail and institutional brokerage volume and reduced investment banking activity, profitability is impaired because certain expenses remain relatively fixed.\nWe are smaller and have less capital than many of our competitors in the securities industry. In the event of a market downturn, our business could be adversely affected in many ways. Our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances and, if we are unable to reduce expenses at the same pace, our profit margins would erode.\nLegal liability may harm our business.\nMany aspects of our business subject us to substantial risks of liability to customers and to regulatory enforcement proceedings by state and federal regulators. We face significant legal risks in our businesses and, in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing. In the normal course of business, our operating subsidiaries have been, and continue to be, the subject of numerous civil actions, regulatory proceedings and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our activities as a broker-dealer, as an employer or as a result of other business activities.\nDissatisfied clients often make claims against securities firms and their brokers and investment advisers for, among others, negligence, fraud, unauthorized trading, suitability, churning, failure to conduct adequate due diligence on products offered, failure to address issues arising from product due diligence, failure to supervise, breach of fiduciary duty, employee errors, intentional misconduct, unauthorized transactions, improper recruiting activity, and failures in the processing of securities transactions. These types of claims expose us to the risk of significant loss. Also, an underwriter, such as Ladenburg, is exposed to substantial liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws, and court decisions, including decisions about underwriters\u2019 liability and limitations on indemnification of underwriters by issuers.\nFor example, a firm that acts as an underwriter may be held liable for material misstatements or omissions of fact in a prospectus used in connection with the securities being offered or for statements made by its securities analysts or other personnel. Therefore, Ladenburg's activities may subject it to the risk of significant legal liabilities to its clients and aggrieved third parties, including stockholders of its clients who could bring securities class actions against Ladenburg. As a result, Ladenburg may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments. Ladenburg's underwriting activities often involve offerings of the securities of smaller companies, which may involve a higher degree of risk and are more volatile than the securities of more established companies. In comparison with more established companies, smaller companies are also more likely to be the subject of securities class actions, to carry directors and officers liability insurance policies with lower limits or not at all, and to become insolvent. Each of these factors increases the likelihood that an underwriter of a smaller company\u2019s securities will be required to contribute to an adverse judgment or settlement of a securities lawsuit.\nWhile we do not expect the outcome of any pending claims against us to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, we cannot assure you that these types of proceedings, which may generate losses that significantly exceed our reserves, will not materially and adversely affect us. Also, legal or regulatory actions could cause significant reputational harm, which could in turn seriously harm our business prospects.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and the failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to penalties or sanctions.\nThe securities industry and our business is subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, state securities regulators and other governmental regulatory authorities. We are also regulated by industry self-regulatory organizations, including FINRA and the MSRB. The regulatory environment is also subject to change and we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other federal or state governmental regulatory authorities, or self-regulatory organizations. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations.\nEach of Securities America, Triad, SSN, Investacorp, KMS and Ladenburg is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and FINRA. Highland is subject to regulation by various regulatory bodies, including state attorneys general and insurance departments.\nPremier Trust is subject to regulation by the Nevada Department of Business and Industry Financial Institutions Division. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations which cover all aspects of the securities business, including:\n\u2022\nsales methods and supervision;\n\u2022\ntrading practices among broker-dealers;\n\u2022\nuse and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities;\n\u2022\ncapital structure of securities firms;\n\u2022\nrecord keeping;\n\u2022\nconduct of directors, officers and employees; and\n\u2022\nadvertising, including regulations related to telephone solicitation.\nCompliance with many of these regulations involves a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be subject to varying interpretation. The requirements imposed by these regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us. Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA. FINRA adopts rules, subject to SEC approval, that govern broker-dealers and conducts periodic examinations of firms\u2019 operations.\nIf we are found to have violated any applicable regulation, formal administrative or judicial proceedings may be initiated against us that may result in:\n\u2022\ncensure;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ncivil penalties, including treble damages in the case of insider trading violations;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of cease-and-desist orders;\n\u2022\nthe termination or suspension of our broker-dealer activities;\n\u2022\nthe suspension or disqualification of our officers, employees or financial advisors; or\n\u2022\nother adverse consequences.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have been subject to some of the penalties listed above. The imposition of any of the penalties listed above could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nExtensive or frequent changes in regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe securities industry is subject to extensive and frequently changing requirements under federal and state securities and other applicable laws and self-regulatory organization rules. The SEC, FINRA, various securities exchanges and other U.S. governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislation and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations may be complex, and we may not have the benefit of regulatory or federal interpretations to guide us in compliance. Changes in laws and regulation or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations also could have an adverse effect on our methods and costs of doing business.\nFor example, certain state securities regulators require that investors in certain securities meet minimum income and/or net worth standards. These standards vary from state to state and change frequently. Changes to suitability standards may require us to expend resources to ensure that we and our financial advisors comply with the new standards. If a financial advisor does not satisfy the requirements with regard to suitability standards, we could be subject to substantial liability, including fines, penalties and possibly rescission. Along with suitability requirements, state regulators have also imposed limitations on an investor\u2019s exposure to direct investment programs. The breadth and scope of these limitations have varied considerably and may operate to limit the exposure that a resident of a particular state has to a product, sponsor or direct investment programs generally. These concentration limitations have been applied with increasing frequency and have increasingly targeted all direct investment programs.\nAlso, as another example, a number of states have adopted data breach protection laws that seek to protect individuals\u2019 personal identifying information (\u201cPII\u201d). These laws impose obligations that may require us to expend additional resources to ensure that we comply, which may vary from state to state. In addition, we may be subject to potential liability to individuals and to the states if we or advisors fail to take sufficient steps to protect PII and/or fail to make the required notifications or implement other required measures.\nFINRA has identified rollovers of client assets from group retirement plans to IRAs as an area of increased scrutiny. FINRA has announced that its periodic regulatory examinations of broker-dealers will focus on this area, including compliance with regulations regarding suitability, conflicts of interest, disclosures to clients and supervision. This enhanced regulatory focus may discourage rollovers of assets into IRAs, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Qualified accounts, specifically IRAs, make up a significant portion of our client assets.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the manner in which we operate our business and interact with regulators and many regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been proposed or implemented. In particular, the impact of the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers by the SEC is uncertain and may require us to expend resources to ensure that we and our financial advisors comply with the new standards.\nIn June 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest concerning the standards of conduct for broker dealers and investment advisers when dealing with retail investors, which will become effective on June 30, 2020. Regulation Best Interest establishes a best interest standard of conduct for broker-dealers recommending a securities transaction or investment strategy to retail customers, including a requirement that the broker-dealer not place its interests ahead of retail customers\u2019 interests, and to identify, disclose and mitigate or eliminate material conflicts of interest arising from financial incentives associated with such recommendations. Broker-dealers and investment advisers will be required to provide retail investors with a brief form summarizing the firms' relationship with the investor. Also, broker-dealers and their associated persons will be restricted in the use of the terms \u201cadvisor\u201d or \u201cadviser.\u201d Regulation Best Interest may affect our business in ways that cannot now be anticipated and may further impact the products and services offered by our financial advisors, including how we receive fees, how we compensate our registered representatives, how we attract and retain registered representatives, and how we design investments and services. Implementation of Regulation Best Interest and any state laws or regulations that impose a fiduciary duty on broker dealers may affect our results, including increased expenditures on legal, compliance, information technology and other costs. Also, we may face enhanced legal risks in connection with compliance with Regulation Best Interest and any state fiduciary duty laws or regulations that may take effect.\nLegislative, judicial or regulatory changes to the classification of independent contractors could increase our operating expenses.\nFrom time to time, various legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal or state levels to change the status of independent contractors\u2019 classification to employees for either employment tax purposes (withholding, social security, Medicare and unemployment taxes) or other benefits available to employees. Currently, most individuals are classified as employees or independent contractors for employment tax purposes based on 20 \u201ccommon law\u201d factors, rather than any definition found in the Internal Revenue Code or Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) regulations. Each of Securities America, Triad, SSN, Investacorp and KMS classifies its financial advisors as independent contractors for all purposes, including employment tax and employee benefit purposes. We cannot assure you that legislative, judicial, or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the employee/independent contractor classification of these firms' financial advisors. The costs associated with potential changes, if any, to these independent contractor classifications could have a material adverse effect on us, including our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with capital requirements could subject us to suspension, revocation or fines by the SEC, FINRA or other regulators.\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC\u2019s Net Capital Rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. Also, under Nevada law, Premier Trust must maintain minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $1,000,000, including at least $250,000 in cash. At December 31, 2019, each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries exceeded its minimum net capital requirement and Premier Trust exceeded its minimum stockholder's equity requirement. The Net Capital Rule is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker-dealer. In computing net capital, various adjustments are made to net worth which exclude assets not readily convertible into cash.\nThe regulations also require that certain assets, such as a broker-dealer\u2019s position in securities, be valued in a conservative manner to avoid inflation of the broker-dealer\u2019s net capital. The Net Capital Rule requires a broker-dealer to maintain a minimum level of net capital. The particular levels vary depending upon the nature of the activity undertaken by a firm. Compliance with the Net Capital Rule limits those operations of broker-dealers which require the intensive use of their capital, such as underwriting commitments and principal trading activities. The rule also limits the ability of securities firms to pay dividends or make payments on certain indebtedness such as subordinated debt as it matures. A significant operating loss or any charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of a broker-dealer to expand or, depending on the magnitude of the loss or charge, maintain its then present level of business. FINRA may enter the offices of a broker-dealer at any time, without notice, and calculate the firm\u2019s net capital. If the calculation reveals a net capital deficiency, FINRA may immediately restrict or suspend some or all of the broker-dealer\u2019s activities, including its ability to make markets. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries may not be able to maintain adequate net capital, or their net capital may fall below requirements established by the SEC and subject us to disciplinary action in the form of fines, censure, suspension, expulsion or the termination of business altogether.\nRisk Factors Relating to Owning Our Securities\nThe price of our Series A Preferred Stock, 6.5% Senior Notes, 7% Senior Notes, 7.25% Senior Notes and 7.75% Senior Notes may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell the shares of our stock or notes at prices you find attractive.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock and senior notes are no longer listed on the NYSE American. The market prices of our securities have historically fluctuated significantly, and we expect that the market price of our securities will continue to fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our Series A Preferred Stock and senior notes may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nvariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions, including conditions in the securities brokerage and investment banking markets;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock and senior notes;\n\u2022\ntrading prices of similar securities;\n\u2022\nthe annual yield from dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and interest on the senior notes as compared to yields on other comparable financial instruments;\n\u2022\nour announcements of significant contracts, milestones or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour relationships with other companies;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain needed capital;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe initiation or outcome of litigation or arbitration proceedings;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlegislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in market prices and trading volume.\nAny one of these factors could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock or senior notes.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and derive all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments or distributions to meet any existing or future debt service and other obligations, including payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock and interest on our senior notes.\nThe deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. Also, FINRA regulations restrict dividends in excess of 10% of a member firm\u2019s excess net capital without FINRA\u2019s prior approval. Compliance with this regulation may impede our ability to receive dividends from our broker-dealer subsidiaries. In addition, any future changes to our corporate structure may inhibit our ability to service our obligations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially due to the nature of our business and therefore we may fail to meet profitability expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors, including: fluctuations in capital markets, which may affect trading activity in commission-based accounts and asset values in fee-based accounts, the level of underwriting and advisory transactions completed by Ladenburg and attrition of financial advisors. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to an increased or decreased number of transactions in any particular quarter or year.\nWe may issue preferred stock with preferential rights that may adversely affect your rights.\nThe rights of our shareholders will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to fix the rights, preferences, privilege and restrictions, including voting rights, of these shares without further shareholder approval.\nMarket interest rates may materially and adversely affect the value of the Series A Preferred Stock and our senior notes.\nOne of the factors that influences the price of the Series A Preferred Stock and the senior notes is the yield on these securities as a percentage of the market price relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of the Series A Preferred Stock and our senior notes to expect a higher yield (and higher market interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs). Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock and the senior notes to materially decrease.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.\nUnder Florida law, we may not make any distribution to our shareholders, including holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, if, after giving effect to the distribution, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferred rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. Our ability to pay cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will require us to have positive net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital and to be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business. In addition, the terms of the instruments governing the outstanding 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and 10.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 and Advisor Group\u2019s senior secured credit facilities, and our guarantees of the obligations thereunder, may place restrictions under certain circumstances on our ability to pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, the Series A Preferred Stock, or other securities subordinated in right of payment to this indebtedness. Further, notwithstanding these factors, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described in this report were to occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions\non our preferred stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nChanges in, or the withdrawal of, our credit rating, or the credit rating of our senior notes, could adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our senior notes.\nCredit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Such ratings are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Our 6.5% Senior Notes, 7% Senior Notes, 7.25% Senior Notes and 7.75% Senior Notes are rated only by one rating agency, Egan-Jones Ratings Co.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal in our rating or the rating of our senior notes, or the anticipation of such a change, including any announcement that our rating is under further review for a downgrade, could have an adverse effect on the price of the senior notes. More generally, a negative change or anticipated negative change in our rating could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets. We cannot be sure our credit rating agency will maintain its initial rating on our senior notes.\nOur credit rating may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes.\nOur credit rating is an assessment by a rating agency of our ability to pay our debts when due. The credit rating may not reflect the potential impact of risks related to structure, market or other factors related to the value of our senior notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization in its sole discretion.", "PERMNO": 87837, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "LTS"}
