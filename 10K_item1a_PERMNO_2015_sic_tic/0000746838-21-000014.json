RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could affect future results include the following:\nCOVID-19\nThe company\u2019s business and results of operations will be, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and workforce participation due to \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d restrictions by various governments worldwide and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related restrictions on travel and transportations, the effect on our customers and clients and demand for our products and services; our ability to sell and provide our products and services, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions; and any closures of our and our customers\u2019 and clients\u2019 offices and facilities all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely impact global economic conditions, our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our cash flow and liquidity, our potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and may require significant actions in response, including but not limited to expense reductions or discounting of pricing of our products, in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the availability and effectiveness of a vaccine, the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on the financial circumstances of our customers, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nIMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS STRATEGY IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MARKETPLACE\nIf the company is unable to attract, motivate and retain experienced personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted.\nThe company\u2019s ability to retain, train and develop its existing associate base in the skills and solutions required to service its target markets with the appropriate solutions is critical to the company\u2019s future success. The company also needs to attract new talent to augment the skills required to deliver its solutions to its target markets. The failure of the company to attract new talent with the requisite skill set, retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan could adversely impact the company\u2019s ability to successfully carry out its business strategy and retain other key personnel.\nFuture results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to grow revenue and expand margin in its Digital Workplace Services and Cloud and Infrastructure businesses.\nThe company\u2019s strategy places an emphasis on an industry go-to-market approach with a focus within the company\u2019s Digital Workplace Services and Cloud and Infrastructure businesses on growing revenue, including specifically on higher-value and higher-margin offerings, while growing revenue and increasing margins with its other offerings such as business process outsourcing solutions. The company\u2019s ability to grow revenue and profitability in these businesses will depend on the level of demand for projects and the portfolio of solutions the company offers. It will also depend on an efficient utilization of services delivery personnel. Revenue and profit margins in these businesses are a function of both the portfolio of solutions sold in a given period and the rates the company is able to charge for services and the chargeability of its professionals. If the company is unable to attain sufficient rates and chargeability for its professionals, revenue and profit margins will be adversely affected. The rates the company is able to charge for services are affected by a number of factors, including clients\u2019 perception of the company\u2019s ability to add value through its services; introduction of new services or products by the company or its competitors; pricing policies of competitors; and general economic conditions. Chargeability is also affected by a number of factors, including the company\u2019s ability to transition resources from completed projects to new engagements and across geographies, and its ability to forecast demand for services and thereby maintain appropriate resource levels. The company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted if sales of higher-margin offerings do not offset declines in revenue and profitability of lower-margin offerings.\nFuture results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain its installed base and sell new solutions.\nThe company continues to invest in its ClearPath Forward operating system software in order to retain existing clients in its ClearPath Forward business. If clients do not believe in the value proposition provided by ClearPath Forward or choose not to\nrenew their contracts for any other reason, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments, and revenue could decline meaningfully. Furthermore, if ClearPath Forward is sold in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) at an accelerated pace, this would have a negative impact on the company\u2019s short- and medium-term cash position and could adversely impact the company\u2019s operations, financial condition and liquidity. The company also continues to invest in its Stealth family of software, as well as in other software and solutions. If the company is unsuccessful in selling these Stealth products or other solutions and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by Stealth and other new solutions and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if the company is unable to retain its installed base.\nThe company faces aggressive competition in the information services and technology marketplace, which could lead to reduced demand for the company\u2019s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe information services and technology markets in which the company operates include a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. The company\u2019s competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Some of the company\u2019s competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price-performance or that reach the market in advance of the company\u2019s offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than the company, with enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for the company\u2019s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s business. Future results will depend on the company\u2019s ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins.\nThe company\u2019s future results may be adversely impacted if it is unable to effectively anticipate and respond to volatility and rapid technological innovation in its industry.\nThe company operates in a highly volatile industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, evolving technology standards, short product life cycles and continually changing customer demand patterns. Future success will depend in part on the company\u2019s ability to anticipate and respond to these market trends and to design, develop, introduce, deliver or obtain new and innovative services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis using new delivery models such as cloud computing. Additionally, the company may not be successful in anticipating or responding to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, and the market may not demand or accept its services and product offerings. In addition, services and products developed by competitors may make the company\u2019s offerings less competitive.\nThe company\u2019s future results will depend on its ability to retain significant clients and attract new clients to its solutions.\nThe company has a number of significant long-term contracts with clients, including governmental entities, and its future success will depend, in part, on retaining its relationships with these clients. The company could lose clients for reasons such as contract expiration, conversion to a competing service provider, disputes with clients or a decision to in-source services. The company could also lose clients as a result of their merger, acquisition or business failure. The company may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client. The company is expecting revenue, margin and market share expansion due to decisions by some of the company\u2019s competitors to exit or de-emphasize their focus on the company\u2019s target markets. If such competitor\u2019s change that position, it could impact the company\u2019s ability to gain market share.\nThe company\u2019s contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues.\nIn a number of the company\u2019s long-term services contracts, the company\u2019s revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at contract inception are not guaranteed. The company\u2019s contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. In addition, some of these contracts may permit termination at the customer\u2019s discretion before the end of the contract term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if the company does not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.\nSome of the company\u2019s services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the company assumes the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should the company experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required. Future results will depend on the company\u2019s ability to perform these services contracts profitably.\nThe inability of the company to develop or acquire the capabilities to enhance the company\u2019s solutions could adversely impact the company\u2019s revenue and margins and result in the failure to expand the company\u2019s market share.\nThe company\u2019s financial objectives require it to develop, acquire or orchestrate with its strategic partnership network the prerequisite capabilities to enhance the company\u2019s solutions so they contain higher-growth, higher-margin offerings and allow for the expansion of market share. If the company is unable to do so, its financial performance may be adversely impacted.\nAn increase in the concentration of the company\u2019s business in the global commercial sector of the information technology industry may subject the company\u2019s financial results to increased volatility and greater risk.\nThe company\u2019s operational and financial profile has changed due to the sale of the company\u2019s former U.S. Federal business. As a result, the company\u2019s diversification of historical revenue sources has diminished, and the company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and greater risk as a result of the concentration of its business in the global commercial sector of the information technology industry. Moreover, the shares of the company\u2019s common stock will represent an investment in a smaller company than in existence prior to the asset sale and the company\u2019s exposure to the risks inherent in its remaining businesses will increase. Additionally, the company\u2019s ability to return to the U.S. Federal market is restricted by the terms of the non-competition commitments made to Science Applications International Corporation pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement governing the sale. As a result, the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on market disruptions and the acceleration of our target markets transformation to digital platforms could be impeded.\nDEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS\nThe company has significant pension obligations and required cash contributions and may be required to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans.\nThe company has significant unfunded obligations under its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2020, the company made cash contributions of $826.2 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans, which were comprised of $791.1 million for the company\u2019s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and $35.1 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2021 the company estimates that it will make cash contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans of approximately $250.6 million, which are comprised of a voluntary contribution of $200.0 million for the company\u2019s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and approximately $50.6 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions and changes in discount rates. If estimates for future contributions change materially, the company may need to obtain additional funding in order to make future contributions. In this event, there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such funding or that the company will have enough cash on hand to pay the required cash contributions.\nDeterioration in the value of the company\u2019s worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes, asset return changes, or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require the company to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would further reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may worsen the adverse impact on the company\u2019s operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTAX ASSETS\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nA corporation\u2019s ability to deduct its federal NOL carryforwards and utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. A future tax \u201cownership change\u201d pursuant to Section 382, may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes.\nGENERAL BUSINESS RISKS\nA significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States, and the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally.\nA significant amount of the company\u2019s total revenue is derived from international operations. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changing global data privacy regulations, currency\nrestrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, regulations in the European Union such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K. Bribery Act and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations.\nThe company could face business and financial risk in implementing future acquisitions or dispositions.\nAs part of the company\u2019s business strategy, it may from time to time consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses, or disposing of existing technologies, products and businesses, including transactions of a material size. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include integration difficulties; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience; potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Potential risks with respect to dispositions include difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. Further, with respect to both acquisitions and dispositions, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect the company\u2019s ability to consummate acquisitions or dispositions. The risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all.\nCybersecurity breaches could result in the company incurring significant costs and could harm the company\u2019s business and reputation.\nThe company\u2019s business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within the company\u2019s own IT systems and those that the company designs, develops, hosts or manages for clients. Cybersecurity breaches involving these systems by hackers, other third parties or the company\u2019s employees, despite established security controls, could disrupt these systems or result in the loss or corruption of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of information of the company, its clients or others. This could result in claims, investigations, litigation and legal liability for the company, lead to the loss of existing or potential clients and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of the security and reliability of the company\u2019s services and products. In addition, such breaches could subject the company to fines and penalties for violations of laws and result in the company incurring other significant costs. This may negatively impact the company\u2019s reputation and financial results.\nFuture results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships.\nThe company maintains business relationships with key partners, suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and the company\u2019s relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect the company\u2019s capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users.\nA failure to meet standards or expectations with respect to the company\u2019s environmental, social and governance practices could adversely impact the company\u2019s business and reputation.\nMany governmental bodies and current and prospective investors, clients, partners, and employees are increasing their focus on corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. If the company fails meet the standards or expectations of any of these groups, the company may suffer reputational damage, the company\u2019s business may be adversely impacted and the company may find it more difficult to recruit or retain key personnel.\nIf the company is unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact the company\u2019s business and liquidity.\nMarket conditions may impact the company\u2019s ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to the company or at all. If the company is unable to access the financing markets, the company would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and the company\u2019s required pension contributions and repay outstanding debt as it comes due. There is no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and required pension contributions and refinance such debt. A failure by the company to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on its business if the company were unable to access financing markets and may result in a default with respect to the company\u2019s pension obligation and under the\ncompany\u2019s debt agreements. Market conditions may also impact the company\u2019s ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business.\nA reduction in the company\u2019s credit rating could adversely affect its business and/or the holders of its securities.\nThe credit rating agencies rating the company\u2019s indebtedness regularly evaluate the company, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the company\u2019s financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within the company\u2019s control, including conditions affecting the information technology industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that the company will maintain its current credit ratings. A downgrade of the company\u2019s credit ratings could adversely affect its access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase its cost of funds, decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the company or purchase its securities and impact the company\u2019s ability to utilize surety bonds or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business. This could affect the company\u2019s growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.\nThe company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases.\nIf global economic conditions deteriorate, the company could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. The company could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. The company\u2019s business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters and the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases. Current world tensions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on the company\u2019s business. If, as a result of such an event, the company\u2019s clients in a particular industry were to suffer material adverse impacts, the company may experience a reduction in demand for its services and products from such clients, which may materially and adversely affect the company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of Brexit could adversely affect the company\u2019s operations in the United Kingdom as well as the funded status of the company\u2019s U.K. pension plans.\nThe impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d, and the resulting effect on the political and economic future of the U.K. and the European Union is uncertain. Depending on the outcome, the company may decide to alter its European operations to respond to the new business, legal, regulatory, tax and trade environments that may result, which may adversely affect the company\u2019s financial results. In addition, uncertainty regarding Brexit could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., the European Union or globally. As a result of these possible effects, among others, Brexit could adversely impact the company\u2019s operations in the U.K., cause increased volatility in the measurement of the pension assets or benefit obligations in the company\u2019s U.K. pension plans, as well as adversely affect the funded status of the company\u2019s U.K. pension plans.\nA significant disruption in the company\u2019s IT systems could adversely affect the company\u2019s business and reputation.\nWe rely extensively on our IT systems to conduct our business and perform services for our clients. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are accessed without our authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, we could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to conduct our business, and damage the market\u2019s perception of our services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in the company failing to meet performance standards and obligations in its client contracts, which could subject the company to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect the company\u2019s reputation and financial results.\nThe company may face damage to its reputation or legal liability if its clients are not satisfied with its services or products.\nThe success of the company\u2019s business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on its reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with the company\u2019s services or products, its reputation could be damaged and its business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about the company, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm its reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if the company fails to meet its contractual obligations, it could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe company\u2019s services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe company cannot be sure that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and it may have infringement claims asserted against it or against its clients. These claims could cost the company money, prevent it from offering some services or products, or damage its reputation.\nLegal proceedings could affect the company\u2019s results of operations or cash flow or may adversely affect the company\u2019s business or reputation.\nVarious lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that have been brought or asserted against the company in the past relating to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. The company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that the company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period as a result of future developments of the legal matters pending against it, including the resolution of any such matters. Additional legal proceedings may arise in the future with respect to the company\u2019s existing and legacy operations that may adversely affect the company\u2019s business or reputation.\nOther factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results.", "PERMNO": 10890, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "UIS"}
