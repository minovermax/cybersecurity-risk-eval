{"cik": "1576169", "company": "Benefitfocus, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have had a history of losses, and we might not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have had a history of net losses, including of $33.2 million, $24.3 million, and $45.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We cannot predict if we will achieve sustained profitability in the near future or at all. We expect to make significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business. In addition, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company. These expenditures make it harder for us to achieve and maintain future profitability. We might not achieve sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. We could incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we might not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and might continue to fluctuate, causing the value of our common stock to decline substantially.\nOur quarterly operating results might fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis might not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as indicative of our future performance. Moreover, our stock price might be based on expectations of future performance that are unrealistic or that we might not meet and, if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. For example, on March 16, 2020, in connection with a widespread market crash triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, our stock price dropped $2.25 per share from the previous trading day\u2019s close, or approximately 24.4%, to $6.97. Additionally, our stock traded at a multi-year low in March 2020 of $6.09 per share.\nOur operating results have varied in the past. In addition to other risk factors listed in this section, some of the important factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe potential economic impact of COVID-19 on our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our products and services achieve or maintain market acceptance, including through brokers;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, including the rate of expansion of our sales force;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment related to benefits and healthcare, including any changes that may result from the upcoming Congressional midterm elections;\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce new products and services and enhancements to our existing products and services on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nnew competitors and the introduction of enhanced products and services from competitors;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of our current and potential customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer budgets and procurement policies;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties with our products or interruptions in our services;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance costs;\n\u2022\nthe timing, size, and integration success of recent and potential future acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses, including stockholder activist, litigation, and settlement costs.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls might decrease our gross margins and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.\nBecause we recognize revenue and expense relating to monthly subscriptions and professional services over varying periods, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nAs a SaaS company, under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606, we recognize our subscription revenue monthly for the term of our contracts and therefore a shortfall in demand for our software solutions and professional services or a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter might not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter, but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our products and services might not be reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods.\nOur revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from new customers has to be recognized over the applicable term of the contracts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business and the duration and extent to which the pandemic will impact our future financial performance remains uncertain.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, which rapidly spread across the globe and resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While vaccinations became widely available in the United States in 2021 and allowed for the partial reopening of the economy, the recent \u201cDelta\u201d and \u201cOmicron\u201d variants as well as possibility of any future variants of the virus, and reduced efficacy of vaccines over time and the possibility that a large number of people decline to get vaccinated or receive booster shots, create inherent uncertainty as to the future of our business and the economy in general in light of the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a continued adverse impact on our business and future financial performance. In response, in 2020, we took several measures to contain costs and preserve our liquidity profile, including, among other things, implementing our previously reported restructuring plan and executive compensation and Board of Director compensation reductions. We also took precautionary measures to help ensure the safety and mental and physical well-being of our associates and customers, including implementing a mandatory work-from-home policy, and establishing a COVID-19 Resource Center for our customers and funds to help support our own at-risk employees and their families. We have shifted to a permanent hybrid workforce that combines remote work with traditional in-office resources.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results remains uncertain and depends on future developments, including, among other things, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions taken by governments and authorities to contain the virus or treat its impact, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, the impact of the pandemic on our associates, including key personnel, the impact of business disruptions on our customers and the resulting impact on their demand for our products and services, layoffs by our employer customers, our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products and services, and our ability to provide services to individuals. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including as a result of any recession that might occur. If we are unable to successfully respond to and manage the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting responses to it, our business, financial condition, and results of operation could continue to be adversely impacted.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nProxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders have been waged against many companies in our industry over the last several years, including our Company in 2021. Activist stockholders might agitate, either publicly or privately, for changes to a company\u2019s board of directors, management, structure, spend or strategic direction, among other things. Such actions might cause significant disruption to a company\u2019s operations and cause a company to expend a significant amount of time and resources in responding to their requests.\nIf faced with a proxy contest or other activist stockholder request or action in the future, we might not be able or willing to respond successfully to the contest, action, or request, which could be significantly disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by any proxy contest or activist stockholder request or action involving us because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and associates, and can lead to uncertainty\u037e\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to the future direction of the Company or its business might result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities, and might make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners\u037e and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it might adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan in a timely manner and create additional value for our stockholders.\nAny such activist stockholder contests, actions or requests, or the mere public presence of activist stockholders among our stockholder base, could cause the market price for our ordinary shares to experience periods of significant volatility.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more key associates or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled associates could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers and other associates. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, services, finance, and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors in sales and research and development. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. For example: in 2021, Stephen Swad stepped down as president and chief executive officer and was replaced by Matthew Levin. Additionally, Mason Holland stepped down from his position as Executive Chairman and a member of the Board, effective at the Company\u2019s 2021 annual stockholders meeting. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key associates could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo continue to execute our growth strategy, we also must attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition is intense for salespeople and for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services. We might not be successful in maintaining our unique culture and continuing to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled personnel with appropriate qualifications. The pool of qualified personnel with SaaS experience and/or experience working with the benefits market is limited and many of the companies with which we complete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have.\nIn addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our stock might, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled personnel. Furthermore, the requirement to expense certain stock awards might discourage us from granting the size or type of stock awards that job candidates require to join our company. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe benefits management software market is highly competitive and is likely to attract increased competition, which could make it hard for us to succeed. Small, specialized providers continue to become more sophisticated and effective. In addition, large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated software companies might focus more on our market. The size and financial strength of these entities is increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries. We expect large integrated software companies to become more active in our market, both through acquisitions and internal investment. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to bring certain of their benefits software solutions in-house, whether through acquisitions or internal investment. For example, Aetna, a customer of ours, owns bswift, a provider of insurance exchange technology solutions and benefits administration technology solutions and services. If Aetna were to decide to use bswift\u2019s solution in place of any portion of the solutions we currently provide to them, then our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation might change the competitive landscape in favor of our competitors.\nSome of our current large competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do. As a result, our competitors might be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and might in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products in the marketplace. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances might emerge that have greater market share, a larger customer base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Further, in light of these advantages, even if our products and services are more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitive offerings in lieu of purchasing our offerings. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, or market share. In addition to new niche vendors, who offer standalone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions that have information systems in place with potential customers in our target market. These existing enterprise vendors might promise products or services that offer ease of integration with existing systems and which leverage existing vendor relationships. In addition, large insurance carriers often have internal technology staffs and proprietary software for benefits management, making them less likely to buy our solutions.\nThe market for our products and services is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop or if it develops more slowly than we expect, the growth of our business will be harmed.\nThe cloud-based benefits management software market is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of employers, carriers, consumers and brokers to increase their use of benefits management software. Many employers and carriers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate internally developed solutions or traditional enterprise software into\ntheir businesses for benefits management, and therefore might be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to our cloud-based solutions, including Benefit Catalog. Furthermore, some businesses might be reluctant to use cloud-based solutions because they have concerns about the security of their data and the reliability of the technology delivery model associated with these solutions. If employers, carriers, consumers and brokers do not perceive the benefits of our solutions, then our market might not develop at all, or it might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which could significantly adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we might make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. If any of these risks occur, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe SaaS pricing model is evolving and our failure to manage its evolution and demand could lead to lower than expected revenue and profit.\nWe derive most of our revenue growth from subscription offerings and, specifically, SaaS offerings. This business model depends heavily on achieving economies of scale because the initial upfront investment is costly and the associated revenue is recognized on a ratable basis. If we fail to achieve appropriate economies of scale or if we fail to manage or anticipate the evolution and demand of the SaaS pricing model, then our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers and provide high quality support services, we might not remain competitive, and our revenue and operating results could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on providing products and services that consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers will use to manage benefits. We have refocused on customer-driven innovation and must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new high-quality products and services that customers will want. If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our products and services on a timely basis, we might lose customers. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our customers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our competitors might be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by us. This would force us to compete on additional product and service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.\nIn addition, we may experience difficulties with software development, industry standards, design, or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new solutions and enhancements. The introduction of new solutions by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards, or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could render our existing or future solutions obsolete.\nOur success also depends on providing high quality support services to resolve any issues related to our products and services. High quality education and customer support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our products and services and for the renewal of existing customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe sell our products and services pursuant to agreements that are generally one to three years for employers and three to five years for health plans. While our employer contracts generally automatically renew, our health plan customers have no obligation to renew their contracts after their contract period expires, and these contracts might not be renewed on the same or on more profitable terms if at all. Additionally, some of our health plan customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience, although generally our health plan contracts are only cancellable by the health plan in an instance of our uncured breach. As a result, our ability to grow depends in part on the continuance and renewal of our health plan contracts. We have experienced increased customer non-renewal over the past year or so. We cannot accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the cost of our services, the cost of services offered by our competitors, consolidations or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If our health plan customers terminate or do not renew their contracts for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or products, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our profitability and gross margins may be harmed.\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from our largest customers, and any reduction in revenue from any of these customers would reduce our revenue and net income.\nOur ten largest customers by revenue accounted for approximately 32%, 34% and 37% of our consolidated revenue in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2021, 2020 or 2019. If any of our large customers or strategic partners decides not to renew its contracts with us, or to renew on less favorable terms, our business, revenue, reputation, and our ability to obtain new customers could be materially and adversely affected.\nConsolidation among our customers and within the IT and healthcare industries may negatively impact our operating results.\nA number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power or reduced customer spending on software and services. Consolidation among our customers could also reduce the demand for our products and services if customers streamline their operations, reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions.\nIn addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. Consolidated competitors could have considerable financial resources, channel influence, and broad geographic reach; thus, they can engage in competition on the basis of product differentiation, pricing, marketing, services, support and more. If any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and services that we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger portfolio of products and services, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nEconomic or geopolitical uncertainties or downturns in the general economy or the industries in which our customers operate could disproportionately affect the demand for our solutions and negatively impact our results of operations.\nGeneral worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions have experienced significant downturns in the past, and market volatility and uncertainty remain widespread, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and tension in Ukraine. This makes it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. In addition, these conditions could cause our customers or prospective customers to decrease headcount, benefits, or HR budgets, which could decrease corporate spending on our products and services, resulting in delayed and lengthened sales cycles, a decrease in new customer acquisition, and/or loss of customers. Furthermore, during challenging economic times, our customers may have difficulty gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining credit on reasonable terms, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us and adversely affect our revenue. If that were to occur, our financial results could be harmed. Further, challenging economic conditions might impair the ability of our customers to pay for the products and services they already have purchased from us and, as a result, our write-offs of accounts receivable could increase. For example, during 2020 we experienced an increase in early termination and credit requests from our customers. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery. If the condition of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsens, our business could be harmed.\nFailure to adequately and effectively expand our direct sales force will impede our growth.\nWe believe that our future growth will in part depend on the development of our direct sales force and its ability to obtain new customers and to expand and further develop our existing customer base. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our software requires significant time, expense, and attention. It can take six months or longer before a new sales representative is fully trained and productive. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand, train and retrain our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. For example, reductions of our salesforce in 2016, 2018 and 2020, among other factors, negatively impacted sales, and as a result, revenue going forward. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retrain sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, sales of our products and services will suffer and our growth will be impeded.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties, including brokers.\nIn order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on our relationships with third parties including resellers such as SAP SE, and other referral sources such as brokers, consultants, specialty benefits providers, insurance carriers, technology and content providers, administrative service providers and third-party system integrators. Identifying partners, negotiating and documenting relationships with them, and developing referral sources requires significant time and resources. In the first quarter of 2019, Mercer sold all of its Benefitfocus stock and we amended our commercial relationship with Mercer to better align with our strategic priorities and current trends in the marketplace. Our revised commercial agreement with them led to a reduction in our revenue from the relationship in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and believe this trend will continue in 2022. Our competitors might be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our products and services. Acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our applications by potential customers. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer use of our applications or increased revenue.\nIf the number of individuals covered by our employer and health plan customers decreases or the number of products or services to which our employer and health plan customers subscribe or their employees purchase decreases, our revenue will decrease.\nUnder most of our customer contracts, we base our fees on the number of individuals to whom our customers provide benefits and the number of products or services subscribed to by our customers or purchased by their employees. Many factors may lead to a\ndecrease in the number of individuals covered by our customers and the number of products or services subscribed to by our customers, including:\n\u2022\nlayoffs by our customers or affecting our customers, in response to the COVID pandemic or otherwise;\n\u2022\nfailure of our customers to adopt or maintain effective business practices;\n\u2022\nchanges in the nature or operations of our customers;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations; and\n\u2022\nincreased competition or other changes in the benefits marketplace.\nIf the number of individuals covered by our customers or the number of products or services subscribed to by our customers decreases for any reason, our revenue will likely decrease and could affect the contractual minimums for renewals in future periods.\nFailure to manage our continued growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue, and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.\nWe have experienced growth in the past and anticipate future growth, which could put a strain on our business. To manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our IT infrastructure, financial and accounting systems, and controls. We also must attract, train, and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, customer support personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel, and management personnel. Failure to effectively manage our anticipated future growth could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities, and result in loss of associates and reduced productivity of remaining associates. Our anticipated future growth could require significant capital expenditures and might divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of new products and services. If our management is unable to effectively manage our anticipated future growth, our expenses might increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or might grow more slowly than expected, and we might be unable to implement our business strategy. The quality of our products and services might suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nIf we fail to maintain awareness of our brand cost-effectively, our business might suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to continuing the widespread acceptance of our existing solutions and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. Our efforts to build, maintain and market changes to our brand nationally have involved significant expenses. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in maintaining our brand. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or other tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which began expiring unutilized in 2020 and will continue expiring through 2039 if not utilized. We also have South Carolina jobs tax credit and headquarters tax credit carryforwards, some of which have expired unutilized. The tax credit carryforwards that expire unused are unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules might apply under state tax laws. Future issuances of our stock could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d. It is possible that an ownership change, or any future ownership change, could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe might be unable to adequately protect, and we might incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent, and unfair competition laws, as well as license and access agreements and\nother contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring associates and consultants to enter into confidentiality, noncompetition, and assignment of inventions agreements. Our attempts to protect our intellectual property might be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have a number of patents granted in the United States and other jurisdictions including China, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Canada, we might not be able to obtain meaningful patent protection for our software. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they might not provide us with any competitive advantages, or might be successfully challenged by third parties. Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and might not be enforceable in certain cases. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business. Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. Moreover, the laws of other countries in which we might in the future conduct operations or contract for services might afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. Any litigation that is necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe might be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nThe software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and might receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Our technologies might not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights, and most require us to indemnify our clients for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.\nMoreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the software or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of it. We might not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties asserting an infringement claim; we might not be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; and we might not be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected services. Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others.\nAny litigation could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe may become subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former associates or their prior employers, or purported securities class actions. For example, in March 2021, the Company was included as a defendant in a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of a class of persons who acquired our common stock in or traceable to our March 2019 secondary public offering. The complaint alleges that defendants violated the federal securities laws by, among other things, making misrepresentations about our commercial relationships and failing to disclose certain material adverse facts, trends or uncertainties or significant risks that made the secondary public offering speculative and risky. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the trading price of our stock.\nAcquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future. For example, in November 2021, we acquired Tango Health, Inc. We spent considerable time, effort, and money pursuing this acquisition and need now to continue to successfully integrate it into our business. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying and acquiring products, technologies or businesses that will help our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nrisk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience; and\n\u2022\ndelays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, we might incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.\nFuture sales to customers outside the United States or with international operations might expose us to risks inherent in international sales which, if realized, could adversely affect our business.\nAn element of our growth strategy is to expand internationally. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations, our international expansion efforts might not be successful in creating demand for our products and services outside of the United States or in effectively selling our solutions in the international markets we enter. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nunstable regional political and economic conditions, such as those caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or tensions in Ukraine;\n\u2022\nthe need to localize and adapt our solutions for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\ndata privacy and security laws, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation and data localization laws that require data to be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds; and\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences.\nIf we denominate our international contracts in local currencies, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies might impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars.\nChanges in and interpretations of accounting principles and their implementation could have an adverse impact on our reported financial results.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These rules are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could have a negative impact on our reported financial results and may retroactively affect previously reported transactions. For example, we incurred considerable cost and effort to implement the new lease standard in 2019.\nImplementation of these new standards, and any future accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, or interpretations, could have an adverse impact on our reported financial results, require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls, or the way we conduct our business. In addition, we have expended and might in the future expend considerable effort and resources implementing accounting updates, which in and of itself could have negative impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Services Offerings\nThe breach or failure of our security measures, unauthorized access to or disclosure of customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 data, or disruption of our products or services caused by security breaches or other incidents may result in our products and services being perceived as unsecure, cause customers and consumers to curtail or stop using our products and services, and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 confidential information, which may include sensitive individually identifiable information that is subject to stringent legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations. Because of the sensitivity of this information, our privacy and security measures related to our products and service offerings, including the security features of our software, are very important. Although we have privacy and security measures in place designed to protect customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 data and our systems, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems and data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target. It is also possible that, due to the surreptitious nature of certain data breaches and other incidents, they may remain undetected for an extended period, which may exacerbate harm to the company. We cannot ensure that our measures will not be breached or otherwise fail to protect confidential information or prevent disruption of our products and services, including as a result of inadvertent disclosures through technological or human error (including associates or service provider error), malfeasance, hacking, ransomware, social engineering (including phishing schemes), computer viruses, malware, or otherwise. Unauthorized individuals may acquire or obtain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 or consumers\u2019 confidential information (including medical, financial or other personal information). Data breaches, failures of our privacy or security measures, inadvertent disclosures, disruptions of our products and services, and other incidents could result in serious harm to our reputation, our business could suffer, and we could incur serious liability and other expenses related to litigation (including damages associated with breach-of-contract claims and consumer litigation), penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, costly litigation or government investigations, and remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences.\nWe rely on various parties (including as users of our products, services, and systems), such as employers\u2019 HR departments, carriers, service providers, and consumers themselves for key services and activities that impact the security of our products, services, and systems and the privacy and security of data and information accessible within them. These key services and activities include data hosting and administration of enrollment, consumer status changes, claims, and billing. These individuals and organizations may, for example, experience data breaches or cause unauthorized access to or disclosure of information. Our customers may authorize or enable third parties to access their information and data that is stored on our systems. Because we do not determine such access, we cannot ensure the complete security, confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such data in our systems.\nPrivacy and security incidents are not uncommon in our industry due to the nature of our industry\u2019s services, the high volume of sensitive information involved, and the desirability of that information to bad actors. Incidents involving phishing, hacking, and misdirected communications containing sensitive information can and do occur. Customers and end-users of our industry\u2019s products and services are also the source of privacy and security incidents, sometimes due to failures to adhere to appropriate privacy and data security practices. For example, employers sometimes fail to terminate the account credentials of former employees or permit current employees to share account credentials.\nLike others in our industry, we experience cyber-attacks and other attempts to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. When we become aware of privacy or security incidents, we work diligently to address them, including by working to terminate unauthorized or inappropriate access and implementing additional measures, training, and providing guidance to customers and end users in order to avoid the reoccurrence and future incidents. Although to date privacy and security incidents have not been material, they could expose us to significant expense, legal liability, and harm to our reputation, which might result in loss of business.\nOur failure or failure by our customers to obtain proper permissions and waivers might result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.\nWe require our customers to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of information on the Benefitfocus Platform, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so. If, however, despite these requirements and contractual obligations, our customers or consumers do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf might be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws. This could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and might prevent use of such data. In addition, this could interfere with, or prevent creation or use of, rules, analyses, or other data-driven activities that benefit us and our business. Moreover, we might be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notices, agreements, permissions or waivers. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur proprietary software might not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nProprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex. Unforeseen difficulties can arise. We might encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover problems that prevent our proprietary applications from operating\nproperly. If they do not function reliably or fail to achieve customer expectations in terms of performance, customers could assert liability claims against us and/or attempt to cancel their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain customers.\nMoreover, benefits management software as complex as ours has in the past contained, and may in the future contain, or develop, undetected defects or errors. Material performance problems or defects in our products and services might arise in the future. Errors might result from the interface of our services with legacy systems and data, which we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control. Defects or errors might arise in our existing or new software or service processes. Because changes in employer, carrier, and legal requirements and practices relating to benefits are frequent, we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices. Undiscovered vulnerabilities could expose our software to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy software programs that could attack our software or result in unauthorized access to, acquisition of, or disclosure of customer data. Defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share, liability to customers or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development and other resources, injury to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs. Defects or errors in our product or service processes might discourage existing or potential customers from purchasing services from us. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability might be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, customers that rely on our products and services to collect, manage, and report benefits data might have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than customers of software products in general. We market and sell services that, among other things, provide information to assist care providers in tracking and treating ill patients. Any operational delay in or failure of our software service processes might result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to our business and operating results.\nOur customers might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our product or service processes. A product liability claim or errors or omissions claim could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such a claim.\nVarious events could interrupt customers\u2019 access to the Benefitfocus Platform, exposing us to significant costs.\nThe ability to access the Benefitfocus Platform is critical to our customers. Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures, (ii) fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters, (iii) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes in our own systems or in other systems, (iv) computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, hacking and similar disruptive problems in our own systems and in other systems, and (v) civil unrest, war, and/or terrorism. We have implemented various measures to protect against interruptions of customers\u2019 access to our platform. If customers\u2019 access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by customers, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to customers or medical information relevant to patient care. Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely on third-party providers of related services. If those vendors fail us at a time when our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations. Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain customers and sell our services, which would adversely impact our revenue.\nIn addition, retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention, accuracy, and access. Some laws impose obligations on our customers and on us to produce information for third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction. Our failure to meet these obligations might result in liability, which could increase our costs and reduce our operating results.\nWe currently rely on data center providers, Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our customers, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with customers, adversely affecting our brand and our business.\nWe currently serve our customers primarily from three data centers, located in Raleigh, North Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Ashburn, Virginia. While we control and have access to our servers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. The owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Problems faced by our third-party data center locations, with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Our third-party data centers operators could decide to close their facilities without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy faced by our third-party data centers operators or any of the service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict.\nIn addition, our ability to deliver our web-based services depends on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, bandwidth capacity, and security. Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments. However, we have experienced and expect that we will experience future interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of our systems, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with customers. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss, natural disasters and other force majeure events outside our control;\n\u2022\ncommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures, and crashes;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, computer viruses, hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and similar disruptive problems; and\n\u2022\nother potential interruptions.\nWe also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services, including software from Oracle Corporation and Microsoft Corporation, and routers and network equipment from Cisco and Dell. This hardware and software is generally commercially available on varying terms. However, it is possible that this hardware and software might not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated.\nWe also rely on third-party partnerships to provide certain of our products and services to our customers, including billing and payments and COBRA administration. Our ability to timely and accurately deliver these services depends on the reliability of these third-party partnerships. If we or our third-party partners are unable to deliver these products and services at the quality level that our customers expect, the relationship with our customers might be harmed which could adversely impact renewal rates and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe exercise limited control over third-party vendors and partners, which increases our vulnerability to problems with technology and information services they provide. Interruptions in our network access and services might in connection with third-party technology and information services reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, subject us to potential liability, or adversely affect our renewal rates. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we might not be able to continue to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost, if at all.\nInterruptions or delays in migrating our service from our third-party data center hosting facilities to cloud computing and hosting providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe are in the process of migrating our primary data centers to Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing and hosting provider, to help lower cost, optimize infrastructure efficiency and support strategic growth. Despite precautions taken during any of these data center moves and data transfers, any unsuccessful data transfers might impair the delivery of our service and could materially and adversely disrupt our operations and our service delivery to our customers, which could result in contractual penalties or damage claims from customers. In addition, changes to our data center infrastructure could occur over a period longer than planned, could require greater than expected investment and other internal and external resources and could cause us to incur increased costs as we operate multiple data center facilities. It might also take longer than expected to realize the intended favorable benefits from any data center infrastructure migrations and improvements, and disruptions or unexpected costs might continue to occur while we enhance our data center infrastructure, all of which could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nIf we are unable to rely on temporary staff during peak enrollment periods, our business might suffer.\nDuring peak enrollment periods, the Company relies on its permanent associates, as well as temporary seasonal staff, who help provide software-related development, quality assurance, maintenance, and other technical support services for certain of our solutions. Our temporary staff might not have the same level of experience and commitment as our permanent associates. If the Company\u2019s customers are dissatisfied with their customer service experience or the quality of the product or service they receive, the relationship with our customers might be harmed, which could adversely impact renewal rates and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the Company has in the past, and expects to continue in the future, source temporary staff located in various international locations, including India and the Philippines. Political changes or geopolitical instability could disrupt or limit the work our international temporary staff are able to perform. Additionally, certain of our customers or potential customers, including state government agencies, have compliance requirements regarding the onshoring of our workforce. If we are unable to rely on international temporary employees due to geopolitical instability or customer requirements, our customer base, the range of services we are able to provide our customers or our cost for such services might be adversely affected.\nThe use of open source software in our products and solutions may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights.\nSome of our products and solutions use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable, and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user\u2019s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on potentially unfavorable terms or at no cost.\nThe terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. Accordingly, there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products or solutions, to re-develop our products or solutions, to discontinue sales of our products or solutions, or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could harm our business. Further, given the nature of open source software, it may be more likely that third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of these open source software programs.\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our products, solutions, processes, and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product or solution when we do not wish to do so, it is possible that such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying our proprietary solutions. In addition, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products and solutions without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our products and solutions. This could harm our intellectual property position and our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nGovernment regulation of the areas in which we operate creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.\nThe healthcare and wellness industries are highly-regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Changes in the laws and regulations may impact the operating environment and healthcare market and, by extension, the employee benefits industry. Among other impacts, existing and new laws and regulations affecting the employee benefits industry could create legal liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs and/or restrict our operations. These laws and regulations are complex and their application to specific services and relationships are not always clear. In particular, many existing laws and regulations affecting employee benefits, when enacted, did not anticipate the services that we provide, and these laws and regulations might be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business. Some of the risks we face from the regulation of employee benefits are as follows:\n\u2022\nHealthcare Market Reforms. Healthcare services and benefits are delivered and reimbursed under an increasingly intricate, and frequently uncertain, statutory and regulatory framework. Ongoing efforts to repeal and/or reform part or all of the PPACA, new payment models for certain federal healthcare programs, and efforts to slow the growth in healthcare spending and to alter the regulatory landscape have created uncertainty in the healthcare industry broadly. Although many of these laws and regulations do not directly apply to us, they may affect the business of many of our customers. For instance, carriers and large employers might experience changes in the numbers of individuals they insure as a result of the elimination of the penalty associated with PPACA\u2019s individual mandate, possible repeal of guaranteed issue, and flux in the state and national exchanges under PPACA. Although we are unable to predict with any reasonable certainty or otherwise quantify the likely impact of PPACA reform efforts and other regulatory initiatives on our business model, financial condition, and operations, as well as changes in the business of our customers and the number of individuals they insure, may negatively impact our business.\nIn addition to marketplace reforms, legislative efforts at cost containment in healthcare programs are ongoing. For example, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to certain providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Similarly, at the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control costs, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services. These laws, and others, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the business of our customers.\n\u2022The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Stark Law, and related laws. Providers and suppliers that accept reimbursement from federal and state healthcare programs, and those that contract with them, are required to comply with various laws and regulations intended to minimize the risk of fraud and abuse. These laws include the federal anti-kickback statute, which attaches criminal liability to unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded healthcare programs; the Stark Law, which attach repayment and monetary damages where a healthcare service provider seeks reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician that has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with such service provider; the federal False Claims Act, which attaches per-claim liability and potentially treble damages to the filing of false claims for federal payment; the federal prohibition on beneficiary inducements. Many states have also adopted similar laws that apply to any third-party payor including commercial plans.\nThe False Claims Act prohibits intentionally submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false or otherwise improper claims, records or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. In addition, violations of the Stark law and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also lead to liability under the federal False Claims Act. Most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act. In addition, the federal False Claims Act and some state false claims laws permit private individuals to file whistleblower lawsuits known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions on behalf of the federal or state government. Many states have passed laws similar to the federal False Claims Act that pertain to all payors, not just items or services paid for by the federal government.\nAlthough our business operations are not generally directly subject to these laws and regulations, any contract we have with a government entity requires us to comply with these laws and regulations. Further, our customers and clients are often subject to these complex laws, and any failure by us or our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability, including but not limited to criminal liability, could adversely affect demand for our or our client\u2019s services, and could force us to expend significant capital and other resources to address the failure. Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services with government clients violate these laws and regulations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our government client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving not only government clients but also all clients doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our or our client\u2019s business or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability and negatively affect our business. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes complex and open to a variety of interpretations.\n\u2022\nHIPAA and Other Healthcare-Related Privacy and Data Security Requirements. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the privacy and security of personal health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA, established privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of protected health information. Health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and most providers are \u201cCovered Entities\u201d subject to HIPAA. With respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, we are directly subject to the privacy regulations established under HIPAA, or the Privacy Rule, and the security regulations established under HIPAA, or the Security Rule, and the data security breach notification regulations established under HIPAA, or the Breach Notification Rule. In addition, our health plan customers, or payors, are considered Covered Entities and are required to enter into written agreements with us, known as Business Associate Agreements, under which we are considered to be a \u201cBusiness Associate\u201d and that require us to safeguard protected health information and restrict how we may use and disclose such information. Both Covered Entities and Business Associates are subject to direct oversight and audit by the Department of Health and Human Services.\nViolations of HIPAA could result in civil fines of up to $60,226 per violation ($1,806,757 per violation if not timely corrected) and a maximum civil penalty of $1,806,757 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement, as well as criminal penalties. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights actively enforces the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule. Additionally, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nWe may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation and enforcement. Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs associated with compliance. Noncompliance may result in litigation, civil penalties, fines and/or settlements.\nSome payors and clearinghouses interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do. Where payors or clearinghouses require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of a successful transaction, we seek to comply with their interpretations.\nIn addition to the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and/or health information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we might be required to comply with them. Failure by us to comply with any applicable state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties. Such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain customers and attract new customers.\n\u2022\nNon-Healthcare-Specific Privacy and Data Security Laws. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, retention, use, and disclosure of personal information. In addition to HIPAA, we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations related to privacy and information security, including those promulgated under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and various state laws regulating the use and security of personal information. Those laws, rules, and regulations include requirements such as reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect personal information or providing appropriate notice to consumers about how their personal information will be used or disclosed. State legislatures have been actively considering and enacting new laws addressing data security, security breach notification, and privacy. For example, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act were all enacted recently and will become operative in 2023. (Some provisions have already become operative.) These areas may present implementation challenges, could be an enforcement priority for the state regulators, and could generate increased lawsuits by consumers and other individuals. Our management believes that we are currently operating in compliance with these areas of law. However, continued compliance with these evolving laws, rules and regulations regarding the privacy, security and protection of our customers\u2019 data, or the implementation of any additional privacy and security rules and regulations, could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us.\n\u2022\nMedicare and Medicaid Regulatory Requirements. We have contracts with insurance carriers who offer Medicare Managed Care (also known as Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part C) and Medicaid Managed Care benefits plans. We also have contracts with insurance carriers who offer Medicare prescription drug benefits (also known as Medicare Part D) plans. The activities of the Medicare plans are regulated by the CMS, the federal agency that provides oversight of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Medicaid Managed Care plans are regulated by both CMS and the individual states where the plans are offered. Some of the activities that we might perform, such as the enrollment of beneficiaries, may be subject to CMS and/or state regulation, and such regulations may force us to change the way we do business or otherwise restrict our ability to provide services to such plans. Moreover, the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is increasingly complex.\n\u2022\nFinancial Services-Related Laws and Rules. Financial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards, some of which might impact our operations and subject us, our vendors, and our customers to liability as a result of the payment distribution and processing solutions we offer. Although we do not act as a bank, we offer solutions that involve banks, or vendors who contract with banks and other regulated providers of financial services. As a result, we might be impacted by banking and financial services industry laws, regulations, and industry standards, such as licensing requirements, solvency standards, requirements to maintain the privacy and security of nonpublic personal financial information, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance limits. In addition, our patient billing and payment distribution and processing solutions might be impacted by payment card association operating rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with applicable payment processing rules or requirements, we might be subject to fines and changes in transaction fees and may lose our ability to process credit and debit card transactions or facilitate other types of billing and payment solutions. Moreover, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing House are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association and to various federal laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic funds transfers, and these rules and laws might impact our billing and payment solutions. Further, our solutions might impact the ability of our payor customers to comply with state prompt payment laws. These laws require payors to pay healthcare claims meeting the statutory or regulatory definition of a \u201cclean claim\u201d within a specified time frame.\n\u2022\nInsurance Broker Laws. Insurance laws in the United States are often complex, and states have broad authority to adopt regulations regarding brokerage activities. Our business's regulatory oversight generally also includes activity governing the selection and payment of insurance products and the licensing of insurance brokers and our wholly owned subsidiary, BenefitStore, Inc., is an insurance agency. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage related services in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.\n\u2022\nERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), regulates how employee benefits are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefits plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor as well as the federal courts. In some circumstances, and under certain customer contracts, we might be deemed to have assumed duties that make us an\nERISA fiduciary, and thus be required to carry out our operations in a manner that complies with ERISA in all material respects. We believe that our current operations do not render us subject to ERISA fiduciary obligations, and therefore that we are in material compliance with ERISA and that any such compliance does not currently have a material adverse effect on our operations. However, there can be no assurance that continuing ERISA compliance efforts or any future changes to ERISA will not have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nThird-Party Administrator Laws. Numerous states in which we do business have adopted regulations governing entities engaged in third-party administrator (\u201cTPA\u201d), activities. TPA regulations typically impose requirements regarding enrollment into benefits plans, claims processing and payments, and the handling of customer funds. Changes in state regulations could result in us being obligated to comply with such regulations, which might require us to obtain additional licenses to provide TPA services in such states.\nPotential regulatory requirements placed on our software, services, and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new service types, and impair the function or value of our existing service types.\nOur products and services are and are likely to continue to be subject to increasing regulatory requirements in a number of ways. As these requirements proliferate, we must change or adapt our products and services to comply. Changing regulatory requirements might render our services obsolete or might block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new services. This might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply or to further develop our products and services. It might also make introduction of new product or service types more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate. It might even prevent introduction by us of new products or services or cause the continuation of our existing products or services to become unprofitable or impossible.\nPotential government subsidy of services similar to ours, or creation of a single payor system, might reduce customer demand.\nRecently, entities including brokers and U.S. federal and state governments have offered to subsidize adoption of online benefits platforms or clearinghouses. In addition, federal regulations have been changed to permit such subsidy from additional sources subject to certain limitations. To the extent that we do not qualify or participate in such subsidy programs, demand for our services might be reduced, which may decrease our revenue. In addition, prior proposals regarding healthcare reform have included the concept of creation of a single payor for healthcare insurance. This kind of consolidation of critical benefits activity could negatively impact the demand for our services.\nOur services present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft, or other similar illegal behavior by our associates with respect to third parties.\nAmong other things, certain services offered by us involve collecting payment information from individuals, and this frequently includes check and credit card information. Even though we do not handle direct payments, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties, commit identity theft, or otherwise gain access to their data or funds. If any of our associates take, convert, or misuse such funds, documents, or data, we could be liable for damages, and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed. Moreover, if we fail to adequately prevent third parties from accessing personal and/or business information and using that information to commit identity theft, we might face legal liabilities and other losses than can have a negative impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital and/or increase our borrowing costs, and we may still incur substantially more debt, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nIn December 2018, we issued $240.0 million aggregate principal of 1.25% convertible senior notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) due December 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $121.1 million aggregate principal of Notes outstanding. The Notes may limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; limit our flexibility to plan for or react to, changes in our business and industry; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. Further, the indenture governing the Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in any future debt instruments existing at the time, some of which may be secured indebtedness.\nServicing our debt and preferred dividends requires a significant amount of cash, and we might not have or be able to obtain sufficient cash to pay our substantial debt or required dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $121.1 million aggregate principal of Notes outstanding. We also had the ability to borrow an aggregate of $50.0 million under our current credit facility, all of which would be secured debt. Further, holders of our redeemable preferred stock are entitled to dividends of 8% per year, payable quarterly, which is approximately $6.4 million per year as of December 31, 2021, if paid in cash rather than in kind. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business might not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt timely. In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. In addition, our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We might not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default and acceleration of our debt obligations.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, and any required repurchase of the Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event any conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. In addition, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes (and unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), or if we are required to repurchase the Notes due to a fundamental change, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash or repurchase the Notes with cash, both of which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes upon a conditional conversion feature being triggered, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe Notes are effectively subordinated to our secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our senior, secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after the senior, secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There might not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding. The indenture governing the Notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt, nor does it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities. All our indebtedness, including the Notes, must be repaid before our stockholders would receive anything in a liquidation.\nIf we fail to meet our current credit facility\u2019s financial covenants, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur current credit facility contains financial covenants. If at any point we fail to comply with the financial covenants, the lenders can demand immediate repayment of our outstanding balance and deny future borrowings under the credit facility. This could have a negative impact on our liquidity, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes and adversely affecting our business.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would diminish our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. Furthermore, the indenture prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes and the indenture. These and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the Notes.\nThe conversion of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. The Notes may in the future become convertible at the option of the holders of the Notes prior to December 15, 2023 under certain circumstances as provided in the indenture governing the Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe capped call transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes might not turn out to be effective in reducing dilution, and might adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Notes, we paid approximately $33.0 million to enter into capped call transactions with certain purchasers or their affiliates (the \u201cOption Counterparties\u201d). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If our stock price is less than $53.17 upon conversion of the Notes, the capped calls will have no effect and we will get no benefit from the cash we paid to enter into the capped calls. Furthermore, if our stock is above $89.98 per share upon conversion of the Notes, the capped calls will not completely eliminate the dilution from Note conversion.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Option Counterparties entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. This activity could have increased (or reduced the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes at that time.\nIn addition, the Option Counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the price of our common stock or the Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the price of our common stock or the Notes will depend in part on the market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchase it.\nThe stock market historically has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. As a result of this volatility, you might not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchase it. From our initial public offering in September 2013 through March 3, 2022, the per share trading price of our common stock has been as high as $77.00 and as low as $6.09. It might continue to fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nany major change in our management;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to the sale of health insurance;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans, or commercial relationships;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors, or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Additionally, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock and those underlying the Notes eligible for future sale.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the market perception that such sales and issuances may occur could reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock or equity-linked securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of 33,460,545 shares of common stock outstanding. As of December 31, 2021, there also were outstanding options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) to purchase 3,416,131 shares of our common stock that, if exercised or vested, as applicable, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale, subject in some cases to Rule 144. We have also registered an aggregate of 2,050,954 shares of our common stock that we may issue or sell under our stock plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, unless they are held by \u201caffiliates\u201d, as that term is defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes. There are also shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) that are convertible into an aggregate of 5,333,334 shares of our common stock. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and might require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new products and services or enhance our existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we might need to engage in equity or additional debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any additional debt financing secured by us could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which might make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we might not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock may dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders, adversely impact the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the outstanding shares of our Preferred Stock were convertible into an aggregate of 5,333,334 shares of our common stock. Additional shares of our common stock may also be issued to the holders of our Preferred Stock in the event we make payment of the regular quarterly dividend on the Preferred Stock in kind, instead of in cash. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all holders of our common stock and any positive book value per share of our common stock, and would increase the number of publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock. The fact that our stockholders can sell a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds though the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nOur preferred stockholders have significant rights and preferences over the holders of our common stock that could limit us from taking certain corporate actions, and as a result affect our business, operating results, and the market price of our common stock.\nOur preferred stockholders are entitled to a quarterly dividend equal to 8.0% per annum, payable in cash or in kind, before any dividends are paid on our common stock. Our preferred stockholders are also entitled to participate in and receive any dividends declared or paid on our common stock on an as-converted basis. No dividends may be paid on our common stock unless full participating dividends are concurrently paid to our preferred stockholders. Our preferred stockholders also have a claim against our assets senior to the claim of the holders of our common stock in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up.\nOur preferred stockholders are generally entitled to vote with our common stockholders on all matters submitted for a vote of the common stockholders (voting together with the common stockholders as one class) on an as-converted basis. In addition, the following matters require the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class: (1) the authorization, creation, or issuance of any securities of the Company having rights, preferences, or privileges senior to or on a parity with any of the rights, preferences, or privileges of the Preferred Stock; (2) effecting any alteration, repeal, change, or amendment of the rights, privileges, or preferences of the Preferred Stock; (3) amendments, modifications or repeal of any provision of the Company\u2019s charter or bylaws in a manner adverse to the Preferred Stock; (4) changes in the authorized number of directors of the Company to a number greater than 10 individuals; (5) effecting any transaction between the Company and any of its affiliates (except for certain circumstances); (6) declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution with respect to any Company capital stock at any time the Company has any indebtedness outstanding; (7) incurring any indebtedness in excess of $500 million (including existing indebtedness and excluding lease obligations), or encumbering or granting a security interest in all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets in connection with any such indebtedness (except existing security interests); or (8) agreeing or consenting to any of the foregoing actions.\nAs long as not less than 60% of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock originally issued remain outstanding, the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, will have the right at any election of directors to elect (A) two directors if the board consists of nine or fewer directors; or (B) three directors if the board consists of 10 directors. At any time, such director may be removed with or without cause only by the affirmative vote or written consent of a majority of the holders of the Preferred Stock entitled to elect such director. In addition, while they have these rights to appoint directors, we may not expand the size of our board to greater than 10 directors without the consent of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.\nThe foregoing rights of our preferred stockholders could, while the Preferred Stock is outstanding, limit us from obtaining future financings or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities, and as a result may adversely affect our business, operating results, and the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders. These choice of forum provisions could limit the ability of stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or associates.\nUnless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, our amended and restated bylaws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the Court of Chancery, will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other associates to the Company or our stockholders; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Since the choice of forum provisions are only applicable to \u201cthe fullest extent permitted by applicable law\u201d, as provided in our bylaws, the provisions do not designate the Court of Chancery as the exclusive forum for any derivative action or other claim for which the applicable statute creates exclusive jurisdiction in another forum. As such, the choice of forum provisions do not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other associates, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other associates. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon future appreciation in its value, if any. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions might also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nOur Board of Directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 14149, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "BNFT"}
