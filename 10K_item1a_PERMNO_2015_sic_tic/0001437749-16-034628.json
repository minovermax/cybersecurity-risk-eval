RISK FACTORS\nOur recent emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business loans has increased our credit risk.\nBeginning in 2009, we changed our business strategy to become less reliant upon one- to four-family lending and emphasize commercial business and commercial real estate lending. To support this strategy, we have hired additional commercial real estate and commercial loan officers with commercial lending experience, as well as enhanced our back office monitoring and loan administration with additional personnel. We are now performing the underwriting analysis of such loans in-house versus contracting with an outside third party in past years. We have also purchased whole commercial business and commercial real estate loans from other institutions and participated in commercial business and commercial real estate loans originated by other institutions in the past. Although we do not actively seek to participate in or purchase such loans from other financial institutions, we evaluate opportunities on a case by case basis if they present themselves.\nWe have increased our origination of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans during the last five years, and we intend to continue to grow our portfolio of commercial real estate loans, as well as increase our portfolio of commercial business loans, in the near term, subject to market conditions. At March 31, 2016, commercial real estate loans totaled $78.1 million, or 35.1% of total loans, compared to $21.0 million, or 11.7% of total loans, at March 31, 2011. At March 31, 2016, commercial business loans and lines of credit outstanding totaled $20.4 million, or 9.2% of total loans, compared to $19.4 million, or 10.8% of total loans, at March 31, 2011. We have increased our origination of commercial business loans over the last few years to replace the commercial business loans we have charged-off due to poor asset quality or lost to other financial institutions based upon market terms. We expect additional growth in our commercial business lending portfolio as we continue to originate more of such loans and retain them.\nCommercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, a downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. See - \u201cOur entry into commercial real estate and commercial business lending may result in higher losses on our loans,\u201d below.\nOur entry into commercial real estate and commercial business lending may result in higher losses on our loans.\nBeginning in 2011, the level of our delinquent and non-performing commercial and commercial real estate (including commercial construction) loans began to increase, particularly in our portfolio of loan participations and purchased loans. During fiscal 2012, nonperforming loans increased $5.8 million, or 354%, to $7.4 million at March 31, 2012. Of the $7.4 million in nonperforming loans, $6.3 million were related to commercial real estate and commercial business loans. As a result of this large increase, we experienced charge-offs of $3.2 million and $2.3 million in fiscal 2013 and 2014, respectively. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans accounted for over 90% of the charge-offs in both those fiscal years. Through workout and charge-offs, as well as a thorough review of the commercial loan portfolio, we were able to reduce our nonperforming commercial loans from $6.3 million at March 31, 2012 to $2.8 million at March 31, 2016. Commercial real estate loans comprised $2.7 million of the $5.1 million in nonperforming loans at March 31, 2016, while commercial business loans accounted for $122,000 of that total. The $2.7 million in nonperforming commercial real estate loans consisted of two loans to the same borrower.\nGiven our recent emphasis on commercial business and commercial real estate lending, and that our portfolio of commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans is not seasoned, we have a limited loss history with which to measure the level of risk in our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios. In addition, with our in-house underwriting function for commercial business and commercial real estate loans being relatively new, we have a limited history on which to assess the effectiveness of our commercial business and commercial real estate loan underwriting processes and personnel. Delinquencies and loan losses related to our commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans could increase more than we have provided for in our allowance for loan losses as we continue to emphasize this type of lending activity. See - \u201cOur recent emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business loans has increased our credit risk,\u201d above.\nA portion of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans is comprised of non-owner occupied (investor) properties, which increases the credit risk on this portion of our loan portfolio.\nA portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by non-owner occupied one- to four-family properties, which we refer to as \"investor loans\". At March 31, 2016, $27.9 million of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in our portfolio, or 12.5% of total loans, were comprised of investor loans. We acquired approximately $17.1 million of investor loans in connection with our acquisition of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. in September 2015. There is a greater credit risk inherent in non-owner occupied properties, than in owner-occupied since the repayment of these loans may depend, in part, on the successful management of the property and/or the borrower\u2019s ability to lease the unit or units of the property. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing these loans or the revenues derived from these properties, which could affect the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan.\nIn addition, we have limited experience with the performance of the investor loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. See - \u201cWe have limited experience with the performance of loans acquired in our recent acquisitions of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. and Fraternity Community Bancorp, Inc. Certain of our estimates related to accounting for acquired loans may differ from actual results\" below regarding risks associated with our recent acquisition of these and other loans.\nWe have limited experience with the performance of loans acquired in our recent acquisitions of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. and Fraternity Community Bancorp, Inc. Certain of our estimates related to accounting for acquired loans may differ from actual results.\nIt is difficult to assess the future performance of loans recently added to our portfolio as part of our acquisitions of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. and Fraternity Community Bancorp, Inc. because our relatively limited experience with such loans does not provide us with a significant history from which to judge future collectability. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nIn addition, under generally accepted principles for business combinations, there is no loan loss allowance initially recorded for acquired loans, which are recorded at net fair value on the acquisition date. This net fair value generally includes embedded loss estimates for acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality. These estimates are based on projections of expected cash flows for these problem loans, which in many cases rely on estimates deriving from the liquidation of collateral.\nIf the estimates we have made regarding the performance of loans we have acquired are inadequate, the fair value estimates may exceed the actual collectability of the balances, and this may result in the related loans being considered by us as impaired, which would result in a reduction in interest income. The tangible book value we record is based in part on these estimates, and if fair value estimates differ from actual collectability, then subsequent earnings may also differ from original estimates. Measures of tangible book value and earnings impact of business combinations are frequently used in evaluating the merits and value of business combinations. Numerous assumptions and estimates are integral to purchased loan accounting, and actual results could be different from prior estimates.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance for loan losses. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are established through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income.\nThe unseasoned nature of much of our commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans increases the risk that our allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses without significant additional provisions. See - \u201cOur recent emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business loans has increased our credit risk,\u201d and - \u201cOur entry into commercial real estate and commercial business lending may result in higher losses on our loans,\u201d above. At March 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses was $1.7 million, or 33.7% of non-performing loans.\nIn addition, if the loans we have acquired in our recent acquisitions of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. and Fraternity Community Bancorp, Inc. do not perform as we have estimated, our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate. See - \u201cWe have limited experience with the performance of loans acquired in our recent acquisitions of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. and Fraternity Community Bancorp, Inc. Certain of our estimates related to accounting for acquired loans may differ from actual results,\" above.\nMaterial additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will become effective for us on January 1, 2021. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nOur recent acquisitions of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. and Fraternity Community Bancorp, Inc. involve integrations and other risks.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges including: our ability to integrate the branches and operations we acquire, and the associated internal controls and regulatory functions, into our current operations; our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired branches and to successfully retain and manage the loans we acquire; our ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in geographic areas we have not previously served. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of acquired branches would not adversely affect our existing profitability; that we would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business; that we would be able to compete effectively in the market areas served by acquired branches; or that we would be able to manage any growth resulting from the transaction effectively. We face the additional risk that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or within the time period expected. Finally, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values and therefore, may result in dilution of our book and tangible book value per share.\nHistorically low interest rates and/or changes in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nWhile it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels over the past several years through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities, the Federal Reserve Board raised the federal funds rate by a quarter point on December 17, 2015. As a general matter, our net interest income has been adversely impacted by the low rate environment that has existed over the past several years, however, at this point it is uncertain what impact the December rate increase might have on our net interest income (the difference between interest income we earn on our assets and the interest expense we pay on our liabilities). It is also uncertain when the Federal Reserve Board might raise or lower the federal funds rate in the future. If interest rates rise it may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. If rates remain low it could create deflationary pressures, which while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand (which would also decrease our ability to generate noninterest income through the sale of loans into the secondary market and related fees for continuing to service those sold loans, particularly SBA loans sold) and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. In addition, as market interest rates rise, we will have competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits. Because interest rates we pay on our deposits would be expected to increase more quickly than the increase in the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income would be adversely affected.\nWe also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities.\nWe could potentially recognize goodwill impairment charges.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had $6.8 million of goodwill related to acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of Hamilton Bank be compared to the carrying amount of the Bank\u2019s net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the Bank is less than book value, an expense may be required to write-down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value. We test for impairment of goodwill during February of each year. As a result of impairment testing performed during February 2016, no impairment charge was recorded. However, future declines in our banking franchise value could result in goodwill impairment expense that is material to our earnings.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry within our market area is intense. In our market area we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and broader range of deposit and loan products offered by our competition may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets and profitability. We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our ability to successfully implement our business plan, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the future.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is coming not only from local markets but from technology oriented financial services (\u201cFinTech) companies, which are subject to limited regulation. They offer user friendly front-end, quick turnaround times for loans and other benefits. While Hamilton is evaluating FinTech companies with the possibility of developing relationships for efficiency in processing and/or as a source of loans and other business, we cannot limit the possibility that our customers or future prospects will work directly with a FinTech company instead. This could impact our growth and profitability going forward.\nA worsening of economic conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur markets have been adversely impacted by the severe national economic recession of 2008 and 2009. Recovery by many businesses has been impaired by lower consumer spending. If the Federal Reserve Board increases the federal funds rate, higher interest rates would likely result, which may reduce our loan originations, and housing markets and U.S. economic activity would be negatively affected.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends on the general economic conditions in the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our commercial real estate and construction and consumer loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Almost all of our loans are to borrowers located in the greater Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area or secured by collateral located in the greater Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area.\nA further deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged delay in economic recovery in the market areas we serve, in particular the greater Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u25cf\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u25cf\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u25cf\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline further in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u25cf\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us ; and\n\u25cf\nThe amount of our low-cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic condition could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, our primary federal regulators, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Hamilton Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nIncome from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses or charges with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations which would negatively affect our earnings.\nWe generally sell in the secondary market all residential mortgage loans that we originate with terms over 10 years on a servicing released basis, earning noninterest income in the form of gains on sale. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans available for sale. In addition to interest rate levels, weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. We do sell loans in the secondary market with recourse based upon delinquency or breach of customary representations and warranties we provide to the buyers. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers can require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase. Since 2009, we have outsourced the loan processing and underwriting functions with respect to loans that we intend to sell in the secondary market to a third-party company. While we review each application to ensure compliance with secondary market standards, there may be some additional risk in outsourcing these functions to a third party rather than utilizing our own employees. If our relationship with this third-party loan processor/underwriter were to terminate, we would incur additional costs to undertake such functions using our own employees. In addition, if our current third-party arrangement were to be terminated, we may not be able to process and underwrite the same volume of loans for the secondary market using our own employees, which could result in reduced income.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives may affect our business activities and increase operating costs.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending, funding practices, capital, and liquidity standards. Bank regulatory agencies are expected to be more active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders. In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes may also increase our compliance costs and affect our business and operations. Moreover, the FDIC sets the cost of our FDIC insurance premiums, which can affect our profitability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of insured depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directs changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandates the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies, requires originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, stipulates regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repeals restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. There is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in continued increases in regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense.\nNew laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, some legal and regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. There may be negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation as described above and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.\nSystems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, inadequate or failed internal processes, customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We depend upon data processing, software, communication, and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the Internet, and we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite instituted safeguards, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. Information security risks have increased significantly due to the use of online, telephone and mobile banking channels by clients and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. Our technologies, systems, networks and our clients\u2019 devices have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, the theft of client assets through fraudulent transactions or disruption of our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and we could be exposed to claims from customers. While we maintain a system of internal controls and procedures, any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk and liquidity risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models used to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 13642, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "HBK"}
