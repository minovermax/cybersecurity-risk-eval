Risk Factors\nWe are at an early stage of development of our hosting business, currently have limited sources of revenue, and may not become profitable in the future.\nAlthough we began generating revenue from hosting operations when our first co-hosting facility came online on February 2, 2022, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties of a new business, including the risk that we may never develop, complete development or market any of our proposed services.\nDuring the building of our co-hosting operations, we determined that it would be beneficial to our stockholders to focus more of our resources on building our co- hosting operations than on expanding our mining operations. Accordingly, in December 2021, we began selling our crypto mining equipment. On March 9, 2022, we ceased all crypto mining operations and completed the sale of all crypto mining equipment in service. We have no plans to return to crypto mining operations in the future.\nAccordingly, we have only a limited history upon which an evaluation of our prospects and future performance can be made. Hosting revenues includes only fees from access to space and electricity and not maintenance or other services provided by us. Direct costs of sales from hosting includes operations, maintenance and power related costs. However, any increased hosting revenue or decreased costs, for instance, as a result of pricing power, economies of scale and additional services provided, or any decrease in demand for our hosting services, for example as a result of increased regulation on cryptoasset mining of our hosting customers or a significant decrease in cryptoasset prices, will significantly change the terms on which we are able to enter into additional agreements necessary to expand our business and thus impact the results of our hosting revenues and direct hosting costs.\nWe intend to reduce the impact of such variability on our hosting revenue and hosting costs by entering into long term contracts with the goal of having one blue chip anchor tenant that has signed a 3-5 year long-term contract at each site and filling the rest of the facility with customers with 18-36 month terms.\nThe actual results may vary significantly from the plans set forth above and we make no representations with respect thereto. If we are unable to successfully implement our development plan or to increase our generation of revenue, we will not become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations. Furthermore, our proposed operations are subject to all business risks associated with new enterprises. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the expansion of a business, operation in a competitive industry, and the continued development of advertising, promotions and a corresponding customer base. There can be no assurances that we will operate profitably.\nOur success depends on external factors in the cryptomining industry.\nAll of our current customers are crypto miners. The cryptomining industry is subject to various risks which could adversely affect our current customers\u2019 ability to continue to operate their businesses, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022ongoing and future government or regulatory actions that could effectively prevent our customers\u2019 mining operations, with little to no access to policymakers and lobbying organizations in many jurisdictions;\n\u2022a high degree of uncertainty about cryptoassets\u2019 status as a \u201csecurity,\u201d a \u201ccommodity\u201d or a \u201cfinancial instrument\u201d in any relevant jurisdiction which may be subject our customers to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, and other penalties;\n\u2022banks or financial institutions may close the accounts of businesses engaging in cryptoasset- related activities as a result of compliance risk, cost, government regulation or public pressure;\n\u2022use of cryptoassets in the retail and commercial marketplace is limited;\n\u2022extreme volatility in the market price of cryptoassets that may harm our customers financial resources, ability to meet their contractual obligations to us or cause them to reduce or cease mining operations\n\u2022use of a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets or the rigors of listing requirements for securities creating higher potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of the ledger due to a control event;\n\u2022concentrated ownership, large sales of cryptoassets, or distributions or redemptions by vehicles invested in cryptoassets could have an adverse effect on the demand or, and market price of, such cryptoasset;\n\u2022our customers could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto, rapidly changing technology or methods of, rules of, or access to, platforms;\n\u2022the number of cryptoassets awarded for solving a block in a blockchain could decrease which may adversely affect our customers\u2019 incentive to expend processing power to solve blocks and/or continue mining and our customers may not have access to resources to invest in increasing processing power when necessary in order to in order to maintain the continuing revenue production of their mining operations;\n\u2022our customers may face third parties' intellectual property claims or claims relating to the holding and transfer of cryptoassets and their source code, which, regardless of the merit of any such action, could reduce confidence in some or all cryptoasset networks\u2019 long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer cryptoassets;\n\u2022contributors to the open-source structure of the cryptoasset network protocols are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the protocol and may lack incentive to properly monitor and upgrade the protocols;\n\u2022a disruption of the Internet on which our customers\u2019 business of mining cryptoassets is dependent;\n\u2022decentralized nature of the governance of cryptoasset systems, generally by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear leadership structure or authority, may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a network from overcoming emergent obstacles; and\n\u2022security breaches, hacking, or other malicious activities or loss of private keys relating to, or hack or other compromise of, digital wallets used to store our customers\u2019 cryptoassets could adversely affect their ability to access or sell their cryptoassets or effectively utilize impacted platforms.\nEven if we are able to diversify our customer base, negative impacts to the cryptomining industry may negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are a development stage company with a small management team and are subject to the strains of ongoing development and growth, which will place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results could be materially harmed.\nWe may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Further, we cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully identify emerging trends and growth opportunities in this business sector and we may lose out on opportunities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations.\nWe have an evolving business model which is subject to various uncertainties.\nAs cryptoassets and blockchain technologies become more widely available, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve. Future regulations may require our co-hosting customers to change their businesses in order to comply fully with federal and state laws regulating cryptoasset (including Ethereum and Bitcoin) mining. In order to stay current with the industry, our business model may need to evolve as well. From time to time, we may modify aspects of our business model relating to our strategy. We cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital needed to grow our business.\nWe expect to need to raise substantial additional capital to expand our operations, pursue our growth strategies and to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely affect our existing operations.\nIf we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of debt likely would have priority over the holders of common stock on order of payment preference. We may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends to our shareholders, or take other actions. We may also be required to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interests of our stockholders.\nAny disruption of service experienced by certain of our third-party service providers, or our ineffective management of relationships with third-party service providers could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\nWe rely on several third-party service providers for services that are essential to our business model, the most important of which are our suppliers of power, electrical equipment, building materials, and construction services. If these third parties experience difficulty providing the services we require, or if they experience disruptions or financial distress or cease operations temporarily or permanently, it could make it difficult for us to execute our operations. If we are unsuccessful in identifying or finding highly qualified third-party service providers, or if we fail to negotiate cost-effective relationships with them or if we are ineffective in managing and maintaining these relationships, it could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\nCertain natural disasters or other external events could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects\nWe may experience disruptions due to mechanical failure, power outage, human error, physical or electronic security breaches, war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, pandemics, hurricane, flood and other natural disasters, sabotage and vandalism. Our systems may be susceptible to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Such disruptions could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects.\nVarious actual and potential conflicts of interest may be detrimental to stockholders.\nCertain conflicts of interest may exist, or be perceived to exist, between certain of our directors or officers and us. Mr. Cummins and certain of our directors have other business interests to which they also must devote time, resources and attention. These other interests may conflict with such officer\u2019s or director\u2019s interest in us, including conflicting with interests in allocating resources, time and attention to our business and impacting decisions made on our behalf with respect to such entities, their affiliates or competitors.\nOur Service Providers (other than SparkPool which discontinued its operations as of June 2022) and Bitmain, operate businesses related to crypto mining. Specifically, GMR and Bitmain actively mine cryptoassets. Valuefinder consults with and advise other cryptoasset-related companies. Our Service Providers\u2019 and Bitmain\u2019s interest in their\nown business and that of entities they advise may conflict with our interests and may impact the advice provided to us or our competitors such that our business, operations and financial results may be negatively impacted.\nWe do not have specific procedures in place with respect to potential conflicts of interest, however, in determining to engage with potential competitors and entities with whom our officers or directors may have relationships, we considered the risks and risk mitigation factors, including requiring that transactions with entities that are related to our officers and directors be approved or ratified by our Audit Committee. Recognizing that Mr. Cummins holds over 23% of our common stock, and our Service Providers, other than Xsquared which no longer operates, hold between 3.2% and 7.5% of our common stock, all of them have a financial interest in the success of our operations. Additionally, none of our Service Providers or Bitmain operate in the co-hosting business.\nWe have also have more than a majority of independent directors on our Board in order to ensure that there are limitations on the risks of conflicts of interest impacting Board level decisions. Because we are not engaging in the crypto mining business at this time and focusing on expanding our co-hosting business, the effects of any such risks of conflicts of interest are limited in scope. We expect that as our co-hosting business continues to grow, the risks of conflicts of interest will become more limited over time. We cannot, however, guarantee that the conflicts of interest described above, or other future conflicts of interest, will not manifest in advice or decisions that negatively impact our financial results and our operations.\nThe loss of any of our management team, our inability to execute an effective succession plan, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business.\nOur success and future growth will depend to a significant degree on the skills and services of our management team. We will need to continue to grow our management team in order to alleviate pressure on our existing team and in order to continue to develop our business. If our management team, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we fail to execute an effective contingency or succession plan with the loss of any member of our management team, the loss of such management personnel may significantly disrupt our business.\nThe loss of key members of our management team could inhibit our growth prospects. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management and operating personnel. As we continue to develop and expand our operations, we may require personnel with different skills and experiences, and who have a sound understanding of our business and the cryptoasset industry. The market for highly qualified personnel in this industry is very competitive and we may be unable to attract such personnel. If we are unable to attract such personnel, our business could be harmed.\nWe may depend upon outside advisors who may not be available on reasonable terms as needed.\nTo supplement the business experience of our officers and directors, we may be required to employ technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, or other consultants or advisors. Our management, with our board of directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) approval in certain cases, without any input from stockholders will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore, it is anticipated that such persons may be engaged on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us. In the event we consider it necessary to hire outside advisors, we may elect to hire persons who are affiliates, if they are able to provide the required services.\nCOVID-19 or any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere may adversely affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 virus has had unpredictable and unprecedented impacts in the United States and around the world.\nChina has prohibited the shipment of cryptoasset related products in and out of its borders, which could negatively impact our ability to receive mining equipment from China-based suppliers on behalf of our customers. Third-party manufacturers, suppliers, sub-contractors and customers have been and could continue to be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, restrictions on employees\u2019 ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the\nmagnitude of such effects on our supply chain, shipments of parts for our customers\u2019 existing miners may be delayed. As our customers\u2019 equipment requires repair or becomes obsolete and requires replacement, our and their ability to obtain adequate replacements or repair parts from their manufacturer may therefore be hampered. To the extent we are providing maintenance and repair services to our customers, our ability to provide such services may also be hampered by supply chain and labor disruptions. If not resolved quickly, supply chain disruptions could negatively impact our operations.\nThe implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. The economic effects of the pandemic and any recovery and resulting societal changes, including the impact of current labor shortages in the United States, are currently not predictable, and the future financial impacts could vary from current projections.\nIf our co-hosting customers determine not to use our co-hosting facility, our co-hosting operations may suffer from significant losses.\nWe have material customer concentration in our co-hosting business. We have entered into contracts with five customers to utilize our first co-hosting facility in North Dakota. These five customers account for 100% of the revenue from our first co-hosting facility (100 MW). These customers have also contracted for 85MW of power at our second co-hosting facility once it is completed and operational. In addition, in July 2022, the Company entered into a five-year hosting contract with Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. for 200 MW of mining capacity. As a result of this arrangement, the Company will supply Marathon with 90 MW of hosting capacity at its facility being built in Texas and at least 110 MW of hosting capacity at its second facility to be built in North Dakota. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of customers.\nAdditionally, as a result of the risks our crypto mining customers face, it is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our services that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for the products and services of these customers. Should some or all of our co-hosting customers suffer from harm or loss due to a set of circumstances, their businesses could be negatively impacted or prevented. Further, our contracts with these customers permit them to terminate our services at any time (subject to notice and certain other provisions).\nIf any of our customers experience declining mining operations for any reason or determine to stop utilizing our co-hosting facilities, we could be pressured to reduce the prices we charge for our services or we could lose a major customer. Any such development could have an adverse effect on our margins and financial position, and would negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe liquidity of our common stock is uncertain; the limited trading volume of the common stock may depress the price of such stock or cause it to fluctuate significantly.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on Nasdaq, there has been a limited public market for the common stock and there can be no assurance that a more active trading market will develop. As a result, shareholders may not be able to sell shares of common stock in short time periods, or possibly at all. The absence of an active trading market may cause the price per share of the common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future; this volatility may affect the price at which you could sell our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on an investment in our securities:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022relative success of our competitors;\n\u2022our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us and the market for our co-hosting facilities;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022our ability to continue to expand our operations;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our business or our industry;\n\u2022commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the borrowing of additional debt;\n\u2022the volume of shares of common stock available for public sale pursuant to an effective registration statement or exemption from registration requirements;\n\u2022any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, international currency and crypto currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our common stock, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our common stock also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, which may limit the return our shareholders realize on their investment.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will invest future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, holders of our common stock may not receive any return on their investment in our common stock unless and until the value of such common stock increases and they are able to sell such shares of common stock, and there is no assurance that any of the foregoing will occur.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock value.\nWe are a newly public company and are now required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"SOX\"), which requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will not be required to make our first assessment of our internal control over financial reporting until the year following this annual report, (i.e., the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023). To comply with the\nrequirements of being a public company, we will need to upgrade our systems, including information technology, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting, finance and legal staff.\nWe currently have material weaknesses in the design or operation of our internal controls, which could adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. We have not yet designed and/or implemented user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties that would adequately restrict user and privileged access to the financially relevant systems and data to appropriate personnel. We also do not currently have an internal control system that identifies critical processes and key controls. We are in the process of remediating such material weaknesses and there can be no assurance as to when or if we will fully remediate such material weaknesses.\nOur efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future and comply with the certification and reporting obligations under Sections 302 and 404 of SOX. Any failure to maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in our implementation or improvement of our internal controls over financial reporting could result in material misstatements that are not prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interest because of the future issuance of additional equity in our company.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of capital stock in our company, resulting in the dilution of current stockholders\u2019 relative ownership. Our board and stockholders have approved an employee incentive plan and a non-employee director incentive plan. We have reserved 15,166,666 shares of our common stock for future issuance under our plans. Such conversions and issuances would also result in dilution of current stockholders\u2019 relative ownership.\nOn January 6, 2022, we and Antpool entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement of 1.21 Gigawatts, LLC pursuant to which we and Antpool will own 80% and 20%, respectively, of 1.21 Gigawatts. Antpool\u2019s interest in each such entity will be convertible by it at any time into a number of shares of our common stock equal to Antpool\u2019s capital contribution in connection with the acquisition of such interests divided by $1.25 (or $7.50 after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split). Antpool\u2019s potential ownership of our common stock is dependent on its capital contributions to 1.21 Gigawatts which in turn will depend on which projects are approved by us and Antpool and the costs associated therewith. Accordingly, we cannot predict the amount of Antpool\u2019s potential ownership of our common stock.\nOn January 14, 2022, we granted an aggregate of 1,791,666 restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) to three consultants, consisting of 125,000 RSUs to Roland Davidson, who acts as our Executive Vice President of Engineering, 416,666 RSUs to Nick Phillips, our Executive Vice President of Hosting and Public Affairs, and 1,250,000 RSUs to Etienne Snyman, who acts as our Executive Vice President of Power.\nWe may also issue other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for equity in our company in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions or future sales of our securities.\nProvisions in our Articles, our Bylaws, and Nevada law may discourage a takeover attempt even if a takeover might be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our Articles and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us if we have become a publicly traded company. Provisions of our Articles and Bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our Articles authorize our Board to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our Board can authorize and issue shares of\npreferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our other series of capital stock. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company. Additionally, our Bylaws establish limitations on the removal of directors and on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings.\nFor a more complete understanding of these provisions, please refer to the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Articles and Bylaws.\nThough we are not currently, in the future we may become subject to Nevada\u2019s control share law. A corporation is subject to Nevada\u2019s control share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and it does business in Nevada or through an affiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a \u201ccontrolling interest\u201d which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third; (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority; or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.\nThe effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share law.\nIf control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for the redemption of such stockholder\u2019s shares. Nevada\u2019s control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation.\nIn addition to the control share law, Nevada has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for two years after the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless our Board approves the combination in advance or thereafter by both the Board and 60% of the disinterested stockholders. For purposes of Nevada law, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the two previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term \u201cbusiness combination\u201d is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation\u2019s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders.\nThe effect of Nevada\u2019s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of us from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our Board.\nWe may not be able to maintain the listing of our Common Stock on Nasdaq, which may adversely effect the flexibility of holders of Common Stock to resell their securities in the secondary market.\nOur Common Stock is presently listed on Nasdaq, which requires us to meet certain conditions to maintain our listing status. If the Company is unable to meet the continued listing criteria of Nasdaq and the Common Stock became delisted, trading of the Common Stock could thereafter be conducted in the over-the-counter markets in the OTC Pink, also known as \u201cpink sheets\u201d or, if available, on another OTC trading platform.\nWe cannot assure you that we will meet the criteria for continued listing, in which case the Common Stock could become delisted. Any such delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the loss of confidence in our financial stability by suppliers, customers and employees. Investors would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate market quotations for, the Common Stock, as the liquidity that Nasdaq provides would no longer be available to investors. In addition, the failure of our Common Stock to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq could adversely impact the market price for the Common Stock and our other securities, and we could face a lengthy process to re-list the Common Stock, if we are able to re-list the Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our common stock, its trading price and volume could decline.\nWe expect the trading market for our common stock to be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business or our industry. As a new public company, we have only minimal research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If we do not expand securities or industry analyst coverage, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 89986, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "APLD"}
