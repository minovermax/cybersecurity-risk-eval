RISK FACTORS\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss. We originate commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgage loans primarily within our market area. We have developed and implemented a lending strategy that focuses on residential real estate lending as well as servicing commercial customers, including increased emphasis on commercial and industrial lending and commercial deposit relationships. Commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u00b7 Commercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u00b7 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business.\n\u00b7 Consumer Loans. Consumer loans are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation, damage or loss.\nAny downturn in the real estate market or local economy could adversely affect the value of the properties securing the loans or revenues from the borrowers\u2019 businesses thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease. Our loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We therefore may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Material additions to our allowance for loan losses also would materially decrease our net income, and the charge-off of loans may cause us to increase the allowance. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.\nIf a significant portion of any future unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities were to become other than temporarily impaired with credit losses, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings, and our capital ratios would be adversely impacted. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $420.2 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of those securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) in future periods and result in realized losses.\nWe analyze our investment securities quarterly to determine whether, in the opinion of management, any of the securities have OTTI. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities is determined to have OTTI and is credit loss related, we will recognize a charge to our earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made, and our capital ratios will be adversely impacted. Generally, a fixed income security is determined to have OTTI when it appears unlikely that we will receive all of the principal and interest due in accordance with the original terms of the investment. In addition to credit losses, losses are recognized for a security having an unrealized loss if the Company has the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before collection of the principal amount.\nIf dividends are not paid on our investment in the FHLBB, or if our investment is classified as other-than-temporarily impaired, our earnings and/or shareholders\u2019 equity could decrease. We own common stock of the FHLBB to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLBB\u2019s advance program. There is no market for our FHLBB common stock. There can be no assurance that such dividends will be declared in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the Federal Home Loan Banks also will not cause a decrease in the value of the FHLBB stock held by us.\nIt is possible that the capitalization of a Federal Home Loan Bank, including the FHLBB, could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero. Consequently, we believe that there is a risk that our investment in FHLBB common stock could be deemed other-than-temporarily impaired at some time in the future, and if this occurs, it would cause our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity to decrease by the after-tax amount of the impairment charge.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. In addition, as market interest rates rise, we will have competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits, which will result in a decrease of our net interest income.\nWe also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities.\nChanges in the national and local economy may affect our future growth possibilities. Our current market area is principally located in Hampden County, Massachusetts. Our future growth opportunities depend on the growth and stability of our regional economy and our ability to expand our market area. The continued downturn in our local economy may limit funds available for deposit and may negatively affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans on a timely basis, both of which could have an impact on our profitability.\nDramatic declines in the housing market, with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures, have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many loans have declined and may continue to decline. The ongoing economic recession, reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other. This market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity. We do not believe these difficult conditions are likely to improve in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market and economic conditions on us, our customers and the other financial institutions in our market. As a result, we may experience increases in foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies, as well as more restricted access to funds and decrease in our stock price.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services. We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel. We have employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President and General Counsel and change of control agreements with several other senior executive officers, and the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers and key personnel could impair our ability to continue to develop our business strategy.\nCompetition in our primary market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and originate loans. We operate in a competitive market for both attracting deposits, which is our primary source of funds, and originating loans. Historically, our most direct competition for deposits has come from savings and commercial banks. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. We also face additional competition from internet-based institutions, brokerage firms and insurance companies. Competition for loan originations and deposits may limit our future growth and earnings prospects.\nWe operate in a highly-regulated environment that is subject to extensive government supervision and regulation, which may interfere with our ability to conduct business and may adversely impact the results of our operations. We are subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation that govern nearly all aspects of our operations and can have a material impact on our business. Financial regulatory authorities have significant discretion regarding the supervision, regulation and enforcement of banking laws and regulations.\nFinancial laws, regulations and policies are subject to amendment by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. Changes to statutes, regulations or policies, including changes in the interpretation of regulations or policies, could materially impact our business. These changes could also impose additional costs on us and limit the types of products and services that we may offer our customers. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and the failure to comply with any law, regulation or policy could result in sanctions by financial regulatory agencies, including civil monetary penalties, private lawsuits, or reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such violations, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur. See the section titled, \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in ITEM 1. Business.\nSince the 2008 global financial crisis, financial institutions have been subject to increased scrutiny from Congress, state legislatures and federal and state financial regulatory agencies. Recent changes to the legal and regulatory framework have significantly altered the laws and regulations under which we operate. These changes may reduce our ability to effectively compete in attracting and retaining customers. The passage and continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, among other laws and regulations, has increased our costs of doing business and resulted in decreased revenues and net income. The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations could also have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment and our ability to conduct business. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the federal financial regulatory agencies. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that future changes in laws, regulations and policies will not adversely affect our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect our business. Federal and state regulatory agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, an agency were to determine that the financial, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or violates any law or regulation, such agency may take certain remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to correct any deficiency. Remedial or enforcement actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced against a bank, to direct an increase in the bank\u2019s capital, to restrict the bank\u2019s growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against a bank\u2019s officers or directors, and to remove officers and directors. In the event that the FDIC concludes that, among other things, our financial conditions cannot be corrected or that there is an imminent risk of loss to our depositors, it may terminate our deposit insurance. The OCC, as the supervisory and regulatory authority for federal savings associations, has similar enforcement powers with respect to our business. The CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties, if it finds that we offer consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws.\nIf we were unable to comply with future regulatory directives, or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject, then we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, MOUs, and other regulatory enforcement actions. Such supervisory actions could, among other things, impose greater restrictions on our business, as well as our ability to develop any new business. We could also be required to raise additional capital, or dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed time period, or both. Failure to implement remedial measures as required by financial regulatory agencies could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could trigger one or more of the remedial actions described above. The terms of any supervisory action and associated consequences with any failure to comply with any supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility and overall financial condition.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements. The Bank and Westfield Financial are each subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which each of the Bank and Westfield Financial must maintain. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In light of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements contained in the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated by the Basel Committee and implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, we may be required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards. The ultimate impact of the revised capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including the treatment and implementation by the U.S. banking regulators. These requirements, however, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company, as part of its strategic plans, periodically considers potential acquisitions. The risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions including, among other things: our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and avoid unanticipated costs relating to the merger, the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the potential disruption of our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing business, the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the impairment of relationships with the acquired company\u2019s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management. These risks may prevent us from fully realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or cause the realization of such benefits to take longer than expected.\nA breach of information security, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business and impact our earnings. We depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, and over the internet. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite existing safeguards, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. If information security is breached or difficulties or failures occur, despite the controls we and our third party vendors have instituted, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us, reputational harm or damages to others. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of insurance coverage, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings.\nWe continually encounter technological change and the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could hurt our business. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89262, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "WNEB"}
