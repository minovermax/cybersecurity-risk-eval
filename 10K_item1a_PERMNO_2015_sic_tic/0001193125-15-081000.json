{"cik": "1359555", "company": "Pendrell Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks below address some of the factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Patents and Monetization Activities\nSuccess of our licensing efforts depends on our ability to enter into new license agreements or otherwise enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur licensing business depends on sustaining and growing our IP licensing revenue. IP licensing revenues are dependent on our ability to enter into new license agreements with, or otherwise enforce our intellectual property rights against, users of our patented inventions. If users refuse to sign or renew license agreements, we may need to resort to litigation or other measures to compel the payment of fair consideration, which may or may\nnot be effective. This risk applies not only to new license agreements, but to existing license agreements with fixed expiration dates. If we fail to sign or renew license agreements on terms that are favorable to us or obtain favorable outcomes through litigation or other enforcement actions, our business opportunity could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to expand our portfolios, revenue opportunities from our IP monetization efforts will be limited.\nPatents have finite lives. Our IP portfolio currently consists of patents that expire between 2015 and 2033, as well as patent applications. Our portfolio has an average remaining life of approximately 6.2 years. If we fail to develop or acquire new patentable inventions prior to the expiration of our patents, our licensing opportunities will be limited.\nWe may have a limited number of prospective licensees.\nThe patent portfolios that we own and may acquire in the future may be applicable to only a limited number of prospective licensees. As such, if we are unable to enter into licenses with this limited group, and if we fail to expand the breadth and depth of our patent portfolios, licensing revenue will be adversely impacted.\nOur licensing cycle is lengthy, and our licensing efforts may be unsuccessful.\nThe process of licensing to customers can be lengthy, sometimes spanning a number of years. We expect to incur significant legal and sales expenses prior to entering into license agreements and generating license revenues. We also expect to spend considerable resources educating prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement with us. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue is generated. Moreover, if our portfolio is not demonstrably applicable to prospective licensees\u2019 products or services, whether due to poor quality, lack of breadth or otherwise, parties may refuse to enter into license agreements.\nEnforcement proceedings may be costly and ineffective and could lead to impairment of our IP assets.\nWe may choose to pursue litigation or other enforcement action to protect our intellectual property rights, such as the litigation we initiated against the ContentGuard Defendants. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex, and might require cooperation of inventors and others who are unwilling or unable to assist with enforcement. Litigation also involves several stages, including the potential for a prolonged appeals process. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. We may receive a ruling or judgment, or we may enter into licenses or settlement agreements that might compel us to revalue the IP assets that we are enforcing or the goodwill value of our enforcing subsidiary, which in turn might result in a reduction to the financial statement carrying value of such assets through a corresponding impairment charge which would adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position. Enforcement actions will likely divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations. In certain cases, we may conclude that these costs and risks outweigh the potential benefits that would arise from successful enforcement, in which event we may opt not to pursue enforcement.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if our inventions are not incorporated into products.\nOur licensing revenues have been generated from manufacturers and distributors of products that incorporate our patented inventions. Our business prospects could be negatively impacted if prospective licensees do not include our inventions in their products, or if they later modify their products to eliminate use of our inventions.\nAs we incorporate our IP into product offerings, we could face new risks.\nAs we seek to commercialize our IP through product offerings, we could face risks that we have not previously confronted, including IP infringement risks, product liability risks, and other risks. The outcome of\nproceedings arising from or related to such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. In addition, any growth associated with product offerings is largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of any new product offerings, including our ability to continually modernize our products and bring those products to market. If any products we offer are not commercially successful, our results of operation and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe may not recover costs of our commercialization activities.\nWe may incur significant costs to advance our commercialization efforts that might not be recovered if our efforts are unsuccessful. Our failure to recover such costs could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nFuture innovations could make our inventions obsolete.\nOur success depends, in part, on continued demand for products that incorporate our patented inventions. Changes in technology or customer requirements could render our patented inventions obsolete or unmarketable.\nChallenges to the validity or enforceability of our key patents could significantly harm our business.\nOur assets include patents that are integral to our business and revenues. Prospective licensees or competitors may challenge the validity, scope, enforceability and ownership of our patents. Their challenges may include review requests in the relevant patent and trademark office, such as the inter partes review and covered business method proceedings initiated by certain ContentGuard Defendants. Review proceedings are costly and time-consuming, and we cannot predict their outcome or consequences. Such proceedings may narrow the scope of our claims or may cancel some or all of our claims. If some or all of our patent claims are canceled, we could be prevented from enforcing or earning future revenues from such patents. Even if our claims are not canceled, enforcement actions against alleged infringers, such as our litigation against the ContentGuard Defendants, may be stayed pending resolution of reviews, or courts or tribunals reviewing our patent claims could make findings adverse to our interests based on facts presented in review proceedings. Irrespective of outcome, review challenges may result in substantial legal expenses and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from our other business operations. Adverse decisions could impair the value of our inventions or result in a loss of our proprietary rights and may adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nDelays in issuance of patents could harm our business.\nWe may acquire and pursue additional patents and related intellectual property rights. If we do, our patent applications will add to a growing number of patent applications, which may result in longer delays in obtaining approval of such patent applications. The application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from new patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license or enforce patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nChanges in patent law could adversely impact our business.\nPatent laws may continue to change, and may alter protections afforded to owners of patent rights, impose additional enforcement risks, increase the costs of enforcement, or increase our licensing cycles. For instance, during 2013, legislative initiatives were introduced to address perceived patent abuses by non-practicing entities. Although legislation was not enacted, similar legislation has been introduced in 2015. Even if legislative initiatives do not directly impact our business, such initiatives might encourage manufacturers to infringe our IP rights, lengthen our licensing cycles, increase the likelihood that we will litigate to enforce our IP rights, or make it more difficult and expensive to license our patents or enforce our patents against parties using our inventions without a license. Moreover, increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes which increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions.\nChanges of interpretations of patent law could adversely impact our business.\nOur success in review and enforcement proceedings relies in part on the historically consistent application of patent laws and regulations. Interpretations of patent laws and regulations by the courts and applicable regulatory bodies have evolved, and may continue to evolve, particularly with the introduction of new laws and regulations. Changes or potential changes in judicial interpretation could have a negative impact on our ability to monetize our patent rights.\nRisks Related to our Acquisition Activities\nWe may over-estimate the value of assets or businesses we acquire.\nWe make investments from which we intend to generate a return. We estimate the value of these investments prior to acquisition, using both objective and subjective methodologies. If we over-estimate such value, we may not generate desired returns on our investment, or we may need to adjust the value of the investments to fair value and record a corresponding impairment charge, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nWe may not capitalize on acquired assets.\nEven if we accurately value the investments we make, we must succeed in generating a return on the investments. For instance, our subsidiaries that own IP rights must commercialize, license, or otherwise monetize the IP rights in order to generate a return on our investment. Our success in generating a return, particularly with respect to our IP rights, depends on effective efforts of our employees and outside professionals, which typically requires complex analysis, the exercise of sound professional judgment and effective education of prospective licensees and customers. If we do not generate desired returns on our investments or if we are compelled to adjust the value of the investments to fair value and record a corresponding impairment charge, it could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nWe may pursue other acquisition or investment opportunities that do not yield desired results.\nWe intend to continue investigating potential acquisitions that support our business objectives and strategy. Acquisitions are time-consuming, complex and costly. The terms of acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, we may incur significant transactional expenses, regardless of whether or not acquisitions are consummated. Moreover, the integration of acquired companies prompts significant challenges, and we can provide no assurances that the integration of acquired businesses with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits we anticipate from such acquisitions. Investigating businesses and assets and integrating newly acquired businesses or assets may be costly and time-consuming, and such activities could divert our attention from other business concerns. In addition, we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, the assumption or incurrence of contingent liabilities, possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances, any of which could negatively impact our financial position. We might not be successful in integrating acquired businesses, and might not achieve desired revenues and cost benefits.\nWe rely on representations, warranties and opinions from third parties that might not be accurate.\nWhen we acquire assets or businesses or establish relationships with inventors or strategic partners, we may rely on representations and warranties made by third parties. We also may rely on opinions of lawyers and other professionals. We may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such representations, warranties and opinions are made. By relying on these representations, warranties and opinions, we may be exposed to unforeseen liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nOur financial and operating results have been and may continue to be uneven.\nOur operating results may fluctuate and, as such, our operating results are difficult to predict. You should not rely on quarterly or annual comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate during any period or that could adversely affect our operating results include the timing of license, sales and consulting agreements, compliance with such agreements, the terms and conditions for payment under those agreements, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, changes in demand for products that incorporate our inventions, the time period between commencement and completion of license negotiations or enforcement proceedings, revenue recognition principles, and changes in accounting policies.\nOur revenues have not and may not offset our operating expenses.\nThrough 2014, we developed and expanded our business by acquiring IP assets, developing new solutions and products and expanding the reach and scope of our IP business. We also incurred expenses to hire new personnel, including employees for IP services, patent research and analysis, development of reporting systems and general and administrative functions and to pay legal fees for IP enforcement activities. As a result, our costs exceeded our revenues, and although we have recently scaled back our expansion efforts, we anticipate that costs will continue to exceed revenues until and unless we generate additional revenue from our existing assets. If we are not successful in generating revenue that is sufficient to offset our expenses, our financial position will be negatively impacted.\nFailure to effectively manage the composition of our employee base could strain our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on continued contributions of our key managers and employees, many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled personnel, and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively, both individually and as a group. Recently, we terminated the employment of certain individuals (including IP consultants) who we believe were redundant or unnecessary to advance our current and anticipated business initiatives. If we misjudged our ongoing personnel needs or lose any of our remaining senior managers or key personnel, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our clients or licensees, which could slow our growth or result in a loss of business. Moreover, if we fail to manage the composition of our employee base effectively or otherwise strain our relationships with our personnel, our business and financial results may be materially harmed.\nOur provision of IP-related services could result in professional liability that may damage our reputation.\nOur provision of IP-related services typically involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment. As a result, we are subject to the risk of professional liability. If a client questions the quality of our work, the client could threaten or bring a lawsuit to recover damages or contest its obligation to pay fees. Litigation alleging that we performed negligently or breached any other obligations to a client could expose us to legal liabilities and, regardless of outcome, could be costly, distract our management and damage our reputation.\nRights of minority shareholders may limit future value.\nThe governing documents for certain subsidiaries which we do not wholly own describe certain actions that require unanimous consent of their respective shareholders. For instance, we entered into a voting agreement with Time Warner that survives so long as Time Warner holds a material interest in ContentGuard, and which requires the prior written consent of both us and Time Warner before ContentGuard commits its patents to a standards body or patent pool, grants any license that facilitates copyright theft, undertakes certain litigation, or sells or transfers any material patents free of these three restrictions. Historically, shareholder consent requirements have not adversely impacted our business, but circumstances could change. Moreover, we may enter into investments in the future that involve similar or more restrictive governance provisions. If our interests\nand the interests of our partners or other shareholders in these investments diverge, we may be unable to capitalize on business opportunities or prevented from realizing favorable returns on investments.\nIf we need financing and cannot obtain financing on favorable terms, our business may suffer.\nWe have relied on revenues from clients and licensees and existing cash reserves to finance our operations. If we deploy a significant portion of our capital or encounter unforeseen difficulties in the future that deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated, we may need to obtain additional financing. Financing might not be available on favorable terms, if at all, may dilute our existing shareholders, and may prompt us to pursue structural changes that could impact shareholder concentration and liquidity. If we fail to obtain additional capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture changes in standards, rules, practices or interpretation may impact our financial results.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretations by the SEC and various accounting bodies. In addition, we are subject to various taxation rules in many jurisdictions. The existing taxation rules are generally complex, voluminous, frequently changing and often ambiguous. Changes to existing taxation rules, changes to the financial accounting standards, or any changes to the interpretations of these standards or rules, or changes in practices under these standards and rules, may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, other contractual relationships and patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our confidential and proprietary information, our technology and our intellectual property. We cannot be certain that these protections have not been and will not be breached, that we will be able to timely detect unauthorized use or transfer of our trade secrets or intellectual property, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If we are unable to detect in a timely manner the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary or other confidential information or if we are unable to enforce our rights under our agreements or applicable laws, the misappropriation of such information could harm our business.\nRisks Related to the Tax Losses Generated from Our Former Satellite Communications Business\nOur ability to benefit from our United States federal income tax loss carryforward may be impacted by changes in the tax laws.\nWe have substantial historical net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for United States federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2014, we had NOL carryforwards of approximately $2.5 billion. A significant portion of our NOL was triggered when we disposed of our satellite business. We believe these NOLs can be carried forward to offset certain future taxable income. However, our ability to benefit from these historical NOLs is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the loss carryforward period. The NOL carryforward period begins to expire in 2025 with the bulk of the NOLs expiring in 2032. If the tax laws are amended to limit or eliminate our ability to carryforward the NOLs for any reason, or to lower income tax rates, the value of the NOLs may be significantly reduced.\nAn Ownership Change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code may significantly limit Pendrell\u2019s ability to use its NOLs to offset future taxable income.\nOur use of our NOLs will be significantly limited if we undergo a Tax Ownership Change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Broadly, Pendrell will have a Tax Ownership Change if, over a three-\nyear testing period, the portion of all stock of Pendrell, by value, owned by one or more 5% shareholder increases by more than 50 percentage points. For purposes of this test, shareholders that own less than 5% of the stock of Pendrell are aggregated into one or more separate \u201cpublic groups,\u201d each of which is treated as a 5% shareholder. In general, shares traded within a public group are not included in the Tax Ownership Change test. Despite our adoption of certain protections against a Tax Ownership Change (such as our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan), we cannot control the trading activity of our significant shareholders. If significant shareholders divest their shares in a manner or at times that do not account for the loss-limiting provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations adopted thereunder, a Tax Ownership Change could occur. If a Tax Ownership Change occurs when the value of the Class A Common Stock is low, Pendrell will be permanently unable to use most of its NOLs.\nOur NOLs cannot be used to offset the Personal Holding Company tax.\nThe Internal Revenue Code imposes an additional tax on the undistributed income of a Personal Holding Company (\u201cPHC\u201d). In general, a corporation will be classified as a PHC if more than 50% of its outstanding shares, measured by value, are owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals and at least 60% of its adjusted gross income is Personal Holding Company Income (\u201cPHCI\u201d). Broadly, PHCI includes income such as dividends, interest, rents and royalties, among others. We believe that any income from ContentGuard\u2019s resolution of its claims against the ContentGuard Defendants will be classified as PHCI. Due to the significant number of shares held by our largest shareholders, we must continually assess share ownership of Pendrell and each of our consolidated subsidiaries, including ContentGuard. To date neither Pendrell, as the parent company, nor any of our consolidated subsidiaries have incurred a PCH tax obligation. However, it is possible that action or inaction by significant shareholders could result in a future PHC tax liability. The PHC tax, which is in addition to the income tax, is currently levied at 20% of the net PHCI not distributed to the corporation\u2019s shareholders.\nOur NOLs cannot be used to completely offset the Alternative Minimum Tax or other taxes.\nWe may also be subject to the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) in a year in which we have net taxable income because the AMT cannot be completely offset by available NOLs, as losses carried forward generally can offset no more than 90% of a corporation\u2019s AMT liability. In addition, our federal NOLs will not shield us from foreign withholding taxes, state and local income taxes, or revenue-based taxes incurred in jurisdictions that impose such taxes.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent on the generation of future taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income before the expiration of the carry forward period attributable to the NOLs, which begin to expire in 2025. We did not generate taxable income in 2013 or 2014 and we may not generate sufficient taxable income in future years to use the NOLs before they begin expiring.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock could depress the market price.\nThe average trading volume of our Class A common stock is low in relation to the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell shares in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nA sale of a large number of shares by our largest shareholders could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nA small number of our shareholders hold a majority of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, which is convertible at the option of the holders into Class A common stock. The sale or prospect of the\nsale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe interests of our controlling shareholder may conflict with the interests of other Class A holders.\nEagle River Satellite Holdings, LLC, together with its affiliates Eagle River Investments, LLC, Eagle River, Inc. and Eagle River Partners, LLC (collectively, \u201cEagle River\u201d) controls approximately 65% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Eagle River has control over the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to our governing documents, the adoption or prevention of mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets, or control changes. Eagle River is not restricted or prohibited from competing with us.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASD Marketplace Rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nEagle River controls approximately 65% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq Global Select Market corporate governance standards, and therefore may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq Global Select Market corporate governance requirements, including (i) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement that the compensation of officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors, and (iii) the requirement that director nominees be selected, or recommended for the board of directors\u2019 selection, by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process. We do not currently rely on any of these exemptions, but reserve the right to do so in the future. If we choose to do so, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq Global Select Market corporate governance requirements.\nOur Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, as well as certain provisions in our restated articles of incorporation, may discourage takeovers, which could affect the rights of holders of our Class A common stock.\nOur Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to act as a deterrent against any person or group acquiring or otherwise obtaining beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of our securities without the approval of our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation require us to take all necessary and appropriate action to protect certain rights of our common shareholders, including voting, dividend and conversion rights and rights in the event of a liquidation, merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets. Our articles of incorporation also provide that we will not avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of those rights by charter amendment, entry into an inconsistent agreement or reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution or the issuance or sale of securities. The rights protected by these provisions of the articles of incorporation include our Class B common shareholders\u2019 right to ten votes per share on matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and option to convert each share of Class B common stock into one share of Class A common stock. The provisions of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan and our articles of incorporation could discourage takeovers of our company, which could adversely affect the rights of our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 86270, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "PCOA"}
