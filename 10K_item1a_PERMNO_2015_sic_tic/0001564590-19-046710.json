RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be significantly harmed.\nRisks Related to Faneuil\nFaneuil is subject to uncertainties regarding healthcare reform that could materially and adversely affect that aspect of our business.\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) into law, which has affected comprehensive health insurance reform, including the creation of health insurance exchanges, among other reforms. A portion of Faneuil\u2019s healthcare business relates to providing services to health insurance exchanges in various states, and Faneuil believes that there may be significant opportunities for growth in this area. President Trump has disclosed that a key initiative for his Presidency is to repeal or substantially change the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, new tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 (\u201cTax Reform Law\u201d) includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d which could lead to fewer enrollments in healthcare exchanges. It is unclear whether further changes that President Trump has planned to the Affordable Care Act will be enacted, or if enacted changes will affect Faneuil\u2019s business. Further significant changes to, or repeal of, the Affordable Care Act could materially and adversely affect that aspect of Faneuil\u2019s business.\nEconomic downturns and reductions in government funding could have a negative effect on Faneuil\u2019s business.\nDemand for the services offered by Faneuil has been, and is expected to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond its control, including economic conditions. During economic downturns, the ability of both private and governmental entities to make expenditures may decline significantly. We cannot be certain that economic or political conditions will be generally favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting Faneuil as a whole, or key industry segments targeted by Faneuil. In addition, Faneuil\u2019s operations are, in part, dependent upon state government funding. Significant changes in the level of state government funding could have an unfavorable effect on Faneuil\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFaneuil\u2019s business involves many program-related and contract-related risks.\nFaneuil\u2019s business is subject to a variety of program-related risks, including changes in political and other circumstances, particularly since contracts for major programs are performed over extended periods of time. These risks include changes in personnel at government authorities, the failure of applicable government authorities to take necessary actions, opposition by third parties to particular programs and the failure by customers to obtain adequate financing for particular programs. Due to these factors, losses on a particular contract or contracts could occur, and Faneuil could experience significant changes in operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.\nThe diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention to the integration of the RDI Acquisition could adversely affect Faneuil\u2019s day-to-day business.\nThe integration of the RDI Acquisition may place a significant burden on Faneuil management and internal resources. The diversion of Faneuil management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect Faneuil\u2019s financial results.\nDelays in the government budget process or a government shutdown may adversely affect Faneuil\u2019s cash flows and operating results.\nFaneuil derives a significant portion of its revenue from state government contracts and programs. Any delay in the state government budget process or a state government shutdown may result in Faneuil incurring substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts, or the delay or cancellation of key programs in which Faneuil is involved, which could materially adversely affect Faneuil\u2019s cash flows and operating results.\nFaneuil faces intense competition. If Faneuil does not compete effectively, its business may suffer.\nFaneuil faces intense competition from numerous competitors. Faneuil primarily competes based on quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, and established customer service capabilities, as its services relate to toll collection, customer contact centers, and employee staffing. Faneuil may not be able to compete effectively on all these fronts or with all of its competitors. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and service offerings may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of the services Faneuil provides. To remain competitive, Faneuil must respond to new technologies and enhance its existing services, and we anticipate that it may have to adjust the pricing for its services to stay competitive on future responses to proposals. If Faneuil does not compete effectively, its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFaneuil\u2019s dependence on a small number of customers could adversely affect its business or results of operations.\nFaneuil derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of customers. For additional information regarding Faneuil customer concentrations, see \u201cPart IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules - Note 4. Concentration Risks.\u201d We expect the largest customers of Faneuil to continue to account for a substantial portion of its total net revenue for the foreseeable future. Faneuil has long-standing relationships with many of its significant customers. However, because Faneuil customers generally contract for specific projects or programs with a finite duration, Faneuil may lose these customers if funding for their respective programs is discontinued, or if their projects end and the contracts are not renewed or replaced. The loss or reduction of, or failure to renew or replace, any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce Faneuil revenue and cash flows. Additionally, many Faneuil customers are government entities, which can unilaterally terminate or modify the existing contracts with Faneuil without cause and penalty to such government entities in many situations. If Faneuil does not replace them with other customers or other programs, the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations.\nThe recovery of capital investments in Faneuil contracts is subject to risk.\nIn order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts, Faneuil may be required to make significant capital investments to perform its services under the contract, such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software. The net book value of such assets, including intangible assets, could be impaired, and Faneuil earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract, reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons including, but not limited to, a client\u2019s merger or acquisition, divestiture of assets or businesses, business failure or deterioration, or a client\u2019s exercise of contract termination rights.\nFaneuil\u2019s business could be adversely affected if Faneuil\u2019s clients are not satisfied with its services.\nFaneuil\u2019s business model largely depends on the ability to attract new work from existing clients. Faneuil\u2019s business model also depends on client relationships, understanding client needs, and delivering specific solutions to meet such needs. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by Faneuil or a subcontractor or with the type of services or solutions delivered, Faneuil could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client\u2019s dissatisfaction with Faneuil\u2019s services could lead to the termination of that work or damage Faneuil\u2019s ability to obtain additional work from that client. Also, negative publicity related to Faneuil\u2019s client relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage Faneuil\u2019s business by affecting its ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients.\nFaneuil\u2019s dependence on subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect it.\nIn some cases, Faneuil relies on and partners with third-party subcontractors as well as third-party equipment manufacturers to provide services under its contracts. To the extent that Faneuil cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials, its performance, according to the terms of the customer contract, may be impaired. If the amount Faneuil is required to pay for subcontracted services or equipment exceeds the amount Faneuil has estimated in bidding for fixed prices or fixed unit price contracts, it could experience reduced profit or losses in the performance of these contracts with its customers. Also, if a subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services, equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, Faneuil may be required to purchase the services, equipment or materials from another source at a higher price. This may reduce the expected profit or result in a loss of a customer contract for which the services, equipment or materials were needed.\nPartnerships entered into by Faneuil as a subcontractor with third parties who are primary contractors could adversely affect its ability to secure new projects and derive a profit from its existing projects.\nIn some cases, Faneuil partners as a subcontractor with third parties who are the primary contractors. In these cases, Faneuil is largely dependent on the judgments of the primary contractors in bidding for new projects and negotiating the primary contracts, including establishing the scope of services and service levels to be provided. Furthermore, even if projects are secured, if a primary contractor is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated terms of the primary contract for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, the customer may terminate or modify the primary contract, which may reduce Faneuil profit or cause losses in the performance of the contract. In certain instances, the subcontract agreement includes a \u201cPay When Paid\u201d provision, which allows the primary contractor to hold back payments to a subcontractor until they are paid by the customer, which has negatively impacted Faneuil cashflow.\nIf Faneuil or a primary contractor guarantees to a customer the timely implementation or performance standards of a program, Faneuil could incur additional costs to meet its guaranteed obligations or liquidated damages if it fails to perform as agreed.\nIn certain instances, Faneuil or its primary contractor guarantees a customer that it will implement a program by a scheduled date. At times, they also provide that the program will achieve or adhere to certain performance standards or key performance indicators. Although Faneuil generally provides input to its primary contractors regarding the scope of services and service levels to be provided, it is possible that a primary contractor may make commitments without Faneuil\u2019s input or approval. If Faneuil or the primary contractor subsequently fails to implement the program as scheduled, or if the program subsequently fails to meet the guaranteed performance standards, Faneuil may be held responsible for costs to the client resulting from any delay in implementation, or the costs incurred by the program to achieve the performance standards. In most cases where Faneuil or the primary contractor fails to meet contractually defined performance standards, Faneuil may be subject to agreed-upon liquidated damages. To the extent that these events occur, the total costs for such program may exceed original estimates, and cause reduced profits, or in some cases a loss for that program.\nAdequate bonding is necessary for Faneuil to win new contracts.\nFaneuil is often required, primarily in its toll and transportation programs, to provide performance and surety bonds to customers in conjunction with its contracts. These bonds indemnify the customer should Faneuil fail to perform its obligations under the contracts. If a bond is required for a particular program and Faneuil is unable to obtain an appropriate bond, Faneuil cannot pursue that program. The issuance of a bond is at the surety\u2019s sole discretion. Moreover, due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally, bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional costs. There can be no assurance that bonds will continue to be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Any inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new work could harm Faneuil\u2019s business.\nInterruption of Faneuil data centers and customer contact centers could negatively impact Faneuil\u2019s business.\nIf Faneuil was to experience a temporary or permanent interruption at a customer contact center due to natural disaster, casualty, operating malfunction, cyber-attack, sabotage or any other cause, Faneuil might be unable to provide the services it is contractually obligated to deliver. This could result in Faneuil being required to pay contractual damages to some clients or to allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts. Notwithstanding disaster recovery and business continuity plans and precautions instituted to protect Faneuil and Faneuil clients from events that could interrupt delivery of services, there is no guarantee that such interruptions would not result in a prolonged interruption in service, or that such precautions would adequately compensate Faneuil for any losses it may incur as a result of such interruptions.\nAny business disruptions due to political instability, armed hostilities, and acts of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely affect Faneuil\u2019s financial performance.\nIf terrorist activities, armed conflicts, political instability or natural disasters, including climate change related events, occur in the United States, such events may negatively affect Faneuil operations, cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for Faneuil services, many of which depend on travel, to decline. A prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for Faneuil services, and consequently, negatively affect Faneuil\u2019s future sales and profits. Any of these events could have a significant effect on Faneuil\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFaneuil\u2019s business is subject to many regulatory requirements, and current or future regulation could significantly increase Faneuil\u2019s cost of doing business.\nFaneuil\u2019s business is subject to many laws and regulatory requirements in the United States, covering such matters as data privacy, consumer protection, healthcare requirements, labor relations, taxation, internal and disclosure control obligations, governmental affairs and immigration. For example, Faneuil is subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding the protection of consumer information commonly referred to as \u201cnon-public personal information.\u201d For instance, the collection of patient data through Faneuil\u2019s contact center services is subject to HIPAA, which protects the privacy of patients\u2019 data. These laws, regulations, and agreements require Faneuil to develop and implement policies to protect non-public personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and periodically after that. These laws, regulations, and agreements limit the ability to use or disclose non-public personal information for purposes other than the ones originally intended. Many of these regulations, including those related to data privacy, are frequently changing and sometimes conflict with existing ones among the various jurisdictions in which Faneuil provides services. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in liability for damages, fines, criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and restrictions placed on Faneuil operations. Faneuil\u2019s failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to Faneuil\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, because a substantial portion of Faneuil operating costs consists of labor costs, changes in governmental regulations relating to wages, healthcare and healthcare reform and other benefits or employment taxes could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFaneuil\u2019s profitability is dependent in part on Faneuil\u2019s ability to estimate correctly, obtain adequate pricing, and control its cost structure related to fixed \u201cprice per call\u201d contracts.\nA significant portion of Faneuil\u2019s revenues are derived from commercial and government contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes. Many of these contracts are extremely complex and require the investment of significant resources in order to prepare accurate bids and pricing based on both current and future conditions, such as the cost of labor, that could impact profitability of such contracts. Our success depends on Faneuil\u2019s ability to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to implement and service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination of such contracts\u2019 full scope and design, and negotiate adequate pricing for call center services that provide a reasonable return to our shareholders based on such estimates. Additionally, in order to attract and retain certain contracts, we are sometimes required to make significant capital and other investments to enable us to perform our services under those contracts, such as facility leases, information technology equipment purchases, labor resources, and costs incurred to develop and implement software. If Faneuil is unable to accurately estimate its costs to provide call center services, obtain adequate pricing, or control costs for fixed \u201cprice per call\u201d contracts, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure to attract and retain necessary personnel, skilled management, and qualified subcontractors may have an adverse impact on Faneuil\u2019s business.\nBecause Faneuil operates in intensely competitive markets, its success depends to a significant extent upon its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel and to subcontract with qualified, competent subcontractors. If Faneuil fails to attract, develop, motivate, retain, and effectively utilize personnel with the desired levels of training or experience, or is unable to contract with qualified, competent subcontractors, Faneuil\u2019s business will be harmed. Experienced and capable personnel remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. Additionally, regarding the labor-intensive business of Faneuil, quality service depends on the ability to retain employees and control personnel turnover. Any increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs and could decrease operating effectiveness and productivity. Faneuil may not be able to continue to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects. Faneuil\u2019s business is driven in part by the personal relationships of Faneuil\u2019s senior management team, and its success depends on the skills, experience, and performance of members of Faneuil\u2019s senior management team. Despite executing an employment agreement with Faneuil\u2019s CEO, she or other members of the management team may discontinue service with Faneuil and Faneuil may not be able to find individuals to replace them at the same cost, or at all. Faneuil has not obtained \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any member of its senior management team. The loss or interruption of the services of any key employee or the loss of a key subcontractor relationship could hurt Faneuil\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flow, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Carpets\nThe floor covering industry is highly dependent on national and regional economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and individual spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. A decline in residential or commercial construction activity or remodeling and refurbishment in Las Vegas could have a material adverse effect on Carpets business.\nThe floor covering industry is highly dependent on construction activity, including new construction, which is cyclical in nature. Historically, downturns in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, particularly in Las Vegas, have negatively impacted the floor covering industry and Carpets business. Although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities\nlagged during the recent downturns. Diminished consumer confidence in general, or specifically with respect to purchasing homes, or lack of consumer interest in purchasing a home compared to other housing alternatives due to location preferences, perceived affordability constraints or otherwise, may contribute to such a downturn. Further, changes to monetary policy or other actions by the Federal Reserve resulting in an adverse effect on interest rates (including mortgage interest rates), a downward trend in employment levels and job and wage growth, and increasing prices for available new or existing homes could lead to a decline in housing activity and negatively impact Carpets business. A significant or prolonged decline in residential/commercial remodeling or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of Carpets.\nBecause all of Carpets operations are concentrated in the Las Vegas area, it is especially subject to certain risks, including economic and competitive risks, associated with the conditions in that area and in the areas from which it draws customers.\nCarpets currently operates solely in the Las Vegas area. Due to this geographic concentration, its results of operations and financial conditions are subject to greater risks from changes in local and regional conditions, such as changes in local or regional economic conditions and unemployment rates; changes in local and state laws and regulations; a decline in the number of residents in the Las Vegas area; and changes in the local or regional competitive environment. As a result of the geographic concentration of is business, Carpets faces a greater risk of a negative impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if any of the geographic areas in which it operates is more severely impacted by any such adverse condition, as compared to other areas in the United States.\nCarpets faces intense competition in the floor covering industry that could decrease demand for its products or force it to lower prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe floor covering industry is highly competitive. Carpets competes with several home improvement stores, building materials supply houses and lumber yards, specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, and other retailers, as well as with installers. Also, it faces growing competition from online and multichannel retailers as its customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. Intense competitive pressures from one or more competitors of Carpets or the inability by Carpets to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect its prices, its margins or demand for its products and services. If it is unable to respond timely and appropriately to these competitive pressures, including through maintaining competitive locations of stores, customer service, quality and price of merchandise and services, in-stock levels, and merchandise assortment and presentation, its market share and its financial performance could be adversely affected.\nCarpets may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect its relationship with customers, its reputation, demand for its products and services and its market share.\nCarpets operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and features. The success of Carpets depends on its ability to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands promptly. All of its products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Also, long lead times for certain of its products may make it hard for it to respond quickly to changes in consumer demands. Consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of products or away from the types of products Carpets carries altogether, and Carpets future success depends, in part, on its ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.\nCarpets relies on third-party suppliers for its products. If it fails to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if its suppliers experience financial or operational difficulties, its ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet its standards could be adversely affected.\nCarpets sources, stocks and sells products from vendors, and the vendors\u2019 ability to fulfill Carpets orders reliably and efficiently is critical to its business success. Its ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy its standards for quality and the need to access products in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner is a significant challenge. The ability to access products can also be adversely affected by political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, supply disruptions, weather conditions, natural disasters, including climate change related events, shipping or logistical interruptions or costs and other factors beyond its control. If these vendors fail or are unable to perform as expected and Carpets is unable to replace them quickly, its business could suffer material adverse short- and long-term effects.\nIf Carpets fails to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality, its reputation, sales, profitability, cashflows, and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in Carpets and the Carpets brand image. As a result, its reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services could suffer and impact customer loyalty. Additionally, a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls, product liability and warranty claims. Carpets generally provides a one-year warranty on the installation of any of its products. Warranty work related directly to installation is repaired at the cost to Carpets, and product defects are generally charged back to the manufacturer.\nIf Carpets is unable to manage its installation service business effectively, it could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits, and a damaged reputation.\nCarpets acts as a general contractor to provide installation services to its customers. As such, it is subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and the quality of its installers. If Carpets fails to effectively manage these processes or provide proper oversight of these services, it could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to its reputation, which could adversely affect its business.\nThe business of Carpets is dependent in part on estimating fixed price projects correctly and completing the installations within budget. Carpets could suffer losses associated with installations on fixed price projects.\nA portion of Carpets business consists of fixed price projects that are bid for and contracted based on estimated costs. The estimating process includes budgeting for the appropriate amount of materials, labor, and overhead. At times, this work can be substantial. The ability to estimate costs correctly and complete the project within budget or satisfaction without material defect is essential. In particular, there may be additional tariffs or taxes related to any inputs and finished goods imported by Carpets. Compliance with changes in taxes, tariffs and other regulations may require Carpets to alter its sourcing and make the process of estimating fixed price projects more difficult. If Carpets is unable to estimate a project properly or unable to complete the project within budget or without material defect, it may suffer losses, which could adversely affect its reputation, business, and financial condition.\nCarpets depends upon its ability to attract, train, and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling its labor costs.\nCustomers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from associates employed by Carpets. To meet the needs and expectations of its customers, Carpets must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Its ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations or healthcare benefits. Also, Carpets competes with other retail businesses for many of its associates in hourly positions, and it invests significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. There is no assurance that Carpets will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future.\nA substantial decrease or interruption in business from Carpets significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect its business.\nA small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of Carpets net revenue. We expect that key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of Carpets net revenue for the foreseeable future. However, Carpets may lose these customers due to pricing, quality or other various issues. The loss or reduction of, or failure to renew or replace, any significant contracts with any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations. For additional information regarding customer concentrations, see \u201cPart IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules - Note 4. Concentration Risks.\u201d\nHistorically, Carpets has purchased inventory from a small number of vendors. If these vendors became unable to provide materials promptly, Carpets would be required to find alternative vendors. Management estimates they could locate and qualify new vendors in a short period of time. For additional information regarding vendor concentrations, see \u201cPart IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules - Note 4. Concentration Risks.\u201d\nRisks Related to Phoenix\nPhoenix faces intense competition in the printing industry that could decrease demand for its products or force it to lower prices.\nThe printing industry is highly competitive. Phoenix competes directly or indirectly with several established book and book component manufacturers. New distribution channels such as digital formats, the internet and online retailers and growing delivery platforms (e.g., tablets and e-readers), combined with the concentration of retailer power, pose threats and provide opportunities to traditional consumer publishing models, potentially impacting both sales volumes and pricing.\nCompetitive pressures or the inability by Phoenix to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect prices, margins or demand for products and services. If Phoenix is unable to respond timely and appropriately to these competitive pressures, from existing or new competitors, its business could be adversely affected.\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty, as well as the effects of these conditions on Phoenix\u2019s customers and suppliers, could reduce demand for or the ability of Phoenix to provide its products and services.\nEconomic conditions related to Phoenix, Phoenix\u2019s customers, and Phoenix\u2019s suppliers, could negatively impact Phoenix\u2019s business and results of operations. Phoenix has experienced, and may continue to experience, reduced demand for certain of its products and services. As a result of uncertainty about global economic conditions, including factors such as unemployment, bankruptcies, financial market volatility, sovereign debt issues, government budget deficits, tariffs, and other factors which continue to affect the global economy, Phoenix\u2019s customers and suppliers may experience further deterioration of their businesses, suffer cash flow shortages or file for bankruptcy. In turn, existing or potential customers may delay or decline to purchase Phoenix products and related services, and Phoenix\u2019s suppliers and customers may not be able to fulfill their obligations to it in a timely fashion.\nEducational textbook cover and component sales depend on continued government funding for educational spending, which impacts demand by its customers, and may be affected by changes in or continued restrictions on local, state and/or federal funding and school budgets. As a result, a reduction in consumer discretionary spending or disposable income and/or adverse trends in the general economy (and consumer perceptions of those trends) may affect Phoenix more significantly than other businesses in other industries.\nIn addition, customer difficulties could result in increases in bad debt write-offs and increases to Phoenix\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. Further, Phoenix\u2019s suppliers may experience similar conditions as its customers, which may impact their viability and their ability to fulfill their obligations to Phoenix. Negative changes in these or related economic factors could materially adversely affect Phoenix\u2019s business.\nA substantial decrease or interruption in business from Phoenix\u2019s significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect its business.\nPhoenix has significant customer and supplier concentration. For additional information regarding customer and supplier concentrations, see \u201cPart IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules - Note 4. Concentration Risks.\u201d Any significant cancellation, deferral or reduction in the quantity or type of products sold to these principal customers or a significant number of smaller customers, including as a result of Phoenix\u2019s failure to perform, the impact of economic weakness and challenges to customer businesses, a change in buying habits, further industry consolidation or the impact of the shift to alternative methods of content delivery, including digital distribution and printing, to customers, could have a material adverse effect on Phoenix business. Further, if Phoenix\u2019s significant customers, in turn, are not able to secure large orders, they will not be able to place orders with Phoenix. A substantial decrease or interruption in business from Phoenix\u2019s significant customers could result in write-offs or the loss of future business and could have a material adverse effect on Phoenix\u2019s business.\nAdditionally, Phoenix purchases certain limited grades of paper to produce book and component products. If Phoenix\u2019s suppliers reduce their supplies or discontinue these grades of paper, Phoenix may be unable to fulfill its contract obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. See \u201cPart IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules - Note 4. Concentration Risks.\u201d\nThe impact of digital media and similar technological changes, including the substitution of printed products with digital content, may continue to adversely affect the results of Phoenix\u2019s operations.\nThe industry in which Phoenix operates is experiencing rapid change due to the impact of digital media and content on printed products. Electronic delivery of information offer alternatives to traditional delivery in the form of print materials provided by Phoenix. Further improvements in the accessibility and quality of digital media, mobile technologies, e-reader technologies, digital retailing and the digital distribution of documents and data has resulted and may continue to result in increased consumer substitution away from Phoenix\u2019s printed products. Continued consumer acceptance of such digital media, as an alternative to print materials, is uncertain and difficult to predict and may decrease the demand for the Phoenix\u2019s printed products, result in reduced pricing for its printing services and additional excess capacity in the printing industry, and could materially adversely affect Phoenix\u2019s business.\nFluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials could increase Phoenix cost of sales.\nTo produce its products, Phoenix is dependent upon the availability of raw materials, including paper, ink, and adhesives, the price and availability of which are affected by numerous factors beyond its control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand for these materials and downstream products containing or using these materials;\n\u2022\nthe supply of these materials and the impact of industry consolidation;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation and taxes;\n\u2022\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the capital and credit markets;\n\u2022\nenvironmental conditions and regulations; and\n\u2022\npolitical and global economic conditions.\nAny material increase in the price of key raw materials could adversely impact Phoenix cost of sales or result in the loss of availability of such materials at reasonable prices. When these fluctuations result in significantly higher raw material costs, Phoenix\u2019s operating results are adversely affected to the extent it is unable to pass on these increased costs to its customers or to the extent they materially affect customer buying habits. Significant fluctuations in prices for paper, ink, and adhesives could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on Phoenix\u2019s business.\nAny disruption at a Phoenix production facility could adversely affect its results of operations.\nPhoenix is dependent on certain key production facilities and certain specialized machines. Any disruption of production capabilities due to unforeseen events, including mechanical failures, labor disturbances, weather or other force majeure events, at any of its principal facilities could adversely affect its business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Further, if any of the specialized equipment that Phoenix relies upon to make its products becomes inoperable, Phoenix may experience delays in its ability to fulfill customer orders, which could harm its relationships with its customers.\nPhoenix is subject to environmental obligations and liabilities that could impose substantial costs upon Phoenix.\nPhoenix\u2019s operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing emissions to air, discharge to water, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and other materials, and employee health and safety matters. As an owner and operator of real property and a generator of hazardous substances, Phoenix may be subject to environmental cleanup liability, regardless of fault, pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or analogous state laws, as well as to claims for harm to health or property or for natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. Some current or past operations have involved metalworking and plating, printing and other activities that have resulted in or could result in environmental conditions giving rise to liabilities. If Phoenix incurs significant expenses related to environmental cleanup or damages stemming from harm or alleged harm to health, property or natural resources arising from contamination or exposure to hazardous substances, Phoenix\u2019s business may be materially and adversely affected.\nPhoenix may not be able to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses, and the anticipated benefits of the recently acquired businesses may not be realized.\nPhoenix has completed multiple acquisitions with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits, including, among other things, complementing Phoenix\u2019s current product offerings and allowing Phoenix to expand and diversify its product offerings by leveraging its existing core competencies. Achieving those anticipated benefits is subject to several uncertainties, including whether Phoenix can integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could also take longer than Phoenix anticipates and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect the achievement of anticipated benefits.\nRisks Related to our Businesses Generally and our Common Stock\nOur ability to engage in some business transactions may be limited by the terms of our debt.\nOur financing documents contain affirmative and negative financial covenants restricting ALJ, Faneuil, Carpets, and Phoenix. Specifically, our loan facilities covenants restrict ALJ, Faneuil, Carpets, and Phoenix from:\n\u2022\nincurring additional debt;\n\u2022\nmaking certain capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nallowing liens to exist;\n\u2022\nentering transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nguaranteeing the debt of other entities, including joint ventures;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating, or otherwise combining with another company; or\n\u2022\ntransferring or selling our assets.\nOur ability to borrow under our loan arrangements depends on our compliance with certain covenants and borrowing base requirements. The ability to meet these covenants and requirements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we or they may not meet these obligations. The failure to comply with these covenants and requirements could result in an event of default under our loan arrangements that, if not cured or waived, could terminate such party\u2019s ability to borrow further, permit acceleration of the relevant debt (and other indebtedness based on cross-default provisions) and permit foreclosure on any collateral granted as security under the loan arrangements, which includes substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, any default under our loan facilities could also result in a material adverse effect on us that may result in our lenders seeking to recover from us or against our assets. There can also be no assurance that the lenders will grant waivers on covenant violations if they occur. Any such event of default would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness depends on factors that are beyond our control.\nWe currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness, some of which require us to make a lump-sum or \u201cballoon\u201d payment at maturity. Our indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage. We expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from our operations and potentially from debt or equity offerings. However, if we do not have sufficient funds to repay the debt at maturity of these loans, we will need to refinance this debt. If the credit environment is constrained at the time the balloon payment is due or our indebtedness otherwise matures, we may not be able to refinance our existing indebtedness on acceptable terms and may be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options. These options include agreeing to otherwise unfavorable financing terms, selling assets on disadvantageous terms or defaulting on the loan and permitting the lender to foreclose. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations, our ability to execute our business plan and effectively compete in the marketplace may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business that could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and settlements or judgments, require significant amounts of management attention and result in the diversion of significant operational resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe, our officers, and our subsidiaries, are currently involved in, and from time to time may become involved in, legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, time-consuming and distracting to our management team, and the expenses of conducting litigation are not inconsequential. Such distraction and expense may adversely affect the execution of our business plan and our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. Further, if we do not prevail in litigation in which we may be involved, our results could be adversely affected, in some cases, materially. For additional information, see \u201cPart I. Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nChanges in interest rates may increase our interest expense.\nAs of September 30, 2019, $90.9 million of our current borrowings under the Cerberus Term Loan, Cerberus/PNC Revolver, and potential future borrowings are, and may continue to be, at variable rates of interest, tied to LIBOR or the Prime Rate of interest, thus exposing us to interest rate risk. Such rates tend to fluctuate based on general economic conditions, general interest rates, Federal Reserve rates and the supply of and demand for credit in the relevant interbanking market. In recent years, the Fed has incrementally changed the target range for the federal funds rate. Changes in the interest rate generally, and particularly when coupled with any significant variable rate indebtedness, could materially adversely impact our interest expense. If interest rates changed in the future by 100 basis points, based on our current borrowings as of September 30, 2019, our interest expense would increase or decrease by $0.9 million per year.\nFurther, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021 (\u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021 and, based on the foregoing, it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. Although it is not possible to predict the effect the FCA Announcement, any discontinuation, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR, we do not expect the effect to have a material impact on our interest expense.\nWe may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.\nAs of September 30, 2019, each of our subsidiaries had a significant backlog. Our backlog is typically subject to large variations from quarter to quarter and comparisons of backlog from period to period are not necessarily indicative of future revenue. The contracts comprising our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period or at all, and the actual revenue from such contracts may differ from our backlog estimates. The timing of receipt of revenue, if any, for projects included in backlog could change because many factors affect the scheduling of projects. In certain instances, customers may have the right to cancel, reduce or defer amounts that we have in our backlog, which could negatively affect our future revenue. The failure to realize all amounts in our backlog could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins. As a result, our subsidiaries\u2019 backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of our future revenue or earnings.\nAccount data breaches involving stored data, or the misuse of such data could adversely affect our reputation, performance, and financial condition.\nWe and each of our subsidiaries provide services that involve the storage of non-public information. Cyber-attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information are constantly evolving, and high-profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized releases of sensitive information have occurred recently at several major U.S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods. Any breach of the systems on which sensitive data and account information are stored or archived and any misuse by our employees, by employees of data archiving services or by other unauthorized users of such data could lead to damage to our reputation, claims against us and other potential increases in costs. If we are unsuccessful in defending any lawsuit involving such data security breaches or misuse, we may be forced to pay damages, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. Also, damage to our reputation stemming from such breaches could adversely affect our prospects. As the regulatory environment relating to companies\u2019 obligations to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions.\nSome of our officers may have outside business interests, which could impair our ability to implement our business strategies and lead to potential conflicts of interest.\nSome of our officers, in the course of their other business activities, may become aware of investments, business or other information which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to other entities to which they owe a fiduciary duty. They may also in the future become affiliated with entities that are engaged in business or other activities similar to those we intend to conduct. As a result, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity particular opportunities or information should be presented. If, as a result of such conflict, we are deprived of investments, business or information, the execution of our business plan and our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to consummate additional acquisitions and dispositions on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully and achieve anticipated synergies, or the acquisitions and dispositions we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and dispositions. Acquisitions and dispositions could involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u2022\nadverse developments with respect to our results of operations as a result of an acquisition which may require us to incur charges and/or substantial debt or liabilities;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business and diversion of resources and management attention from existing businesses and strategic matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulty with assimilation and integration of operations, technologies, products, personnel or financial or other systems;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses, including compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees and/or workforce integration and restructuring;\n\u2022\ndisruption of relationships with current and new personnel, customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nintegration challenges related to implementing or improving internal controls, procedures and/or policies at a business that prior to the acquisition lacked the same level of controls, procedures and/or policies;\n\u2022\nassumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nregulatory challenges or resulting delays; and\n\u2022\npotential disputes (including with respect to indemnification claims) with the buyers of disposed businesses or with the sellers of acquired businesses, technologies, services or products.\nWe may not be able to consummate acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to consummate acquisitions will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable terms for purchase and our access to financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. In addition, we could experience financial or other setbacks if we are unable to realize, or are delayed in realizing, the anticipated benefits resulting from an acquisition, if we incur greater than expected costs in achieving the anticipated benefits or if any business that we acquire or invest in encounters problems or liabilities which we were not aware of or were more extensive than believed.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nOur ability to utilize net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and built-in losses under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code.\nSection 382 of the Code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its NOLs and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company.\nIf we undergo an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock, including purchases or sales of stock between 5% stockholders, our ability to use our NOLs and to recognize certain built-in losses would be subject to the limitations of Section 382. Depending on the resulting limitation, a significant portion of our NOLs could expire before we would be able to use them. At the end of our last fiscal year, September 30, 2019, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $138.1 million that start expiring in 2022. Approximately $115.3 million of the carryforward expires in 2022. Our inability to utilize our NOLs would have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe do not believe we have experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by Section 382 in the last three years. However, whether a change in ownership occurs in the future is largely outside of our control, and there can be no assurance that such a change will not occur.\nIn August 2018, our shareholders approved the amendment of certain provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, updating certain restrictions on transfers of our stock that may result in an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 in order to preserve stockholder value and the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with NOLs and built-in losses under Section 382.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the final version of the Tax Reform Law. The Tax Reform Law significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with many of its provisions effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a permanent reduction of the corporate income tax rate, a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, a limitation of the deduction for net operating loss carryforwards, an indefinite net operating loss carryforward and the elimination of the two-year net operating loss carryback, temporary, immediate expensing for certain new investments and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Reform Law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of this reform on our stockholders is uncertain. Stockholders should consult with their tax advisors regarding the effect of the Tax Reform Law and other potential changes to the U.S. Federal tax laws on them.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers and directors and their affiliated entities together beneficially owned approximately 49.3% of our outstanding common stock at November 30, 2019. Jess Ravich, our current Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 39.2% of our common stock as of November 30, 2019. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together or in a block, could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting companies.\u201d\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\n(a)\nthe last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more;\n(b)\nthe last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement;\n(c)\nthe date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, during the previous 3-year period, issued; or\n(d)\nthe date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer.\nAs an emerging growth company, we are subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.\nAs an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, which allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe are also a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d and have either: (i) a public float of less than $250 million or (ii) annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and (A) no public float or (B) a public float of less than $700 million. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers, including with respect to disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. Until such time as we cease to be a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d such reduced disclosure in our SEC filings may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour quarterly operating results or the operating results of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the economy, the financial markets or our industry;\n\u2022\nrelatively low trading volumes;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of significant acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of various risks described in these Risk Factors.\nAlso, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.\nYour share ownership may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock in the future.\nYour share ownership may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock or securities convertible into common or preferred stock in the future. As of September 30, 2019, a total of 1,654,000 shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding options issued by us at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.39, and 1,296,991 shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding warrants at a weighted-average exercise price of $1.80. It is probable that options or warrants to purchase our common stock will be exercised during their respective terms if the fair market value of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the particular option or warrant. If the stock options or warrants are exercised, your share ownership will be diluted. Additionally, options to purchase up to 1,280,000 shares of ALJ common stock are available for grant under our existing equity compensation plans as of September 30, 2019.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors may determine from time to time that we need to raise additional capital by issuing additional shares of our common stock or other securities. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common or preferred stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common or preferred stock, or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our common stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, our then current shareholders. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock made after this offering or the perception that such sales could occur. We cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our shareholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings.\nWe do not currently plan to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends to the holders of our common stock. Accordingly, holders of our common stock must rely on price appreciation as the sole method to realize a gain on their investment. There can be no assurances that the price of our common stock will ever appreciate in value.\nCertain provisions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation contain transfer restrictions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing beneficial takeover bids by third parties.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation imposes certain restrictions on transfer of stock designed to preserve the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with our NOLs and built-in losses under Section 382. These restrictions prohibit certain transfers that would result in a person or a group of persons acquiring 5% of more of ALJ\u2019s outstanding stock, unless otherwise approved by our Board of Directors or a committee thereof. As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately $138.1\nmillion of NOLs. The use of such losses to offset federal income tax would be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382. This would occur if stockholders owning (or deemed under Section 382 to own) 5% or more of our stock by value increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over a defined period. The transfer restrictions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation were adopted to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d occurring as defined by Section 382. While such transfer restrictions are intended to protect our NOLs and built-in losses under Section 382, they may also have the effect of delaying or preventing beneficial takeover bids by third parties.\nClimate change related events may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our businesses. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is a priority. Any of our locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate related events have the potential to disrupt our business, including the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to resume operations.", "PERMNO": 83398, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "ALJJ"}
