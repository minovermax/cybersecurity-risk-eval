{"cik": "1371446", "company": "FBR & Co.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. If any of the risks, uncertainties, events or developments described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operation could be negatively impacted. In connection with the forward-looking statements that appear in this Form 10-K, you should also carefully review the cautionary statements included under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be materially and adversely affected by financial market conditions and economic conditions generally.\nAs an investment bank, risk is an inherent part of our business. Our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets, particularly the equity capital markets, and economic conditions generally. Conditions in the financial markets in 2015 were marked by declines in energy prices, persistent market volatility and a challenging environment for small-cap equity capital raising. Lower levels of liquidity continue to have a negative effect on trading volumes, particularly in the equity market, which has a direct negative impact on our cash equities trading business.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, stable geopolitical conditions, transparent and efficient capital markets, liquid markets with active investors, low inflation, high business and consumer confidence and strong business earnings. Slowing growth, contraction of credit, increasing energy prices, declines in business or investor confidence or risk tolerance, increases in inflation, higher unemployment, outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability, corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets and natural disasters, among other things, can affect the global financial markets. In addition, economic or political pressures in a country or region may cause local market disruptions and currency devaluations, which may also affect markets generally. In the event of changes in market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, equity, fixed income, commodity or real estate valuations, liquidity, availability of credit or volatility, our businesses could be adversely affected in many ways.\nOur investment banking revenues are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate. Any future market downturns that affect the size and number of capital raising transactions will likely have a negative impact on our investment banking business. Sustained market downturns and credit market dislocations and liquidity issues in the future would also likely lead to a further decline in the volume of secondary market trading that we execute for our institutional brokerage clients and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads earned from the trades we execute for our clients. Heightened risk aversion among investors may cause them to shift their trading activity to higher quality and more liquid products, which are generally less profitable for us.\nWe incurred a loss in 2015 and we have incurred losses in certain prior periods; we may incur losses in the future.\nWe incurred a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $7.5 million and we have incurred losses in certain prior periods. We may incur losses in future periods. If we are unable to fund future losses, those losses may have a significant effect on our liquidity as well as our ability to operate.\nIn addition, we may incur significant expenses in connection with any expansion of our capital markets businesses or in connection with strategic acquisitions and investments. Specifically, we have invested, and will continue to invest, in our capital markets businesses, including hiring a number of senior professionals to expand our product offerings. Accordingly, we would need to increase our revenues at a rate greater than our expenses to achieve and maintain profitability. If our revenues do not increase sufficiently, or if our revenues increase but we are unable to manage our expenses, we may incur losses in future periods.\nOur financial results may fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nWe have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, significant quarterly variations in our revenues and results of operations. These variations may be attributed in part to the fact that our investment banking revenues are typically earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, the timing of which is uncertain and beyond our control. In most cases, we receive little or no payment for investment banking engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction. As a result, our business is highly dependent on market conditions as well as the decisions and actions of our clients and interested third parties. For example, a client\u2019s securities offering may be delayed or terminated because of adverse market conditions, failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or unexpected financial or other problems in the client\u2019s business. If the parties fail to complete an offering in which we are participating as an underwriter or placement agent, we will earn little or no revenue from the transaction. This risk may be intensified by our focus on early-stage companies in certain sectors, as the market for securities of these companies may experience significant variations in the number and size of equity offerings as well as the after-market trading volume and prices of newly issued securities, and the fact most of our investment banking revenue is generated from a relatively small number of significant transactions. Many companies initiating the process of an initial public offering or private institutional equity raise are simultaneously exploring M&A exit opportunities. Our investment banking revenues would be adversely affected in the event that an equity offering for which we are acting as an underwriter is preempted by the company\u2019s sale. As a result of the foregoing, we are unlikely to achieve steady and predictable earnings on a quarterly basis.\nWe are dependent on our executive management team, and we may not be able to execute our business plan in the event that members of our executive management team are no longer available to us and we are unable to find suitable replacements for them or the members of our executive management team do not dedicate a sufficient amount of their professional time to our endeavors.\nWe depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts of our executive management team, and we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the experience of these individuals, whose continued service is not guaranteed. We have no assurance that the services of our executive management team will continue to be available to the full extent of our needs. If certain members of our executive management team leave our company or are otherwise no longer available to us or are not available to the full extent of our needs, we may not be able to replace them with suitable management and may be unable to execute our business plan.\nWe encounter intense competition for qualified professionals from other investment banking firms and from businesses outside the investment banking industry, such as hedge, private equity and venture capital funds, and our failure to hire qualified professionals and retain our existing professionals may materially impede the success and growth of our business.\nOur people are our most valuable resource. Our ability to secure and maintain investment banking engagements and brokerage business depends upon the reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and project execution skills of our professionals. Our professionals\u2019 reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagements. Generally, we do not have employment or non-competition agreements with our professionals. We encounter intense competition for qualified professionals from other companies in the investment banking industry and from businesses outside the investment banking industry, such as hedge, private equity and venture capital funds. We may experience losses of investment banking, brokerage, research and other professionals and our failure to hire qualified professionals and retain our existing professionals may materially impede our success and growth. While we believe that we will continue to be able to retain and recruit qualified professionals, the departure or other loss of our key professionals who manage substantial client relationships or who possess substantial experience and expertise could impair our ability to secure or successfully complete engagements, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any negative financial performance that results in lower compensation levels may exacerbate this risk. In challenging market conditions, as have occurred in recent years, it may be difficult to pay competitive compensation without our ratio of compensation expense to revenues becoming higher. In addition, if any of our investment bankers or members of our executive management team were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services. We may not be able to prevent our key professionals or the members of our executive management team from resigning to join our competitors or from forming a competing company.\nOur capital markets and strategic advisory engagements are singular in nature and our failure to obtain new engagements may harm our operating results.\nOur investment banking clients generally retain us on a short-term, engagement-by-engagement basis in connection with specific capital markets or M&A transactions, rather than on a recurring basis under long-term contracts. As these transactions are typically singular in nature and our engagements with these clients may not recur, we must continuously seek out new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or are terminated. As a result, high activity levels in any period are not necessarily indicative of continued high levels of activity in any subsequent period. If we are unable to generate a substantial number of new engagements that generate fees from the successful completion of transactions, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on relatively few industries to generate a significant percentage of our revenue, which may limit our revenues and net income and may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are dependent on revenues related to securities issued by companies in specific industry sectors. The real estate, energy and natural resources, industrials, insurance, and financial institutions sectors account for the majority of our investment banking, institutional trading and research activities. Therefore, any downturn in the market for the securities of companies in these industry sectors, or factors affecting such companies, could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the frequency and size of securities offerings can vary significantly from industry to industry due to economic, legislative, regulatory and political factors.\nUnderwriting and other capital raising transactions, strategic advisory engagements and related trading activities in the industries on which we focus represent a significant portion of our businesses. This concentration of activity exposes us to the risk of substantial declines in revenues in the event of downturns in these industries. Future downturns in the industries on which we focus could result in a decrease in the size or number of transactions we complete, which would reduce our investment banking revenues.\nWe also derive a significant portion of our revenues from institutional sales and trading transactions related to the securities of companies in these sectors. Our revenues from such institutional sales and trading transactions may decline when underwriting activities in these industry sectors decline, the volume of trading on the NASDAQ, the NYSE or any other securities market or exchange declines, or when industry sectors or individual companies report results below investors\u2019 expectations.\nPricing and other competitive pressures may impair the revenues and profitability of our institutional brokerage business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our institutional brokerage business. Along with other firms, we have experienced intense price competition in this business in recent years. In particular, the ability to execute trades electronically and through alternative trading systems has increased the pressure on trading commissions and spreads. We expect pricing pressures in the business to continue. We believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price or use their own capital to facilitate client trading activities. In addition, we face pressure from our larger competitors, which may be better able to offer a broader range of complementary products and services to clients in order to win their trading business. If we are unable to compete effectively in these areas, the revenues from our sales and trading business may decline, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our research and institutional brokerage business also may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations and industry practices.\nOur institutional brokerage revenues may decline due to competition from alternative trading systems and lower overall volume.\nSecurities and futures transactions are now being conducted electronically and via other alternative, non-traditional trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue and probably accelerate. In addition, industry-wide trading volumes of equity securities have declined in recent years. Any dramatic increase in computer-based or other electronic trading or further declines in trading volumes may\nadversely affect our institutional brokerage revenues. The NYSE\u2019s adoption of its hybrid market for trading securities may increase pressure on our institutional brokerage business as customers execute more of their NYSE-related trades electronically. Even if we were to develop our own electronic trading systems, we cannot assure you that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return on our investment, particularly given the relatively lower commissions arising from electronic trades. As a result, our institutional brokerage revenues could decline in the future, which would negatively impact our cash flows and the value of our common stock.\nWe face strong competition from larger firms, some of which have greater resources and name recognition, which may impede our ability to grow our business.\nThe brokerage and investment banking industries are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including client relationships, reputation, the abilities of our professionals, market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products. We have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses; in particular, discounts in large block trades and trading commissions and spreads. In addition, pricing and other competitive pressures in investment banking, including multiple book runners, co-managers and multiple financial advisors handling transactions, have continued and could adversely affect our revenues. We believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price.\nMany of our competitors in the brokerage and investment banking industries have a broader range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, more senior professionals to serve their clients\u2019 needs, greater global reach and more established relationships with clients than we have. These larger and better capitalized competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the brokerage and investment banking industries, to compete for skilled professionals, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally.\nThe scale of our competitors has increased in recent years as a result of substantial consolidation among companies in the brokerage and investment banking industries. In addition, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial services firms have established or acquired underwriting or financial advisory practices and broker-dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. These firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have the ability to support investment banking with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services in an effort to gain market share, which has resulted, and could further result, in competitive and pricing pressure in our businesses. In particular, the ability to provide financing has become an important advantage for some of our larger competitors and, because we do not provide such financing, we may be unable to compete as effectively for clients in a significant part of the brokerage and investment banking market. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nLarger and more frequent capital commitments in our trading and underwriting business increase the potential for us to incur significant losses.\nWe commit our capital to maintain trading positions in the equity, convertible securities and debt markets. We may enter into large transactions in which we commit our own capital as part of our client trading activities. The number and size of these large transactions may adversely affect our results of operations in a given period. Although, as discussed below, we take measures to manage market risk, we may also incur significant losses from our trading activities due to market fluctuations and volatility in our results of operations. To the extent that we own assets, i.e., have long positions, in any of those markets, a downturn in the value of those assets or in those markets could result in losses. Conversely, to the extent we have sold assets we do not own, i.e., have short positions, in any of those markets, an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially large losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market. Additionally, to the extent that we purchase \u201cwhen issued\u201d securities (i.e., securities that are trading but have not been issued by the issuer) from our trading clients between the pricing date and closing date of an issuer\u2019s securities offering, we may be unable to sell those securities if an adverse event occurs between the pricing and closing date that changes the terms of such offering or securities.\nWe use a number of quantitative measures to manage our exposure to market risk, including inventory position limits, scenario analysis, and value at risk, or VaR. VaR is a model that quantifies potential losses using\nhistorical data. Because the historical market prices used in our VaR analysis may not be an accurate measure of future market events and conditions, especially in highly stressful market environments, and because our VaR model measures the risk of a current net trading position and does not take into account future position changes arising from transaction and/or hedging activity, we could incur losses that are materially greater than our reported VaR, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMany financial services firms commit their own capital as part of their business activities. For example, in order to win business, investment banks may commit to purchase large blocks of stock from publicly traded issuers or significant shareholders, instead of the more traditional marketed underwriting process, in which marketing is typically completed before an investment bank commits to purchase securities for resale. Additionally, standard securities underwritings require investment banks to commit large amounts of capital prior to the closing of such offerings. We have committed capital in these ways, and expect in the future that we will continue to do so from time to time. As a result, we will be subject to risk as we commit capital to facilitate primarily client-driven business and, therefore, may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry.\nLimitations on our access to capital could impair our liquidity and our ability to conduct our businesses.\nLiquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to financial services firms. Failures of financial institutions have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity. Liquidity is of particular importance to our trading business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our clients\u2019 and counterparties\u2019 willingness to engage in brokerage transactions with us. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading clients, third parties or us. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time. Finally, additional repurchases by us of our shares of common stock will further reduce cash available for operations and future growth.\nFBRCM and MLV, both of which are U.S. registered broker-dealers, are subject to the net capital requirements of the SEC and various self-regulatory organizations of which they are members. These requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also mandate that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Prior to our acquisition of MLV, MLV self-reported to FINRA that its regulatory net capital levels had temporarily fallen below minimum required levels. FINRA is currently engaged in an inquiry regarding the circumstances of that event. An adverse finding by FINRA may result in censure, fines, and/or other penalties. Any other failure by either FBRCM or MLV to comply with its net capital requirements could also impair our ability to conduct our core business as a brokerage firm.\nFurthermore, both FBRCM and MLV are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from it to FBR & Co. As a holding company, we are dependent on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, including any debt obligations we may incur. As a result, regulatory actions could impede access to funds that we need to make payments on our obligations, including any debt obligations we may incur.\nWe are highly dependent on communications, information and other systems and third parties, and any systems failures, malicious attack or unauthorized access could significantly disrupt our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on communications, information and other systems, including systems provided by our clearing brokers, and by and for other third parties. Any failure or interruption of our systems, the systems of our clearing brokers or third-party trading or information systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock. In 2015, we switched our principal clearing brokerage firm from J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp., to Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated. In the event that our principal clearing broker was to exit the business, we would be required to enter into alternative clearing arrangements. There can be no assurance that such arrangements will be available on terms that are not materially less favorable to us, or at all. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions, service our clients and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, our clearing brokers provide elements of our principal disaster recovery system. We cannot assure you that we or our clearing brokers will not suffer any systems failure or interruption, including one caused by a hurricane, earthquake, fire, other natural disaster, power or telecommunications failure, act of God, act of war, terrorist attack, pandemic or other emergency situation, or that our or our clearing brokers\u2019 back-up procedures and capabilities in the event of any such failure or interruption will be adequate. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions could significantly harm our business.\nSecure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our internal and third-party computer systems and networks also is critically important to our business. We take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant. However, despite our security measures, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, attack by hackers, computer viruses or other malicious code, inadvertent, erroneous or intercepted transmission of information (including by e-mail), and other events that could have an information security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could harm our business.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management strategies and techniques and expect to continue to do so in the future. However, our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure, breach of contract or other reasons. We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us. If any of the variety of instruments, processes and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses.\nExternal group hires, strategic investments or acquisitions and joint ventures may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business.\nWe have grown and may continue to grow our core businesses through both internal expansion and through external group hiring, strategic investments, acquisitions or joint ventures. To the extent we make external group hires, strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, we face numerous risks and uncertainties, including those that may relate to financial commitments undertaken in connection with any such activity, as well as those that relate to combining or integrating the relevant people, businesses and systems, including the need to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers and business partners. In the case of joint ventures, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. In addition, conflicts or disagreements between us and our joint venture partners may negatively impact our businesses.\nIn September 2015, we acquired MLV. MLV has been named in two putative class action lawsuits involving underwritten securities offerings in 2013 and 2014. An adverse resolution of any of these matters against us could materially affect our financial condition, operating results and liquidity. See Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning litigation.\nOur principal investments expose us to a significant risk of capital loss.\nWe use a portion of our own capital in a variety of principal investment activities, each of which involves risks of illiquidity, loss of principal and revaluation of assets. The companies and investment funds in which we invest may concentrate on markets which are or may be disproportionately impacted by pressures in the sectors on which they focus, and their existing business operations or investment strategy may not perform as projected. As a result, we have suffered losses in the past and we may suffer losses from our principal investment activities in the future.\nOur merchant banking investments are concentrated in relatively few companies and industries and a consequence of this investment strategy is that our investment returns will be materially and adversely affected if the companies or the industries we target perform poorly. As a result, if a significant investment fails to perform as we anticipated our business, financial condition and results of operations could be more negatively affected and the magnitude of the loss could be more significant than if we had made smaller investments in more companies and industries.\nEven if we make an appropriate investment decision based on the intrinsic value of an enterprise or investment fund, we cannot assure you that the market value of the investment will not decline, perhaps materially, as a result of general market conditions or changes in law. For example, an increase in interest rates, a general decline in the stock markets, or other market conditions adverse to companies or investment funds of the type in which we invest could result in a decline in the value of our investments. Additionally, the companies or investment funds in which we invest may be subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and foreign federal, state and/or local agencies. Changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, or new laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on the business and industries of our investment.\nOur due diligence may not reveal all of a portfolio company\u2019s or investment fund\u2019s liabilities and may not reveal other weaknesses in a portfolio company\u2019s or investment fund\u2019s business.\nBefore we make principal investments, whether investments in non-registered investment funds that are managed by third parties, merchant banking and other equity investments, or corporate debt investments, we assess the strength and skills the managers of the enterprise and other factors that we believe will determine the success of the investment. In making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence, we rely on the resources available to us and, in some cases, an investigation by third parties. This process is particularly important and subjective with respect to newly-organized entities because there may be little or no information publicly available about the company or investment fund. We cannot assure you that our due diligence processes will uncover all relevant facts or risks about a company or investment fund in which we make a principal investment, or that any such investment will be successful. Any unsuccessful principal investments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nIn any potential principal investment, we depend on management and have limited ability to influence management of companies and/or investment funds in which we have invested.\nWe generally do not control the management, investment decisions or operations of the enterprises in which we make principal investments. Management of those enterprises may decide to change the nature of their assets or business plan, or management may otherwise change in a manner that is not satisfactory to us. We typically have no ability to affect these management decisions, and as noted below, may have only limited ability to dispose of these investments.\nWe may make principal investments that have limited liquidity, which may reduce the return on those investments to our stockholders.\nThe investments we make in alternative asset classes such as hedge funds are typically subject to restrictions that limit the amount and timing of redemptions. Such restrictions impair the liquidity of such investments, and these restrictions are likely to increase in periods of market volatility. For these and other reasons, we may be unable to liquidate assets at times and in amounts of our choosing, which could result in harm to our investment performance and loss of invested capital.\nThe securities of any new publicly-held or privately-held entity in which we make a merchant banking or other principal investment are likely to be restricted as to resale and may otherwise be highly illiquid. We also expect that there will be restrictions on our ability to resell the securities of any private or newly-public company that we acquire for a period of at least one year after we acquire those securities. Thereafter, a public market sale may be subject to volume limitations or dependent upon securing a registration statement for a secondary offering of the securities.\nThe securities of newly-public entities may trade less frequently and in smaller volume than securities of companies that are more widely held and have more established trading patterns. Sales of these securities may cause their values to fluctuate more sharply. Because we have made and expect to make our principal investments through an affiliate of FBRCM and MLV, registered broker-dealers in the U.S., our ability to invest in companies may be constrained by applicable securities laws and regulations and the rules of FINRA and similar self-regulatory organizations. Our investment and trading activities are regulated by the SEC, FINRA and other governmental authorities. As a result, the rules of the SEC, FINRA, and other governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations may limit our ability to invest in initial public offerings as well as other offerings of companies whose securities are underwritten or privately placed by FBRCM and MLV.\nPrices of the equity securities of new entities in which we make principal investments may be volatile. We may make principal investments that are significant relative to the subject company\u2019s overall capitalization, and resales of significant amounts of these securities might adversely affect the market and the sales price for the securities.\nThe disposition value of our principal investments is dependent upon general and specific market conditions which could result in a decline of the value of these investments. Additionally, due to FINRA rules regarding underwriting compensation, securities we purchase in our private placements may be subject to a 180-day lockup period or longer beginning on the effective date of the issuer\u2019s IPO or resale registration statement. Such lockup periods could affect our ability to dispose of our principal investments at opportune prices.\nOur capital markets business is dependent on cash inflows to the mutual fund industry and other pooled investment vehicles, which could result in our experiencing operating losses if cash flows slow.\nA slowdown or reversal of cash inflows to the mutual fund industry and other pooled investment vehicles could lead to lower capital markets revenues for us since mutual funds and other pooled investment vehicles purchase a significant portion of the securities offered in public and private offerings underwritten by FBRCM and MLV and subsequently traded in the secondary markets. Demand for new equity offerings has been driven in part by institutional investors, particularly large mutual funds and hedge funds, seeking to invest on behalf of their investors. The public may redeem mutual funds as a result of a decline in the market generally or as a result of a decline in mutual fund net asset values. To the extent that a decline in cash inflows into mutual funds reduces demand by fund managers for public or private offerings, our capital markets business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, a slowdown in investment activity by mutual funds may have an adverse effect on the securities markets generally. In addition, the increased prevalence of lower cost passively-managed funds that are linked to securities indices may lead to lower capital markets revenues for us since many of the securities offerings underwritten by FBRCM and MLV involve securities that are not included in any index.\nDeclines in the market values of our investments may adversely affect periodic reported results and credit availability, which may reduce earnings.\nWe make principal and merchant banking investments that are classified for accounting purposes as \u201cavailable-for-sale.\u201d Changes in the market values of those assets will be directly charged or credited to stockholders\u2019 equity. As a result, a further decline in market value of our investment securities may further reduce our book value. Moreover, if the decline in value of an available-for-sale security is other-than-temporary, such decline will reduce earnings, as will a decline in the value of securities classified as trading for accounting purposes.\nA decline in the market value of our assets may adversely affect us particularly in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets. If the market value of those assets declines, the lender may require us to post additional collateral to support the loan. If we were unable to post the additional collateral, we would have to sell the assets at a time when we might not otherwise choose to do so. A reduction in credit available may reduce our earnings.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively affect the value of investments we make with our capital, which could result in reduced earnings or losses.\nWe invest our capital from time to time in interest rate sensitive securities. \u201cLong\u201d investments that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations will decline in value if long-term interest rates increase, and \u201cshort\u201d investments that are sensitive to interest rate risk will decline in value if long-term interest rates decrease. Declines in market value may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to us. In addition, changes in interest rates may impact some of our fund investments and/or merchant banking investments in companies whose business models are sensitive to interest rates.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our securities lending business.\nWe have an active securities borrowed and loaned business in which we borrow securities from one party and lend them to another. As a result, market risk in our securities lending business arises when the market value of securities borrowed declines relative to the cash we post as collateral with the lender; and when the market value of securities we have loaned increases relative to the cash we have received as collateral from the borrower. Market value fluctuations in our securities lending business are measured daily and any exposure versus cash received or posted is settled daily with counterparties. In addition, credit risk from our securities lending operations arises if a lender or borrower defaults on an outstanding securities loan or borrow transaction and the cash or securities we are holding is insufficient to cover the amount they owe us for that receivable. Finally, there is systemic risk associated with the concentration of clearing and related functions in covered clearing agencies involved in securities lending activities such as the Options Clearing Corp. and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. The market and credit risks associated with our securities lending business have the potential of adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating risks associated with our securities lending business may result in counterparty losses, and in certain circumstances, potential financial liabilities for us.\nAs part of our securities lending business, we lend securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of their clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. We must manage this process and are charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. Our failure to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for counterparties in our securities lending business (separate from the risks of collateral investments). Additionally, in certain circumstances, we could potentially be held liable for the failure to manage any such risks.\nIf we become subject to the registration requirements of the 1940 Act as a result of our principal investing activities, our ability to operate our business as contemplated would be impaired and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nThe 1940 Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operations of investment companies. Among other things, the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the issuance of stock options, and impose certain governance requirements. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under 1940 Act. However, if anything were to happen which would cause us to be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act, requirements imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates and ability to compensate key employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and among us and our subsidiaries, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and are dependent on our subsidiaries for funds.\nSince we are a holding company, our cash flow and consequent ability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations under securities we issue are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings as dividends or loans or other payments by those subsidiaries to us. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to various capital adequacy requirements promulgated by regulatory and other authorities. These regulatory rules may restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiaries by dividends, loans or other payments. Additionally, our ability to participate as an equity holder in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation is generally subordinate to the claims of creditors of the subsidiary.\nOur exposure to legal risk is significant, and damages that we may be required to pay and the reputational harm that could result from legal action against us could materially adversely affect our businesses.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses and, in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing. These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions, potential liability for \u201cfairness opinions\u201d and other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions, including liability in connection with conflicts of interest, and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements. We are also subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment, among other things.\nAs a brokerage and investment banking firm, we depend to a large extent on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients. As a result, if our reputation is harmed, it may be more damaging in our business than in other businesses. Moreover, our role as advisor to our clients on important underwriting or M&A transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment, including rendering \u201cfairness opinions\u201d in connection with mergers and other transactions. Therefore, our activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and aggrieved third parties, including stockholders of our clients who could bring securities class actions against us. Our investment banking engagements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services, but these provisions may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. Furthermore, there is no assurance that an investment banking client will be able to satisfy its indemnity or contribution obligations when due. As a result, we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business and prospects. See Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning litigation in which we are involved.\nRisks Related to Use of Estimates and Valuations\nWe make various estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures.\nWe make various estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Broadly, those estimates are used in measuring fair value of certain financial instruments, accounting for identifiable intangible assets, establishing provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation, regulatory proceedings and tax examinations, assessing our ability to realize deferred taxes and valuing equity-based compensation awards. Estimates are based on available information and judgment. Therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates and that difference could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nSee Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning our use of estimates and valuation methodologies.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nSignificantly expanded corporate governance and public disclosure requirements may result in fewer initial public offerings and deter existing public companies from engaging in capital market transactions which may reduce the number of investment banking opportunities available to pursue.\nHighly-publicized financial scandals in recent years have led to investor concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets, and have prompted the United States Congress, the SEC, the NYSE and NASDAQ to significantly expand corporate governance and public disclosure requirements. To the extent that private companies, in order to avoid becoming subject to these new requirements, decide to forgo initial public offerings, our equity underwriting business may be adversely affected. In addition, provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the corporate governance rules imposed by self-regulatory organizations have diverted many companies\u2019 attention away from capital market transactions, including securities offerings and acquisition and disposition transactions. In particular, companies that are or are planning to be public are incurring significant expenses in complying with the SEC and accounting standards relating to internal control over financial reporting, and companies that disclose material weaknesses in such controls under the new standards may have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets. These factors, in addition to adopted or proposed accounting and disclosure changes, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFinancial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years, increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and under the laws of other countries in which we do business. We are also regulated by a number of self-regulatory organizations. The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, including the SEC, NYSE, FINRA, and state attorneys general. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years. This regulatory and enforcement environment has created uncertainty with respect to a number of transactions that had historically been entered into by financial services firms and that were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate. We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. The specific impact of Dodd-Frank on our businesses, our clients and the markets in which we operate will depend on the manner in which the relevant agencies continue to develop and implement the required rules and the reaction of market participants to these regulatory developments over the next several years. We also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other United States or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets, including FINRA. Among other things, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business prospects.\nIn addition, financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts. The SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts and regularly seek to review and update our policies, controls and procedures. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. Our policies and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs, additional operational personnel and increased regulatory risk. Failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation. For example, the research areas of investment banks have been and remain the subject of heightened regulatory scrutiny which has led to increased restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at securities firms.\nThe effort to combat money laundering and terrorist financing is a priority in governmental policy with respect to financial institutions. The obligation of financial institutions, including ourselves, to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls which have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs. Regulators have also stepped up regulation and enforcement to catch and punish bribery or similar corrupt practices by financial institutions. Any failure with respect to our programs in this area could subject us to serious regulatory consequences, including substantial fines, and potentially other liabilities.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us and is difficult to detect and deter.\nOur reputation is critical in maintaining our relationship with clients, investors, regulators and the general public and is a key focus in our risk management efforts. In recent years, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur at our company. For example, misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. Misconduct by employees could include binding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits or present unacceptable risks, or hiding from us unauthorized or unsuccessful activities, which, in either case, may result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. As a result, we could suffer significant reputational harm for any misconduct by our employees. In addition, in certain circumstances our reputation could be damaged by activities of our clients or of hedge funds or other entities in which we invest, over which we have little or no control.\nThe soundness and business continuity of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us.\nWe face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions. As a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives should the need arise. Any failure, termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to exercise transactions, service our clients and manage our exposure to risk.\nOur ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, funding, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative\nexposure due us. Although we have not suffered any material or significant losses as a result of the failure of any financial counterparty, any such losses in the future may materially adversely affect our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 92093, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "FBRC"}
