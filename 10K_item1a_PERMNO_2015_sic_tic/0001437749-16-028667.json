RISK FACTORS\nThe loss or interruption of supply from our key parts suppliers could limit our ability to distribute our products.\nWe purchase certain products from various suppliers, some of which are located outside of the United States. Any loss or interruption of supply from our key parts suppliers may require us to find new suppliers. The number of suppliers for certain electronic components is limited. We could experience delays while we seek new suppliers and could have difficulty finding new suppliers, which would substantially impair our operating results and business.\nThe loss of the Illinois VGT contract with GTech will reduce our revenues and our profitability and the Company will continue to incur losses.\nWe had an exclusive contract to distribute VGT\u2019s in Illinois for GTech. This exclusive contract expired on June 15, 2015. Since the contract was not renewed, we are no longer able to sell Spielo VGT\u2019s in Illinois which will significantly reduce our future revenues and profitability. The Company has incurred losses in 2014 and 2015 and expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company has lost employees and executives.\nOn December 8, 2015, the Company\u2019s prior chief financial officer resigned. The Company has not hired a replacement. Other accounting staff has resigned since that date. During the review of strategic alternatives, in September 2015, the Special Committee of the Board of Directors placed the Chief Executive Officer on paid leave. The lack of management personnel may have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the Company.\nThe gaming business is heavily regulated and we depend on our ability to obtain/maintain regulatory approvals.\nNearly all of the jurisdictions in the United States require licenses, permits, documentation of qualification, including evidence of financial stability, and other forms of approval for distributors of gaming equipment and supplies and for their key personnel. The revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions. In addition, laws and regulations applicable to our business could be changed or repealed. These changes could affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Company is pursuing certain strategic transactions that involve significant risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company expects to continue incurring costs in pursuing, evaluating and negotiating particular strategic transactions, but its efforts might not prove successful. For example, such transactions might not be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. Or, if such a transaction is entered into by the Company, the Company might not ever close such transaction or realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction. For example, some transactions may require shareholder approval or regulatory approvals, which may not be received.\nCertain strategic transactions that the Company is pursuing might dilute the equity interests of our common shareholders.\nCertain strategic transactions that the Company is pursuing might involve, through one or more transactions, the issuance of our capital stock, which will dilute (either economically or in percentage terms, or both) the ownership interests of our existing shareholders.\nIf the Company is unable to enter into one or more other strategic transactions, the Company will have to consider liquidation.\nIf we are unable to enter into a strategic transaction on terms acceptable to the Company and realize certain benefits from such transaction, the Company might be required to dispose of or liquidate its assets at some future date at values less than what we believe their current values to be and at which they are carried on our financial statements.\nThe Company might not meet listing requirements during 2016 and therefore might be subject to delisting.\nIt is a requirement of NYSE MKT that the Company maintain shareholder equity of more than $5 million in order to remain listed. The Company\u2019s equity at year end was $5,358,000. The Company\u2019s equity will likely drop below $5.0 million during the first half of 2016. As a result, the Company could become subject to delisting by the NYSE.\nThe market price for our shares is susceptible to significant changes in market price.\nHistorically, the volume of trading of our shares has been relatively low. As a result, larger than average buy or sell orders on a given day, or news about us or the gaming industry, has had and may in the future have a significant impact on the trading price for our shares.\nIntense competition in our industry could impair our ability to grow and achieve profitability.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. The market for our products and services is intensely competitive and constantly attracts new competitors even as others leave the industry due to low barriers to entry to our business. Some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial, marketing and product development resources. In addition, new competitors may enter our key markets. This may place us at a disadvantage in responding to our competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, technological advances and other initiatives.\nThe current economic conditions might cause sales to decline without warning making it difficult to reduce costs fast enough to maintain profitability.\nOur customers\u2019 business (and their customers\u2019 business) might decline more than we or our customers are forecasting making it difficult for us to reduce our expenses as fast as our sales decline. Although the Company strives to keep our expenses in line with current sales, we could experience periods where the sales decline occurs so rapidly that we are unprofitable for a period of time.", "PERMNO": 63829, "SIC": 5090, "TIC": "AGNUQ"}
