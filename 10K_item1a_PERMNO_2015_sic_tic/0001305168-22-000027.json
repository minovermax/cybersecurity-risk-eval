{"cik": "1305168", "company": "ARC DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d or in other filings with the SEC, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and the trading price of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that are not currently believed by us to be material may also harm our business operations and financial results. Because of the following risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisk Related to the Impact of the Novel Coronavirus (or COVID-19) Pandemic on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures, which have adversely affected work forces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current operations and policies as additional information and public health guidance become available, precautionary measures that have been adopted could negatively affect our customer success efforts or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. Additionally, our customers and potential customers may and have been exposed to similar operational considerations, resulting in significant pressures on their expenditures, and subsequently resulting in a decreased demand for our service offerings.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to disrupt the operations of our customers and partners for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, potentially leading to prolonged and disproportionate impacts to certain industries, which could adversely affect demand for our service offerings and harm our business and results of operations. Further, as companies adapt to the changing economic environment, they may have purchasing behavior which does not match historical trends, negatively impacting our financial results.\nIt is not possible for us to estimate the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations, or financial condition at this time as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA significant portion of our revenue across all of our product and services is generated from customers in the AEC/O industry. Any decline in that industry could adversely affect our future revenue and profitability.\nWe estimate that customers in the AEC/O industry accounted for more than 50% of our net sales in 2021; therefore, our results largely depend on the strength of that industry. Our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and variable nature of the AEC/O industry. We believe that the AEC/O industry generally experiences downturns several months after a downturn in the general economy, and that there may be a similar delay in the recovery of the AEC/O industry following a recovery of the general economy. A downturn in the AEC/O industry would diminish demand for all of our products and services, and would therefore negatively affect our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive a significant percentage of net sales from within the State of California and our business could be disproportionately harmed by an economic downturn or natural disaster affecting California.\nWe derived approximately 33% of our net sales in 2021 from our operations in California. Accordingly, we are sensitive to economic factors affecting business activity in California, including general and local economic conditions, declines in specific industries, macroeconomic trends, political factors affecting commerce and economic development, and natural disasters (including drought, earthquakes and wildfires) the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change. Any adverse developments affecting California could have a disproportionately negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to successfully market and execute several different, but related, service offerings. Failure to do so could impede our future growth and adversely affect our competitive position.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to offer and grow a variety of service offerings that are relatively new to the company. Our efforts will be affected by our ability to acquire new customers for our new service offerings as well as sell the new service offerings to existing customers. If we fail to procure new customers or sell these services to our existing customers, our growth may be adversely affected and we may incur operating losses as a result of a failure to realize revenue from the investments made in new service offerings.\nBecause a significant portion of our overall costs are fixed, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in revenue.\nOur network of service centers, equipment and related support activities involves substantial fixed costs which cannot be adjusted quickly to respond to declines in demand for our services. We estimate that approximately 26% of our overall costs were fixed in 2021. As a consequence, our results of operations are subject to relatively high levels of volatility and our earnings could deteriorate rapidly in the face of declining revenues because our ability to reduce fixed costs in the short-term is limited. If we fail to manage our fixed costs appropriately, or to maintain adequate cash reserves to cover such costs, we may suffer material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon our vendors to continue to supply us with equipment, parts, supplies, and services at comparable terms and price levels as the business grows.\nOur access to equipment, parts, supplies, and services depends upon our relationships with, and our ability to purchase these items on competitive terms from our principal vendors. These vendors are not required to use us to distribute their equipment and are generally free to change the prices and other terms at which they sell to us. In addition, we compete with the selling efforts of some of these vendors. Our reliance on a limited number of principal vendors presents various risks. These include the risk that an interruption in our relationships with our principal vendors for any reason, such as a natural catastrophe, epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or actions taken in regard to increased tariffs on goods produced in certain countries such as China, we may not be able to develop an alternate source without incurring material additional costs and substantial delays. Significant deterioration in relationships with, or in the financial condition of, these significant vendors could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell equipment as well as our ability to provide effective service and technical support to our customers. If one of these vendors terminates or significantly curtails its relationship with us, or if one of these vendors ceases operations, we would be forced to expand our relationships with our other existing vendors or seek out new relationships with previously unused vendors.\nOur failure to adequately protect the proprietary aspects of our technology solutions may cause us to lose market share.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect and preserve the proprietary aspects of our technology products. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, license and subscription agreements, and technical measures to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. These protections, however, may be inadequate. It is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. Furthermore, we may, from time to time, be subject to intellectual property litigation which can be expensive, a burden on management\u2019s time and our Company\u2019s resources, and the outcome of any such litigation may be uncertain.\nCompetition in our industry and innovation by our competitors may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive, with competition primarily at local and regional levels. We compete primarily based on the level and quality of customer service, technological leadership, and price. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to improve our service and product offerings, and develop and integrate new technology solutions. In addition, current and prospective customers may decide to perform certain services themselves instead of outsourcing these services to us. These competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with laws related to privacy and data security could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. In particular, health-related laws and regulations such as HIPAA may also have an impact on our business in light of the HIPAA-compliant scanning and storage capabilities we offer and provide to certain customers. In\naddition, changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in the user data we collect being deemed protected health information under HIPAA. If we are unable to comply with the applicable privacy and security requirements, we could be subject to claims, legal liabilities, penalties, fines, and negative publicity, which could harm our operating results.\nOur information technology and telecommunications systems are susceptible to damage, breach or interruption.\nThe management of our business is aided by the uninterrupted operation of our information technology, including computer hardware and software, and telecommunication systems. These systems are vulnerable to security breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, computer viruses, or other interruptions or damage stemming from power outages, equipment failure or unintended usage by employees. In particular, our employees may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. In addition, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, partners and consultants, including through cloud-based platforms often provided by third parties. The breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches. Security breaches, including cyber-attacks by computer hackers, foreign governments, cyber terrorists, may disable or damage the proper functioning of our systems. It is possible that our security controls, or those of the third parties with whom we partner, over personal and other data may not prevent unauthorized access to, or destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of personally identifiable or other proprietary, confidential, sensitive or valuable information of ours or others; this access could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential Company or client information. Any such disclosure or damage to our systems, or those of third parties with which we partner, could subject us to third party claims and reputational harm. If these events occur, our ability to attract new clients may be impaired or we may be subject to damages and/or regulatory penalties and fines. In addition, system-wide or local failures of these information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDamage or disruption to our facilities, including our technology center, could impair our ability to effectively provide our services and may have a significant effect on our revenues, expenses and financial condition.\nOur IT systems are an important part of our operations. We currently store customer data at servers hosted by Amazon Web Services and at our technology center located in San Ramon, California near known earthquake fault zones. Although we have redundant systems and offsite backup procedures in place, interruption in service, damage to or destruction of our technology center or a disruption of our data storage processes resulting from sustained process abnormalities, human error, acts of terrorism, violence, war or a natural disaster, such as fire, earthquake or flood, could result in delays, in reduced levels of customer service and have a material adverse effect on the markets in which we operate and on our business operations.\nAlthough we currently maintain general property damage insurance, if we incur losses from uninsured events, we could incur significant expenses which would adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAdded risks are associated with our international operations.\nWe have international operations in China, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, and United Arab Emirates. Approximately 11% of our revenues for 2021 were derived from our international operations, with approximately 4% derived from China. Our future revenues, costs of operations and net income could be adversely affected by a number of factors related to our international operations, including changes in economic conditions from country to country (resulting from pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak or otherwise), currency fluctuations, changes in a country\u2019s political condition, trade protection measures, licensing and other legal requirements and local tax issues.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract, retain, and successfully integrate skilled personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to attract, retain, and successfully integrate qualified personnel is critical to our success. As we continue to place more emphasis on document management and storage technology, our need to hire and retain software and other technology-focused personnel has increased, and can be expected to continue to increase. Competition for such personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, is intense. If we lose key personnel and/or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to manage and grow our business will be adversely affected. In addition, the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team would disrupt our business and impede our ability to successfully execute our business strategy.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and periodic litigation that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a number of risks inherent to our status as an employer, including claims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our employees, claims by our employees and former employees of discrimination or harassment; claims relating to\nviolations of wage, hour and other workplace regulations; and claims relating to employee benefits, entitlements to employee benefits, or errors in the calculation or administration of such benefits.\nIf we experience significant incidents in any of the above-described areas, we could face substantial out-of-pocket losses, or fines. In addition, such claims may give rise to litigation, which may be time consuming, distracting and costly, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, and the costs of compliance, could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. Under these laws and regulations, we may be liable for, among other things, the cost of investigating and remediating contamination, regardless of fault or actions on our part. The amount of any such expense or related natural resource damages for which we may be held responsible could be substantial. We cannot predict the potential financial impact on our business if adverse environmental, health, or safety conditions are discovered, or environmental, health, and safety requirements become more stringent. If we are required to incur environmental, health, or safety compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated and accrued by us, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, depending on the magnitude of the cost.\nChanges in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax provisions are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of tax provision is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal, state, and local governments and administrative bodies within the U.S., which represents a majority of our operations, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other regulatory reforms that may impact us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our federal corporate tax rate, our deferred income taxes, the taxation of foreign earnings and the timing of certain research and development deductions. It is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential impact of proposed or future changes, but such changes could have a material impact on our business.\nResults of tax examinations may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe are subject to various tax examinations on an ongoing basis. Adverse results of tax examinations for income, payroll, value added, sales-based and other taxes may require future material tax payments if we are unable to sustain our position with the relevant jurisdiction. Where appropriate, we have made accruals for these matters which are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur debt instruments impose certain restrictions on our ability to operate which in turn could negatively affect our ability to respond to changing business and market conditions and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $78.2 million in outstanding short and long-term borrowings under our credit facilities, and finance leases, excluding trade payables and operating leases. The terms of the agreements under which this indebtedness was incurred may limit or restrict, among other things, our ability to incur certain additional debt, make certain restricted payments, consummate certain asset sales, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.\nWe are also required to maintain a total leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio under our credit agreement with U.S. Bank National Association, dated April 22, 2021, or the 2021 Credit Agreement. Our inability to meet these ratios could result in the acceleration of the repayment of the outstanding obligations under the 2021 Credit Agreement, the termination of the lenders\u2019 commitment to provide our revolving line of credit thereunder, the increase in our effective cost of funds or the cross-default of other credit arrangements. As a result, our ability to operate may be restricted and our ability to respond to business and market conditions may be limited, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market prices of our common stock is volatile, and may be impacted by factors other than our financial performance, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, the closing price of our common stock fluctuated from a low of $1.54 to a high of $3.50 per share.\nIn the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention as well as our other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends in the past. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock are in the best interests of our shareholders and in compliance with applicable laws. Our dividend payments and repurchases of shares of our common stock may change from time to time. Management currently intends to continue quarterly dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, but we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing, sustainability, or any particular amounts of future dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock. A suspension in our dividend payments or repurchases of shares of our common stock could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would have a negative effect on returns on investment to our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 90548, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "ARC"}
