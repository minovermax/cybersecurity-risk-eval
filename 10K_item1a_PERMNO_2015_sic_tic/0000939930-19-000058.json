{"cik": "939930", "company": "PYXUS INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-06-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor calls and webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201ccontinues,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d \u201ctargets\u201d and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in Pyxus International, Inc. securities. In connection with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important risk factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nWe may not continue to have access to the capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing on acceptable terms and conditions.\nWe access the short-term capital markets and, from time to time, the long-term markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of acceptable terms and conditions of, such financing are impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings; (ii) the liquidity and volatility of the overall capital markets; and (iii) the current state of the economy, including the tobacco industry. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nWe may not have access to available capital to finance our local operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe have typically financed our non-U.S. local operations with uncommitted short-term operating credit lines at the local level. These operating lines are typically seasonal in nature, normally extending for a term of 180 to 270 days corresponding to the tobacco crop cycle in that location. These facilities are typically uncommitted in that the lenders have the right to cease making loans or demand payment of outstanding loans at any time. In addition, each of these operating lines must be renewed with each tobacco crop season in that jurisdiction. Although our foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under these lines, many of them are guaranteed by us.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $429.0 million drawn and outstanding on short-term seasonal lines with maximum capacity totaling $795.9 million, subject to limitations under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Facility\"). Additionally against these lines there was $10.7 million available in unused letter of credit capacity with $5.4 million issued but unfunded.\nBecause the lenders under these operating lines typically have the right to cancel the loan at any time and each line must be renewed with each crop season, there can be no assurance that this capital will be available to our subsidiaries. If a number of these lenders cease lending to our subsidiaries or dramatically decrease such lending, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nFailure of foreign banks in which our subsidiaries deposit funds or the failure to transfer funds or honor withdrawals may affect our results of operations.\nFunds held by our foreign subsidiaries are often deposited in their local banks. Banks in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to a higher rate of failure or may not honor withdrawals of deposited funds. In addition, the countries in which these local banks operate may lack sufficient regulatory oversight or suffer from structural weaknesses in the local banking system. Due to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments, these local banks also may be subject to exchange controls and therefore unable to perform transfers of certain currencies. If our ability to gain access to these funds was impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to satisfy the covenants included in our financing arrangements, which could result in the default of our outstanding debt obligations.\nThe agreement governing the ABL Facility includes certain restrictive covenants and a springing covenant requiring that our fixed charge coverage ratio be no less than 1.00 to 1.00 during any period commencing at any time that the excess borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is less than a specified amount and ending on the first date after excess borrowing availability has been equal to or greater than such specified amount for a period of 30 consecutive days. The agreements governing our other indebtedness and the indentures governing our 8.500% senior secured first lien notes due 2021 (the \u201csenior secured first lien notes\u201d) and our 9.875% senior secured second lien notes due 2021 (the \u201csenior secured second lien notes,\" and, together with the senior secured first lien notes, the \"senior notes\") also include restrictive covenants. Prior to the establishment of the ABL Facility, we sought and obtained waivers and amendments under our existing financing arrangements to avoid future non-compliance with financial covenants and cure past defaults under restrictive covenants. We also paid significant fees to obtain these waivers and consents. You should consider this in evaluating our ability to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and the financial costs of our ability to do so. Any future defaults for which we do not obtain waivers or amendments could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our indebtedness, much of which is cross-defaulted to other indebtedness.\nWe have substantial debt which may adversely affect us by limiting future sources of financing, interfering with our ability to pay interest and principal on the senior notes and subjecting us to additional risks.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and debt service obligations. As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $1,327.7 million. If we incur additional indebtedness to our current indebtedness levels, including borrowings under the ABL Facility or other short or long-term credit facilities, the related risks that we now face could increase.\nOur substantial debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the senior notes and our other obligations;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms and to otherwise fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt refinancing, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\na significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to paying interest on and the repayment of the principal of our indebtedness. This reduces the amount of cash we have available for making principal and interest payments under the senior notes and for other purposes and makes us more vulnerable to a decrease in demand for leaf tobacco, increases in our operating costs or general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust to changing market conditions and to compete with other global leaf tobacco merchants may be hampered by the amount of debt we owe;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities.\nIn addition, the agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes each contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with certain covenants within the ABL Facility could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. Also, a substantial portion of our debt, including any borrowings under the ABL Facility, bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher debt service requirements, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our significant leverage.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future under the terms of the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreement governing the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility provides for a revolving credit line of up to $60.0 million subject to a borrowing base of eligible inventory and accounts receivable, and under certain conditions, we may solicit the lenders under the ABL Facility or other prospective lenders to provide additional revolving loan commitments under the ABL Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $15.0 million (less the aggregate principal amount of any additional notes issued under the indenture governing the senior secured first lien notes). As of March 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility and $60.0 million, subject to limitations under the ABL Facility, was available for borrowing under the ABL Facility and an additional $361.6 million was available for borrowing under other short and long-term credit facilities, including $5.3 million with respect to issued but unfunded letters of credit. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks discussed above could intensify.\nOur debt agreements will contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes contain a number of significant covenants. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the ABL Facility requires us to periodically satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio during any period commencing at any time that excess borrowing availability is less than a specified amount and ending on the first date after excess borrowing availability has been equal to or greater than such specified amount for a period of 30 consecutive days. Complying with these covenants and tests may cause us to take actions that we otherwise would not take or not take actions that we otherwise would take. The failure to comply with these covenants and tests would cause a default under the ABL Facility and under the indentures governing the senior notes and would prevent us from taking certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, paying dividends or redeeming the senior secured first lien notes, the senior secured second lien notes or any subordinated debt. A default, if not waived, could result in the debt under the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes becoming immediately due and payable and could result in a default or acceleration of our other indebtedness with cross-default provisions. If this occurs, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the senior notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the ABL Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the senior notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nWe may not be able to refinance or renew our indebtedness, including the senior notes and the ABL Facility, or be able to borrow under the ABL Facility or other future credit facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nLoans under the ABL Facility will mature on January 14, 2021. We may not be able to renew or refinance the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, including the senior secured notes, on substantially similar terms, or at all. We may have to pay additional fees and expenses that we might not have to pay under normal circumstances, and we may have to agree to terms that could increase the cost of our debt structure. If we are unable to renew or refinance the ABL Facility, the senior notes or our other indebtedness on terms which are not materially less favorable than the terms currently available to us or obtain alternative or additional financing arrangements, we may not be able to repay the ABL Facility, the senior notes or certain of our other indebtedness, which may result in a default under other indebtedness.\nWe may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the ABL Facility, the senior secured first lien notes and the senior secured second lien notes, on or before maturity. Additionally, to the extent permitted under the agreement governing the ABL Facility and indentures governing the senior secured first lien notes and the senior secured second lien notes, we may repurchase, repay or tender for our bank debt, senior secured first lien notes and the senior secured second lien notes or other debt, which may place pressure on future cash requirements to the extent that the debt repurchased, repaid or tendered cannot be redrawn.\nRisks Relating to Our Tobacco Operations\nOur reliance on a small number of significant customers may adversely affect our financial statements.\nThe customers of our leaf tobacco business are manufacturers of cigarette and other tobacco products. Several of these customers individually account for a significant portion of our sales in a normal year.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, each of Philip Morris International, Inc., China Tobacco International Inc. and Imperial Brands, PLC, including their respective affiliates, accounted for more than 10% of our revenues from continuing operations. In addition, tobacco product manufacturers have experienced consolidation and further consolidation among our customers could decrease such customers\u2019 demand for our leaf tobacco or processing services. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nContinued vertical integration by our customers could materially adversely affect our financial statements.\nDemand for our leaf tobacco or processing services could be materially reduced if cigarette manufacturers continue to significantly vertically integrate their operations, either through acquisition of our competitors, establishing new operations or contracting directly with suppliers. Japan Tobacco, Inc. has vertically integrated operations in Malawi, Brazil and the United States. In addition, Philip Morris International, Inc. acquired supplier contracts and related assets in Brazil in order to procure leaf directly. In general, our results of operations have been adversely affected by vertical integration initiatives. Although some customers have reversed certain aspects of their previous vertical integration of operations, further vertical integration by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nGlobal shifts in sourcing customer requirements may negatively affect our organizational structure and asset base.\nThe global leaf tobacco industry has experienced shifts in the sourcing of customer requirements for tobacco. For example, significant tobacco production volume decreases have occurred in the United States and Europe from historical levels. At the same time, production volumes in other sourcing origins have stabilized. Additional shifts in sourcing may occur as a result of currency fluctuations, including changes in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, the imposition of tariffs and other changes in international trade policies. A shift in sourcing origins in Europe has been influenced by modifications to the tobacco price support system in the European Union (EU). Customer requirements have changed due to these variations in production, which could influence our ability to plan effectively for the longer term in the United States and Europe.\nWe may not be able to timely or efficiently adjust to shifts in sourcing origins, and adjusting to shifts may require changes in our production facilities in certain origins and changes in our fixed asset base. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, restructuring charges as we continue to adjust to shifts in sourcing. Adjusting our capacity and adjusting to shifts in sourcing may have an adverse impact on our ability to manage our costs, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur financial results will vary according to growing conditions, customer indications and other factors, which reduces your ability to gauge our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nOur financial results, particularly the quarterly financial results, may be significantly affected by fluctuations in tobacco growing seasons and crop sizes which affect the supply of tobacco. Crop sizes may be affected by, among other things, crop infestation and disease, the volume of annual tobacco plantings and yields realized by supplier and suppliers' elections to grow crops other than tobacco. The cultivation period for tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors, including the weather and other natural events, such as hurricanes or tropical storms, and our processing schedule and results of operations for any quarterly period can be significantly altered by these factors.\nThe cost of acquiring tobacco can fluctuate greatly due to crop sizes and increased competition in certain markets in which we purchase tobacco. For example, short crops in periods of high demand translate into higher average green prices, higher throughput costs and less volume to sell. Furthermore, large crops translate into lower average green prices, lower throughput costs and excess volume to sell.\nThe timing and unpredictability of customer indications, orders and shipments cause us to keep tobacco in inventory, increase our risk and result in variations in quarterly and annual financial results. The timing of shipments can be materially impacted by shortages of containers and vessels for shipping as well as infrastructure and accessibility issues in ports we use for shipment. We may, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, keep a significant amount of processed tobacco in inventory for our customers to accommodate their inventory management and other needs. Sales recognition by us and our subsidiaries is based on the passage of ownership, usually with shipment of product. Because individual shipments may represent significant amounts of revenue, our quarterly and annual financial results may vary significantly depending on our customers\u2019 needs and shipping instructions. These fluctuations result in varying volumes and sales in given periods, which also reduces your ability to compare our financial results in different periods or in the same periods in different years.\nSuppliers who have historically grown tobacco and from whom we have purchased tobacco may elect to grow other crops instead of tobacco, which affects the world supply of tobacco and may impact our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nIncreases in the prices for other crops have led and may in the future lead suppliers who have historically grown tobacco, and from whom we have purchased tobacco, to elect to grow these other, more profitable, items instead of tobacco. A decrease in the volume of tobacco available for purchase may increase the purchase price of such tobacco. As a result, we could experience an increase in tobacco crop acquisition costs which may impact our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nOur advancement of inputs to tobacco suppliers could expose us to losses.\nAdvances to tobacco suppliers are settled as part of the consideration paid upon the suppliers delivering us unprocessed tobacco at market prices. Two primary factors determine the market value of the tobacco suppliers deliver to us: the quantity of tobacco delivered and the quality of the tobacco delivered. Unsatisfactory quantities or quality of the tobacco delivered could result in losses with respect to advances to our tobacco suppliers or the deferral of those advances.\nWhen we purchase tobacco directly from suppliers, we bear the risk that the tobacco will not meet our customers\u2019 quality and quantity requirements.\nIn countries where we contract directly with tobacco suppliers, we bear the risk that the tobacco delivered will not meet quality and quantity requirements of our customers. If the tobacco does not meet such market requirements, we may not be able to sell the tobacco we agreed to buy and may not be able to meet all of our customers\u2019 orders, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWeather and other conditions can affect the marketability of our inventory.\nLike other agricultural products, the quality of tobacco is affected by weather and the environment, which can change the quality or size of the crop. If a weather event is particularly severe, such as a major drought or hurricane, the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to our customers, which would result in a reduction in revenues. If such an event is also widespread, it could affect our ability to acquire the quantity of products required by customers. In addition, other items can affect the marketability of tobacco, including, among other things, the presence of:\n\u2022\nnon-tobacco related material;\n\u2022\ngenetically modified organisms; and\n\u2022\nexcess residues of pesticides, fungicides and herbicides.\nA significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the tobacco crops we buy could make it difficult for us to sell such tobacco or to fill our customers\u2019 orders. In addition, in the event of climate change, adverse weather patterns could develop in the growing regions in which we purchase tobacco. Such adverse weather patterns could result in more permanent disruptions in the quality and size of the available crop, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe face increased risks of doing business due to the extent of our international operations.\nSome of the countries we do business in do not have stable economies or governments. Our international operations are subject to international business risks, including unsettled political conditions, uncertainty in the enforcement of legal obligations, including the collection of accounts receivable, fraud risks, expropriation, import and export restrictions, exchange controls, inflationary economies, currency risks and risks related to the restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries. These risks are exacerbated in countries where we have advanced substantial sums or guaranteed local loans or lines of credit for the purchase of tobacco from suppliers. For example, in 2006 as a result of the political environment, economic instability, foreign currency controls and governmental regulations in Zimbabwe, we deconsolidated our Zimbabwe subsidiary, Mashonaland Tobacco Company LTD (\"MTC\"). Subsequently, we determined that the significant doubt about our ability to control MTC was eliminated and reconsolidated MTC as of March 31, 2016.\nOur international operations are in areas where the demand is for the export of lower priced tobacco. We have significant investments in our purchasing, processing and exporting operations in Argentina, Brazil, Malawi, Tanzania and Turkey.\nIn recent years, economic problems in certain African countries have received wide publicity related to devaluation and appreciation of the local currency and inflation, including the classification of Malawi's economy as highly inflationary, the shortage of U.S. dollars in Zimbabwe for exchange for local currency equivalents, and fluctuations in the Zimbabwe local currency equivalent exchange rate. Devaluation and appreciation of the local currency and inflation can affect our purchase costs of tobacco and our processing costs. In addition, we conduct business with suppliers and customers in countries that have relatively recently had or may be subject to dramatic political regime change. In the event of such dramatic changes in the government of such countries, we may be unable to continue to operate our business, or adequately enforce legal obligations, after the change in a manner consistent with prior practice.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and we operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations. Although our corporate policy prohibits foreign bribery and we have adopted procedures to promote compliance, there is no assurance that our policy or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we acquire. Failure to comply with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws) could lead to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures (including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies, and controls, the imposition of a compliance monitor at our expense and potential personnel changes and/or disciplinary actions), any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities also could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2010, we entered into settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve their investigations regarding potential criminal and civil violations of the FCPA. The settlements resulted in the disgorgement in profits and fines totaling $19.45 million, which have been paid. Both settlements also required us to retain an independent compliance monitor for a three-year term that was completed September 30, 2013.\nOur exposure to foreign tax regimes, and changes in U.S. or foreign tax regimes, could adversely affect our business.\nWe do business in countries that have tax regimes in which the rules are not clear, are not consistently applied and are subject to sudden change. This is especially true with regard to international transfer pricing. Our earnings could be reduced by the uncertain and changing nature of these tax regimes. Certain of our subsidiaries are and may in the future be involved in tax matters in foreign countries. While the outcome of any of these existing matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we are vigorously defending them and do not currently expect that any of them will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. However, should one or more of these matters be resolved in a manner adverse to our current expectation, the effect on our results of operations for a particular fiscal reporting period could be material.\nWe seek to optimize our tax footprint across all operations in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions alike. These benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Act\u201d) changed corporate tax rates, the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses, among other things. The Tax Act materially impacted the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, resulting in a significant one-time change in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the period in which the Tax Act was is enacted. Other provisions of the Tax Act, including limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) will continue to materially affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The final impact of the Tax Act, including regulations to be adopted thereunder, changes in interpretations, and additional guidance that may be issued, unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions, may reduce certain tax benefits initially considered to be available.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct our business in many countries around the world. Our business is generally conducted in U.S. dollars, as is the business of the leaf tobacco industry as a whole. We generally must purchase tobacco in non-U.S. countries using local currency. As a result, local country operating costs, including the purchasing and processing costs for tobaccos, are subject to the effects of exchange fluctuations of the local currency against the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our costs for purchasing and processing tobacco in such currencies increases. We attempt to minimize such currency risks by matching the timing of our working capital borrowing needs against the tobacco purchasing and processing funds requirements in the currency of the country where the tobacco is grown. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies can significantly affect our operating results.\nIn addition, the devaluation of foreign currencies has resulted and may in the future result in reduced purchasing power from customers whose capital resources are denominated in those currencies. We may incur a loss of business as a result of the devaluation of these currencies now or in the future. For example, there has been a recent widening of the effective exchange rate in the local currency equivalent in Zimbabwe. If this trend continues, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompetition could erode our earnings.\nThe leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on the prices charged for products and services as well as the merchant\u2019s ability to meet customer specifications in the buying, processing and financing of tobacco. In addition, there is competition in all countries to buy the available tobacco. The loss or substantial reduction of any large or significant customer could reduce our earnings.\nIn addition to the two primary global independent publicly held leaf tobacco merchants, the cigarette manufacturers increasingly buy tobacco directly from suppliers. We also face increasing competition from new local and regional independent leaf merchants with low fixed costs and overhead and good customer connections at the local level, where the new entrants have been able to capitalize in the global transition to those markets. Any of these sources of new competition may result in less tobacco available for us to purchase and process in the applicable markets.\nRisks Related to New Business Lines\nOur investments in new business lines as part of our expanded business strategy have been in companies with limited histories that are operating in newly developing markets and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nOur investments, including indirect investments, in FIGR East, FIGR Norfolk, Criticality, Purilum, Nicotine River, and Humble Juice (collectively, the \"new business lines\") and the operation of these businesses, involve a high degree of risk. These investments are in businesses with limited operating histories and are dependent upon receipt of requisite licenses and approvals. We cannot assure you that as these operations further develop they will be profitable or otherwise sustainable. While certain of these businesses involve the cultivation and/or processing of agricultural products similar in certain ways to leaf tobacco, and accordingly share\ncommonality with our agronomy, traceability and agricultural product processing expertise, they are subject to commercial and regulatory challenges different from our historical businesses and with respect to which we do not have the same level of experience. In addition, these businesses are subject to numerous additional risks and uncertainties, including those specified in the risk factors below.\nCannabis for adult use was only recently legalized in Canada. As a result, the industry and the regulations governing the industry are rapidly developing, and if they develop in ways that differ from the Company\u2019s expectations, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe Canadian Cannabis Act federally legalized adult-use (non-medical) cannabis in Canada effective as of October 17, 2018. Under the Canadian Cannabis Act, each province and territory of Canada has the ability to separately regulate the distribution and sale of cannabis within such province or territory, and the laws (including associated regulations) adopted by each province and territory may vary significantly. Each Canadian province and territory has enacted and implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult use; however, there is no guarantee that provincial and territorial legislation regulating the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult use, or the application and enforcement of such legislation, will not change in the future. Any such change could result in significant additional compliance or other costs and may make participation in such markets uneconomical. Since cannabis was only recently legalized in Canada, there may be inconsistencies in the interpretation and enforcement of the Canadian Cannabis Act and associated provincial and territorial rules and regulations. In addition, Health Canada has experienced delays in approving applications for new licenses, capacity expansions and employee security checks, including with respect to the Norfolk Expansion and the Charlottetown Expansion, and the approval of certain members of management to perform functions requiring regulatory approval. Additional inconsistencies, changes or delays could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk.\nIn addition, regulations are continuing to be developed for different aspects of the adult-use cannabis industry in Canada. For example, the Canadian federal government has published draft regulations governing the production and consumption of edible cannabis and cannabis-derived products (such as cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals), the sale of which is not currently permissible. If FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk begins to offer edible cannabis products once such products are legalized, they will need to assess the final rules and regulations. The regulations and market for such products and adult-use cannabis generally may not develop, or may not develop as the Company expects, which could have a material adverse effect on FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn Canada, the federal and provincial or territorial legislation and regulatory regimes for cannabis products also include excise duties payable by licensed cannabis producers on adult-use cannabis products, in addition to goods and services tax or harmonized sales tax in certain provinces and territories. The rate of the excise duties for cannabis products varies by province and territory. Any significant increase in the rate of excise duties on cannabis products in the future could reduce consumer demands for cannabis products and adversely impact the adult-use cannabis industry and market in general. In addition, any increase in the rate of excise duties on cannabis products in the future could reduce the margins and profitability of FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk in the event that they could not, or chose not to, pass along such increases to consumers.\nThe cannabis industry and market are relatively new in Canada, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as anticipated or the Company may ultimately be unable to succeed in this industry and market.\nFIGR East and FIGR Norfolk are operating in a relatively new cannabis industry and market. They face inherent challenges associated with being in a new market, including establishing reliable agricultural supply chains and modernizing processing and manufacturing to compete with other market participants. In addition to being subject to general business risks associated with a business involving an agricultural product and regulated consumer products, these subsidiaries need to continue to build brand awareness in the Canadian adult-use cannabis industry and market through significant investments in strategy, production capacity, quality assurance and compliance with regulations. These activities may not promote their brands and products as effectively as intended, or at all. Competitive conditions, consumer tastes, patient requirements and spending patterns in this new industry and market are relatively unknown and may have unique circumstances that differ from existing industries and markets.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that these industries and markets will continue to exist or grow as currently estimated or anticipated, or function and evolve in a manner consistent with management's expectations and assumptions. Any event or circumstance that affects the legal cannabis industry and markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, the growth of the Canadian adult-use cannabis industry is restricted by limitations on sales and marketing activities imposed by Health Canada, various medical associations, and other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies or voluntary industry associations, which may adversely affect FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s ability to conduct sales and marketing activities and could have a material adverse effect on their businesses, operating results and financial conditions.\nPyxus and its U.S. subsidiaries may be unable to receive any funds generated by FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East and such funds may not be used to fund the payment of obligations of our U.S. based operations.\nPyxus does not currently intend to repatriate any funds generated by FIGR Norfolk or FIGR East\u2019s operations into the United States and certain United States federal laws may restrict it from doing so. Accordingly, funds generated by these subsidiaries\u2019 operations, or in certain circumstances the potential future sale of either or both of these subsidiaries, may not be available to fund the payment of obligations of the Company\u2019s U.S. based operations, including the debt obligations of Pyxus.\nThe market for industrial hemp and CBD in the United States is relatively new and is subject to risks associated with an emerging industry. This industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as anticipated or Criticality may ultimately be unable to succeed in this industry or market.\nThe hemp and CBD industry in the United States is highly speculative and is a new industry which is rapidly expanding and may not be successful. Criticality faces inherent challenges associated with being in a new market, including establishing reliable agricultural supply chains and modernizing processing and manufacturing to compete with producers in other countries where industrial hemp cultivation has already been established. Therefore, Criticality is subject to all of the business risks associated with a new business in a niche market, including risks of unforeseen capital requirements, failure of widespread market acceptance of hemp products, failure to establish business relationships and competitive disadvantages as against larger and more established competitors.\nThe market for e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products is a niche market and is relatively new and emerging. If the market develops more slowly or differently from the Company's expectations, the business, growth prospects and financial condition of the new business lines' vaping business lines could be adversely affected.\nE-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products, having recently been introduced to market, are at an early stage of development and represent a niche market that is evolving rapidly and is characterized by an increasing number of global market entrants. Future sales and any future profits are substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of vaping products. Rapid growth in the use of, and interest in, e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products is recent, and may not continue on a lasting basis. The demand and market acceptance for these products is subject to a high level of uncertainty. Therefore, the new business lines' vaping products business line is subject to all of the business risks associated with a new business in a niche market, including risks of unforeseen capital requirements, failure of widespread market acceptance of e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products, failure to establish business relationships and competitive disadvantages as against larger and more established competitors. Results of operations may be adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity and the demand for e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products. Furthermore, the market for e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products is relatively new and many products may not achieve or sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. While traditional tobacco products are well established and revenue from traditional cigarette sales represents a substantial majority of total industry revenue, smokeless tobacco products and vaping products represent only a small portion of the industry. E-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products may not become widely adopted, or the market for vaping products may not develop as the Company expects. If the market for e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products develops more slowly, or differently from expectations, the business, growth prospects and financial condition of these new business lines may be adversely affected.\nFIGR East and FIGR Norfolk intend to target the premium segment of the Canadian adult-use cannabis market, which may not materialize, or in which they may not be able to develop or maintain a brand that attracts or retains customers.\nFIGR East and FIGR Norfolk intends to target users of cannabis in the Canadian adult-use cannabis market who are looking for premium products. However, such a market may not materialize or be sustainable. If this premium market does materialize, they may not be successful in creating and maintaining consumer perceptions of the value of their premium products. The promotion of cannabis is strictly regulated in Canada. For example, promotion is largely restricted to the place of sale and subject to prescribed conditions set out in the Canadian Cannabis Act and the Canadian Cannabis Regulations. Among other restrictions, the Canadian Cannabis Act prohibits testimonials and endorsements, lifestyle branding and promotion that is appealing to young persons. Such restrictions on advertising, marketing and the use of logos and brand names, and other restrictions on advertising imposed by Canadian federal or provincial laws or regulations, or similar regulations imposed in other jurisdictions, may prevent FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk from creating and maintaining consumer perceptions in the value of their premium products and establishing themselves as premium producers. If FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk cannot successfully enter into or compete in the premium market, they may face significant challenges in gaining or maintaining a market share in Canada or they may be forced to sell their respective products at a lower price, which may materially adversely affect their respective revenues.\nThe success of FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk depends, in part, on their ability to attract and retain customers who in turn sell to ultimate consumers of cannabis and cannabis-related products. To do this, FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk are dependent upon, among other things, continually producing desirable and effective products and the continued growth in the aggregate number of adult-use cannabis consumers. FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk have made significant investments in enhancing their brands to attract consumers. Subject to the applicable legal restrictions, the Company expects that they will continue to make significant investments to promote their current products to new consumers and new products to current and new consumers. Such campaigns can be expensive and may not result in increased sales. If FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk are unable to attract new consumers, they may not be able to increase their sales.\nChanges in laws, regulations and guidelines in Canada pertaining to cannabis may adversely affect FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East.\nOn October 17, 2018, the Canadian Cannabis Act legalizing recreational adult use of cannabis nationwide came into effect. Uncertainty remains, however, with respect to the implementation of regulations under the Canadian Cannabis Act that will govern the sale and use of cannabis-related products as well as the various provincial and territorial regimes governing the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. The impact of these laws, regulations and guidelines on the businesses of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East, including increased costs of compliance and other potential risks remain uncertain and, accordingly, may cause FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East to experience adverse effects.\nTo date, only fresh cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis plants, cannabis seeds, and cannabis oil products are permitted for sale in Canada. Pursuant to the Canadian Cannabis Act, certain classes of cannabis products, such as edibles, extracts, and topicals are currently prohibited from sale, but the federal government in Canada has expressed its intention to permit such products for sale by October 17, 2019. While draft regulations have been released, the impact of these regulatory changes on the business of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East is unknown, and the proposed regulations may not be implemented at all or, if they are, may change significantly.\nIn addition, the Canadian Cannabis Act allows for licenses to be granted for outdoor cultivation and Health Canada commenced granting outdoor cultivation licenses in May 2019. The implications of permitting outdoor cultivation are not yet known, but outdoor cultivation could reduce start-up capital required for new entrants in the cannabis industry, or permit lower cost expansions by existing industry participants as capital expenditure requirements related to outdoor growing are typically much lower than those associated with indoor growing. Similarly, it may also ultimately lower prices. Accordingly, competition from firms holding outdoor cultivation licenses may have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operation of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East.\nAs the Canadian cannabis industry continues to develop, competition from market participants may have a negative impact on FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s business and financial condition.\nAs the Canadian adult-use cannabis market continues to mature, consumers who once solely relied on the medical cannabis market may shift some, or all, of their consumption away from medical cannabis and towards adult-use cannabis, resulting in increased levels of competition in the adult-use cannabis market. As the adult-use cannabis market continues to mature, the entry of new competitors may also increase the level of competition in the cannabis market as a whole. This increase in competition may have a negative impact on FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk.\nFIGR Norfolk and FIGR East face competition from existing license holders licensed under the Canadian Cannabis Act. Certain of these competitors may have significantly greater financial, production, marketing, R&D and technical, and human resources than the Company does. As a result, FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s competitors may be more successful in gaining market penetration and market share in the adult-use cannabis industry in than the Canada. FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s commercial opportunity in the adult-use cannabis market could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors produce and commercialize products for the adult-use market that, among other things, are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than the products that FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East may produce, have greater sales, marketing and distribution support than FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s products, enjoy enhanced timing of market introduction and perceived effectiveness advantages over FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s products and receive more favorable publicity FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s products. If FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s adult-use cannabis products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by the adult-use cannabis market, FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and their businesses may not become profitable.\nFurther, the cannabis industry in Canada is undergoing rapid growth and substantial change, which has resulted in an increase in competitors, consolidation and formation in Canada of strategic relationships. Such acquisitions or other consolidating transactions could harm FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk in a number of ways, including by losing strategic partners if the partners are acquired by or enter into relationships with a competitor, losing customers, revenue and market share, or forcing them to expend greater resources to meet new or additional competitive threats, all of which could harm their operating results. As competitors enter the market and become increasingly sophisticated, competition in FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s industry may intensify and place downward pressure on retail prices for their products and services, which could negatively impact their profitability.\nThe Canadian Cannabis Act allows individuals in Canada to cultivate, propagate, harvest and distribute up to four cannabis plants per household, despite certain provincial restrictions, provided that each plant meets certain requirements. If FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East is unable to effectively compete with other suppliers to the adult-use cannabis market, or a significant number of individuals take advantage of the ability to cultivate and use their own cannabis, FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s success in the adult-use cannabis business in Canada may be limited and may not fulfill the expectations of management.\nIf the number of users of medical and/or adult-use cannabis in Canada increases, the demand for products will increase and the Company expects that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number\nof diversified products. In addition, the legal landscape for medical and adult-use cannabis is changing internationally. More countries have passed laws that allow for the production and distribution of medical cannabis in some form or another, and some of these countries may pass laws allowing for the production and distribution of adult-use cannabis as well. Increased international competition could materially adversely affect FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s business, operations, or growth prospects.\nFIGR Norfolk and FIGR East also face competition from licensed producers that may not fully comply with applicable regulations. Such producers may have lower operating costs, make impermissible claims and utilize other competitive advantages based on circumvention of regulatory requirements. Furthermore, FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk also face competition from the illicit cannabis market. Illegal dispensaries and \u201cblack market\u201d operations and participants, despite not having a valid license under the Canadian Cannabis Regulations, may be able to (i) offer products with higher concentrations of active ingredients than FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk are authorized to produce and sell, (ii) use delivery methods, including edibles, concentrates and extract vaporizers, that the FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk are currently prohibited from offering to individuals in Canada, (iii) brand products more explicitly, (iv) sell products at lower prices and (v) market products in ways not permissible by law. As these illicit market participants do not comply with the regulations governing the cannabis industry in Canada, their operations may also have significantly lower costs.\nTo remain competitive while complying with regulatory requirements, FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East will require continued significant investment in research and development, marketing, sales and customer support. FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and customer support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East.\nGiven the rapid changes affecting global, national, and regional economies generally and the cannabis industry, in particular, FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Their success will depend on their ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, regulatory conditions, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Any failure by FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on their respective financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow, and operational performance.\nThe new business lines will be constrained by law in marketing certain of their respective products.\nThe development of the new business lines may be hindered by applicable regulatory restrictions on sales and marketing activities. For example, the Canadian federal regulatory regime includes plain packaging requirements. Among other things, the packaging of cannabis products may not include brand names or images, logos that promote cannabis, designs appealing to youth, testimonials or endorsements or lifestyle branding. The restriction on the use of logos and brand names on cannabis products could have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East, as it may be difficult to establish brand loyalty.\nIf the new business lines are unable to effectively market their respective products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for their respective products, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThere are factors that may prevent FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East from realizing growth targets.\nThe adult-use cannabis industry and market are relatively new in Canada and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as anticipated or FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East may be ultimately unable to succeed in this new industry and market. In addition to being subject to general business risks, each of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East must, subject to regulatory constraints, build brand awareness in this industry and market through significant investments in its strategy, its production capacity, quality assurance and compliance with regulations. Further, facilities expansions contemplated by FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East may not be completed on the schedule anticipated by the Company due to delays in construction, including delays in securing necessary funding, and may not receive necessary licenses and permits to permit operations to commence once construction is completed. In addition, FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East may not be able to attract and retain sufficiently qualified personnel to adequately staff the expanded facilities. It is also possible that the contemplated expansion plans may cost more than anticipated, in which circumstance FIGR Norfolk or FIGR East may curtail, or extend timeframes for completing, the expansion plans. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that this industry and market will continue to exist and grow as currently estimated or anticipated or function and evolve in the manner consistent with management's expectations and assumptions. Any event or circumstance that adversely affects the cannabis industry and market in Canada could have a material adverse effect on the FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East\u2019s respective business and growth opportunities.\nThe market for hemp in the United States is increasingly competitive.\nThe hemp market in the United States is competitive and evolving and Criticality faces strong competition from both existing and emerging companies that offer similar products. Some of Criticality\u2019s current and potential competitors may have longer operating histories, greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than Criticality.\nGiven the rapid changes affecting global, national, and regional economies generally and the hemp and CBD industries, in particular, Criticality may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Criticality\u2019s success will depend on its ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, regulatory conditions, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Any failure by Criticality to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.\nThe number of competitors in the hemp and CBD markets is expected to increase, both in the United States and internationally, which could negatively affect Criticality\u2019s market position and demand for its products. Additionally, the introduction of an adult-use model for non-hemp cannabis production and distribution in various jurisdictions may cause producers in those jurisdictions to develop cannabis-derived CBD products and compete with Criticality\u2019s hemp and CBD products. The impact of this potential development may be negative for Criticality and could result in increased levels of competition in its existing market and/or the entry of new competitors in the overall hemp market in which Criticality operates.\nThe Company may experience intense competition in the e-liquid, vapable oil, and vaping products industries in which it and its joint ventures currently operate.\nThe Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures operating in the e-liquid and vaping products industry may face intense competition from other companies in the vapable products and vapor products industry, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources, market penetration and experience than these subsidiaries. Increased competition by larger and better-financed competitors could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operation of these subsidiaries. Because the e-liquid, vapable oil and vaping products industry has relatively low barriers to entry, the Company expects that its subsidiaries and joint ventures in these businesses to face additional competition from new entrants. To become and remain competitive in this industry, the Company and its joint ventures may require research and development, marketing, sales and support. The Company and its joint ventures may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of this aspect of its business. The competitive environment and the Company's competitive position in this market can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors\u2019 introduction of low-priced products or innovative products, cigarette or e-liquid, vapable oil and other vaping products excise taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate products, restricts consumer access to certain products, such as certain flavored e-liquids, or limits the ability to market products in certain jurisdictions.\nThe Company currently sells, and expects to continue to sell, a significant share of its product to provincial governments through supply contracts that may not generate orders as expected or which may not be renewed.\nUnder the terms of their respective licenses and the Canadian Cannabis Act, FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk are restricted as to whom they can sell their respective cannabis products. They currently, and expects to continue to, derive a significant portion of their revenues from supply agreements with Canadian provincial and territorial governments, including particularly Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Generally, none of their provincial or territorial supply agreements contain purchase commitments or otherwise obligates the purchaser to buy a minimum or fixed volume of products. As a result, the amount of cannabis that these purchasers may purchase under the supply agreements, or its price, may deviate significantly from the Company\u2019s expectations. In addition, FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s revenues could fluctuate materially in the future and could be materially and disproportionately impacted by the purchasing decisions of existing government purchasers and any other future government purchasers. If any of these purchasers decides to purchase lower volumes of products from the amount FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk expect, insists on a price that is lower than FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk expect, alters its purchasing patterns at any time with limited notice, decides not to continue or begin to purchase FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk cannabis products at all or does not renew its agreement with FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk on similar terms or other terms acceptable to them, FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s revenues could be materially adversely affected.\nThe adult-use cannabis market in Canada has experienced, and may in the future experience, supply and demand fluctuations.\nThere has been a shortfall in supply in the Canadian adult-use cannabis market since legalization in October 2018. Such supply shortages have led to increased prices, increases in out-of-stocks and the consumers opting to buy cannabis on the illicit market. Although licensed producers have increased capacity, there is no guarantee that such entities will be able to produce enough cannabis to meet existing demand. Such demand, however, may not be sustained and the increase in production may result in over-supply and lower prices. If FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s inventory levels in the future become greater than consumer demand, they may have to engage in sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impair their brand image. Conversely, if they underestimate demand for their products, they may experience inventory shortages, which might delay shipments\nto customers, reduce revenue, negatively impact customer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. In addition, demand for cannabis and cannabis products is dependent on a number of social, political and economic factors that are beyond their control, including the novelty of legalization, which may wear off. A material decline in the economic conditions affecting consumers can cause a reduction in disposable income for the average consumer, change consumption patterns and result in a reduction in spending on cannabis products or a switch to other products obtained through illicit channels. Market demand for cannabis may not continue to be sufficient to support the FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s current or future production levels, and FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable.\nConsumer perception and reputational risk associated with the cannabis industry may negatively affect FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East's business activities.\nWe believe that the Canadian cannabis legal use market is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the cannabis produced. Consumer perception can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of cannabis products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the cannabis market or any particular product, or consistent with currently held views. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the cannabis industry and demand for its products and services, which could affect the business, results of operations and cash flows of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East. FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East's dependence upon consumer perception means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East and their respective business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, adverse publicity, reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of cannabis in general, or associating the consumption of cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could have a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers' failure to consume such products legally, appropriately, or as directed.\nIn addition, parties outside of the cannabis industry in Canada with which the Company does business may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East's cannabis business activities. For example, the Company could receive a notification from a financial institution advising it that the financial institution would no longer maintain banking relationships with those in the cannabis industry, even though the Company\u2019s involvement is through indirect, separately managed foreign subsidiaries. It is possible that the Company may in the future have difficulty establishing or maintaining bank accounts or other business relationships that it needs to operate its business. Failure to establish or maintain such business relationships could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nFuture clinical research studies on the effects of cannabis, hemp, and vapable products, among others, may lead to conclusions that dispute or conflict with the Company's understanding and belief regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of such products.\nResearch in Canada, the United States, and internationally regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids, such as CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol (\u201cTHC\u201d), remains in early stages. There have been relatively few studies conducted to determine the benefits, safety and side effects of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids (such as CBD and THC).\nAlthough the Company believes that the articles, reports and studies support its beliefs regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of cannabis, future research and clinical trials may prove such articles, reports and studies to be incorrect, or could raise concerns regarding, and perceptions relating to, cannabis. Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, undue reliance should not be placed on such articles and reports.\nFuture research studies and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions, or reach negative conclusions, regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing, social acceptance or other facts and perceptions related to cannabis use, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for products containing THC or CBD with the potential to lead to a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company believes the hemp and CBD industries in the United States are highly dependent upon positive consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy, and quality of hemp-derived products, as well as consumer views concerning regulatory compliance and perceived similarities or differences between hemp and marihuana. Consumers, vendors, landlords/lessors, industry partners or third-party service providers may incorrectly perceive hemp products as marihuana thereby confusing them for having the high THC content of marihuana or for being illegal under U.S. federal law.\nIf the Company chooses to engage in research, development, and marketing activities outside of Canada, controlled substance legislation may restrict or limit the Company's ability to research, manufacture and develop a commercial market for its products.\nApproximately 250 substances, including cannabis, are listed in the Schedules annexed to the UN Single Convention, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (Vienna, 1971) and the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (introducing control on precursors) (Vienna, 1988). The purpose of these listings is to control and limit the use of these drugs according to a classification of their therapeutic value, risk of abuse and health dangers, and to minimize the diversion of precursor chemicals to illegal drug manufacturers. The 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended in 1972, classifies cannabis as Schedule I (\u201csubstances with addictive properties, presenting a serious risk of abuse\u201d) and as Schedule IV (\u201cthe most dangerous substances, already listed in Schedule I, which are particularly harmful and of extremely limited medical or therapeutic value\u201d) narcotic drug. The 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances classifies THC-the principal psychoactive cannabinoid of cannabis-as a Schedule I psychotropic substance (substances presenting a high risk of abuse, posing a particularly serious threat to public health which are of very little or no therapeutic value). Many countries are parties to these conventions, which govern international trade and domestic control of these substances, including cannabis. They may interpret and implement their obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to subsidiaries of the Company obtaining manufacturing and/or marketing approval for its products in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit such products to be manufactured, researched, and/or marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time.\nThere are limited long-term data with respect to the efficacy and side effects of the new business lines\u2019 products.\nIf the products of the new business lines of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures are not perceived to have the effects intended by the end user, the Company's business may suffer. Certain of these products contain hemp extract and other ingredients and may qualify in the United States as dietary supplements. Moreover, many of these products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. There are limited long-term data with respect to efficacy, unknown side effects and/or interaction of these substances with human or animal biochemistry. As a result, these products could have unexpected side effects, the discovery of which could materially and adversely affect the Company's, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn particular, the rapid development of e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products has not provided sufficient time for the medical profession to study the long-term health effects of using such products. Therefore, it is uncertain as to whether or not e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products are safe for their intended use. If the medical profession were to determine that using e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products posed a significant threat to long-term human health, consumption could decline rapidly and the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures may be forced to modify certain or all of their respective, e-liquids, vapable oils and other vaping products. Such an outcome may have material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, and results of operations\nChanging consumer preferences may adversely affect consumer retention and results of operations.\nAs a result of changing consumer preferences, many dietary supplements and other innovative products attain financial success for a limited period of time. Even if the products of the Company\u2019s new business lines find retail success, there can be no assurance that any of these products will continue to see extended financial success. The Company's success will be significantly dependent upon its ability to develop new and improved product lines and to adapt to consumer preferences. Even if it is successful in introducing new products or developing current products, a failure to gain consumer acceptance or to update products with compelling content could cause a decline in popularity of these products that could reduce revenues and harm the Company's brands, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to introduce new features and product lines and to achieve and sustain market acceptance could result in the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures being unable to satisfy consumer preferences and generate revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s new business lines depends on their ability to attract and retain consumers. There are many factors which could impact their ability to attract and retain consumers, including its ability to continually produce desirable and effective products, the successful implementation of consumer acquisition plans and the continued growth in the aggregate number of potential consumers. Failure of the Company\u2019s new business lines to acquire and retain consumers could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Canadian legal adult-use cannabis industry is in its early stages of development and it is likely that FIGR East, FIGR Norfolk and their competitors, will seek to introduce new products in the future. In attempting to keep pace with any new market developments, FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk may need to spend significant amounts of capital in order to successfully develop and generate revenues from new products that they introduce. As well, they may be required to obtain additional regulatory approvals from Health Canada and any other applicable regulatory authorities, which may take significant amounts of time. FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk may not be successful in developing effective and safe new products, anticipating shifts in social trends and consumer demands, bringing such products to market in time to be effectively commercialized, or obtaining any required\nregulatory approvals, which, together with any capital expenditures made in the course of such product development and regulatory approval processes, may have a material adverse effect on their business and results of operations and on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition, the patterns of cannabis consumption in Canada and elsewhere in the world may shift over time due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographics, social trends, public health polices and other leisure or consumption behaviors. If consumer preferences for FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s products or cannabis products in general do not develop, or if once developed they were to move away from FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s products or cannabis products in general, or if FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk is unable to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behaviors, they and the Company may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures are subject risks related to the retail distribution of their respective products.\nRetail chains typically procure products in defined cycles depending on their internal procurement needs. If the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures engaged in the new business lines are successful in obtaining retail distribution for their products, they will be subject to the cyclical nature of the procurement strategies of their respective retail partners.\nFurther, in order to sell cannabis via retail outlets in certain provinces in Canada, FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East will have to be successful in obtaining government contracts. There can be no assurance that FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East will be successful in obtaining sufficient government contracts to satisfy the Company\u2019s business plan.\nTrade of cannabis for non-medical purposes within Canada may be restricted by the Canadian Free Trade Agreement.\nFIGR East has entered into certain supply agreements for the supply of adult-use cannabis and cannabis derivative products. The Canadian Free Trade Agreement, which generally reduces or eliminates the barriers to the free movement of persons, goods, services, and investments within Canada, specifically excludes cannabis for non-medical purposes from its scope and instead leaves the intra-Canadian movement of non-medical cannabis to future negotiations among the provinces and territories. There is a risk that the outcome of the negotiations will result in the interprovincial and interterritorial trade of cannabis for non-medical purposes in Canada being entirely restricted or subject to conditions that will negatively impact the ability of FIGR East (and, when licensed, FIGR Norfolk) to sell cannabis in provinces and territories in which they do not have cultivation and production facilities, including those in which FIGR East has already executed agreements or been approved to supply cannabis to retailers.\nThe Company\u2019s new business lines may be unable to maintain or promote the reputation of their respective brands or incur excessive expense in doing so.\nManagement believes that maintaining and promoting the respective brands of the new business lines is critical to expanding their respective customer bases. Maintaining and promoting such brands will depend largely on the ability of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures engaged in the new business lines to continue to provide quality, reliable and innovative products, which they may not do successfully. Such subsidiaries and joint ventures may introduce new products or services that their respective customers do not like, which may negatively affect their respective brand and reputation. Maintaining and enhancing these brands may require substantial investments, and these investments may not achieve the desired goals. In addition, regulation restrictions in Canada mandating plain packaging and generally prohibiting promotional activities may inhibit FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East's ability to develop their brands and reputations If the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures fail to successfully promote and maintain their respective brands or incur excessive expenses in this effort, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe industries in which the new business lines operate are highly regulated and the Company may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where the Company carries on business.\nThe Company's new business lines are heavily regulated in all jurisdictions where they carry on business. For example, the operations of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East are subject to various laws, regulations and guidelines by governmental authorities (including Health Canada) relating to the manufacture, marketing, management, transportation, storage, sale, pricing and disposal of cannabis and cannabis oil, and also including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, insurance coverage, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. Laws and regulations, applied generally, grant government agencies and self-regulatory bodies broad administrative discretion over such activities, including the power to limit or restrict business activities as well as impose additional disclosure requirements on these products and services.\nAchievement of the Company's business objectives is contingent, in part, upon compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by all relevant governmental authorities and obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals for the production, storage, transportation, sale, import and export, as applicable, of the products of its subsidiaries and joint ventures. The commercial cannabis industry is still a new industry and, in Canada, in particular, the Canadian Cannabis Act is a new regime that has no close precedent in Canadian law. The effect of relevant governmental authorities' administration, application and enforcement of their respective regulatory regimes and delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals which may be required may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to the operations of the new business lines may lead to possible sanctions including the revocation or imposition of additional conditions on licenses to operate; the suspension or expulsion from a particular market or jurisdiction or of key personnel; the imposition of additional or more stringent inspection, testing and reporting requirements; and the imposition of fines and censures. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to operations, increase compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities or a revocation of licenses and other permits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, governmental authorities may change their administration, application or enforcement procedures at any time, which may adversely impact the ongoing costs relating to regulatory compliance.\nThe new business lines are reliant on obtaining licenses, authorizations, approvals, and permits for each of its businesses.\nEach of the new business lines is required to obtain and maintain certain licenses, approvals and permits in the jurisdictions where its products are produced, licensed or sold. There can be no assurance all necessary licenses, approvals and permits will be obtained and maintained. Failure to obtain such licenses, permits or approvals may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEach of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East is reliant on obtaining licenses, authorizations, approvals, and permits for its ability to grow, store and sell cannabis and other products derived therefrom. Such licenses, if obtained, are subject to ongoing compliance, reporting and renewal requirements.\nFIGR Norfolk and FIGR East operate their businesses pursuant to the licenses granted by applicable regulatory authorities, including Health Canada. FIGR Norfolk has applied to Health Canada to amend its licenses to: (i) permit sale of dried cannabis, and (ii) to include a standard processing license. FIGR Norfolk will also be required to apply to Health Canada for an amendment to its licenses in respect of the Norfolk Expansion. FIGR East will be required to apply to Health Canada in respect of the Charlottetown Expansion. The ability of each of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East to grow, process, store, and sell cannabis in Canada is dependent on its licenses from Health Canada, and in particular sales and cultivation licenses. Failure to comply with the requirements of the licenses or failure to obtain or maintain the relevant licenses would have a material adverse impact on their respective business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no guarantee that Health Canada will issue or renew the licenses or, if they are issued or renewed, that they will be not be revoked or renewed on the same or similar terms. Should the FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East fail to obtain the licenses, or should FIGR Norfolk or FIGR East later renew its licenses on different terms or not allow for anticipated capacity increases, or should the licenses be revoked, their respective business, financial condition, and results of the operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn the United States, despite cannabis possession and use having been legalized at the state level for medical use in many states and for adult-use in a number of states, most forms of cannabis (other than industrial hemp) continue to be categorized as Schedule I controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act and subject to the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (\"CSIEA\"). The Company does not intend to grow, cultivate, manufacture, or distribute non-hemp cannabis in the United States, or to export any cannabis grown or cannabis products in Canada to the United States, while such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations, such as the Controlled Substances Act and the CSIEA, could result in civil, criminal and/or administrative enforcement actions, which could result in fines, penalties, and other sanctions, including but not limited to, cessation of business activities. While FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East have received confirmation from Health Canada that their intended method of cannabinoid production is permitted under the Canadian Cannabis Act, the Canadian Cannabis Act is new legislation and may be subject to changes in interpretation over time. In addition, while the Company intends to produce and distribute cannabinoids in additional jurisdictions as such production and distribution is or becomes lawful, there can be no guarantee that the Company\u2019s operations in such jurisdictions will obtain the relevant licenses, permits and approvals to produce and distribute such products or derivative products in any jurisdiction.\nAdditional government licenses are currently, and in the future may be, required in connection with the operations of the new business lines or the further expansion of the new business lines. To the extent such permits and approvals are required and not obtained, the Company may be prevented from operating and/or expanding its business, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to uncertainty regarding legal and regulatory status and changes.\nAchievement of the Company's business objectives is contingent, in part, upon compliance by the new business lines with regulatory requirements enacted by governmental authorities and their obtaining required regulatory approvals. The Company cannot predict the timeline required for the new business lines to secure all appropriate regulatory approvals, or the extent of testing and documentation that may be required by governmental authorities. Any delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain, required regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, and financial condition of the Company. The new business lines will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or in restrictions on operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to\nmaterial liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nFor example, while the production of cannabis in Canada is under the regulatory oversight of the Government of Canada, the distribution of adult-use cannabis in Canada is the responsibility of the provincial and territorial governments. The distribution and sale of adult-use cannabis in Ontario is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act, 2017, the Cannabis Licence Act, 2018 and the related regulations. The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation is the wholesale distributor of cannabis and conducts all online sales in the province. Private retail has been permitted since April 2019 and is regulated by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (\u201cAGCO\u201d). Initially, the number of private stores licensed by the AGCO will be limited to twenty-five as the initial cannabis supply stabilizes. The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation provides online sales of adult-use cannabis in the interim. The impact of this new legislative regime, and of the legislation regulating adult-use cannabis passed in other provinces and territories, on the cannabis industry and the Company's business plans and operations is uncertain. There is no guarantee that Canadian provincial legislation regulating the retail distribution and sale of cannabis for adult use purposes will remain unchanged or that it will be implemented in a way that is favorable to FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East. It is possible for significant legislative amendments to be enacted in each province to address any current or future regulatory issues or perceived inadequacies in the distribution of cannabis. There is no guarantee that Canadian provincial or territorial legislation regulating the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes will create the growth opportunities that are currently anticipated by FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East.\nChanges in the regulations governing medical cannabis outside of Canada may adversely impact the Company's prospects.\nThe Company's growth strategy with respect to international expansion of the new business lines continues to evolve as regulations governing the medical cannabis and industrial hemp industries in the foreign jurisdictions become more fully developed. Interpretation of these laws, rules and regulations and their application is ongoing. Amendments to current laws, regulations and guidelines, more stringent implementation or enforcement thereof, enactment of new laws, the adoption of new regulations, or other unanticipated events, including changes in political regimes and attitudes toward cannabis and industrial hemp, are beyond the Company's control and could material adverse effect on the Company's international growth prospects.\nFurthermore, additional countries continue to pass laws that allow for the production and distribution of cannabis for medical purposes in one form or another. International competition and limitations placed on FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East by Canadian regulations might lower the demand for any future Company products on a global scale.\nWe cannot assure you that the Company will be able to expand cannabis operations into legal jurisdictions outside of Canada, and any such expansion will be subject to risks.\nThere can be no assurance that any market for cannabis products to be offered by subsidiaries of the Company will develop in any jurisdiction outside of Canada. Laws, regulations, and perceptions pertaining to cannabis vary widely internationally, and the scope or pace of legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis cannot be predicted or assured. If and when additional legal markets for cannabis develop, the Company\u2019s pursuit of such markets may expose it to new or unexpected risks or significantly increase its exposure to one or more existing risk factors, including economic instability, changes in laws and regulations and the effects of competition. These factors may limit the Company's capability to successfully expand the operations of its subsidiaries into such jurisdictions and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company will become subject to further laws and regulations as it expands internationally.\nThe Company may expand the new business lines internationally. If such international expansion occurs, the Company would become subject to the laws and regulations of (as well as international treaties among) the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates or imports or exports products or materials. In addition, the Company may avail itself of proposed legislative changes in certain jurisdictions to expand its product portfolio, which expansion may include business and regulatory compliance risks as yet undetermined. Failure by the Company to comply with the current or evolving regulatory framework in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is the possibility that any such international jurisdiction could determine that the Company was not or is not compliant with applicable local regulations. If the Company's historical or current sales or operations were found to be in violation of such international regulations the Company may be subject to enforcement actions in such jurisdictions including, but not limited to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of the Company's operations or asset seizures and the denial of regulatory applications, each of such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nViolations of applicable law by FIGR Norfolk or FIGR East, including an unlawful transfer of cannabis inventory to jurisdictions, including the United States, in which the sale of such product is unlawful or within Canada other than for permitted use, may subject Pyxus to potential criminal sanctions.\nEach of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East is required to comply concurrently with a variety of federal, state or provincial, and local laws in each jurisdiction where it operates, or to which it exports or propose to export its products, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, conduct or operations and the production, management, transportation, storage and disposal of our\nproducts and of certain material used in our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires concurrent compliance with complex federal, provincial or state and local laws. These laws change frequently and may be difficult to interpret and apply. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires the investment of significant financial and managerial resources, and a determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could harm our brand image and business. Moreover, it is impossible for the Company to predict the cost or effect of such laws, regulations or guidelines upon their future operations.\nUnder current U.S. federal law, it is unlawful to operate a business from the U.S. that engages in the possession, manufacture, distribution, and/or sale of a controlled substance, including cannabis, in a foreign country where such activities are illegal. Although the Company anticipates that FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East will take precautions to ensure that their operations remain in compliance with all Canadian laws that might apply to such operations, operational decisions of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East will be made by personnel not located in the United States, and funding of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East, to the extent any additional funding is required, would be made by subsidiaries not located in the United States, there is a risk that if FIGR Norfolk or FIGR East were to violate Canadian federal, provincial or local law with respect to the manufacture, distribution, and/or sale of cannabis, including an unlawful transfer of cannabis inventory to jurisdictions, including the United States, in which the sale of such product is unlawful or within Canada other than for permitted use, that may subject Pyxus, its officers, directors, and other parties to potential criminal sanctions, and civil fines, forfeitures, and penalties in the United States.\nFurther, under current U.S. law, it is unlawful to import controlled substances, including marihuana (that is, cannabis plants, plant parts, or derivatives that do not qualify as either hemp, the mature stalks of non-hemp plants, the sterilized seeds of non-hemp plants, or derivatives of such mature stalks or seeds), into the United States, or to transport controlled substances through U.S. territorial waters, on U.S. flagged vessels and U.S. registered aircraft, or accompanied by U.S. citizens or resident aliens. Accordingly, there is a risk that if FIGR Norfolk or FIGR East were to violate U.S. federal or state law with respect to the manufacture, distribution, sale and/or transport of cannabis, even outside the United States, that may subject Pyxus to potential criminal sanctions, civil fines, forfeitures, and other penalties in the United States.\nIn addition, United States federal and state laws applicable to the Company\u2019s indirect investment in FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East is subject to evolving interpretations. Although the Company does not believe that the proposed activities of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East would result in a violation of United States federal or state laws by the Company or our United States-based subsidiaries, the Company cannot provide assurance that United States federal or state law enforcement agencies may not adopt different interpretations of applicable law or that the Company\u2019s view of prevailing applicable law will be upheld if challenged. For example, although the Company disagrees with the position of the Drug Enforcement Agency (the \u201cDEA\u201d) as to its investments in FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East, a spokesperson for the DEA has previously stated that an investment in Canadian cannabis businesses by U.S.-based companies and investors may violate U.S. federal law.\nThe industrial hemp industry in the United States is governed by various federal, state and local agencies and Criticality may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements.\nThe production, labeling and distribution of hemp products are regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings, which could restrict the permissible scope of Criticality's marketing claims or its ability to sell its products in the future. The FDA regulates Criticality's products, without limitation, by ensuring that the products are not adulterated or misbranded and by regulating the marketing claims made about such products. Criticality could be subject to regulation by the DEA and other agencies depending on the manner in which it manufactures and sells hemp and CBD products. Federal agencies, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") and U.S. Department of Justice, and state agencies charged with developing and implementing state hemp plans, also regulate the hemp products that Criticality distributes.\nThe 2018 Farm Bill provides that each state wishing to assert primary regulatory jurisdiction over the production of hemp in that state must submit a hemp plan to the USDA for approval. If a state does not elect to submit a hemp plan or does not obtain federal approval of one, hemp producers in that state must comply with USDA's umbrella hemp plan, under which hemp producers must obtain federal licenses. As of the date of this report, the USDA has not yet developed such a plan or begun to issue licenses. Until such time as the USDA develops its own hemp plan or approves a state hemp plan, hemp cultivation is governed by the more restrictive 2014 Farm Bill, and subject to further requirements imposed by federal law and applicable state industrial hemp pilot program requirements.\nThe compliance environment is rapidly developing and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different regulations in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that Criticality may violate one or more of the requirements. If Criticality's operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations, Criticality may be subject to negative consequences, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of Criticality\u2019s operations, asset seizures, revocation or imposition of additional conditions on licenses to operate its business, the denial of regulatory applications (including by other regulatory regimes that rely on the positions of the DEA and FDA in the application of their respective regimes), the suspension or expulsion from a particular market or jurisdiction or of Criticality's key personnel, or the imposition of additional or more stringent inspection, testing and reporting requirements, any\nof which could adversely affect Criticality\u2019s business and financial results. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to Criticality's operations, increase compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities or a revocation of Criticality's licenses and other permits, which could have a material adverse effect on Criticality's business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, governmental authorities may change their administration, application or enforcement procedures at any time, which may adversely impact the Criticality's ongoing costs relating to regulatory compliance.\nAdditionally, Criticality\u2019s advertising is subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act as well as subject to regulation by the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, including as amended by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (\"DSHEA\"), and by state agencies under analogous state laws. In recent years, the FTC, the FDA and state agencies have initiated numerous investigations of food and dietary supplement products both because of their CBD content and based on allegedly deceptive or misleading marketing claims that cannot be made for these categories of products (for example, disease prevention or treatment claims). At any point, enforcement strategies of a given agency can change as a result of other litigation in the space or changes in political landscapes, and could result in increased enforcement efforts, which would materially affect Criticality\u2019s business. Additionally, some states also permit content, advertising and labeling laws to be enforced by state attorney generals, who may seek civil and criminal penalties, relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and recalls of products sold by Criticality. Private litigations may also seek relief for consumers, class action certifications, class-wide damages and recalls of products sold by Criticality. Any actions against Criticality by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on the Company's profitability.\nThe regulations promulgated under the 2018 Farm Bill may not be favorable to Criticality\u2019s business.\nFederal regulations under the 2018 Farm Bill have not yet been promulgated. Similarly, North Carolina, where Criticality is based, has not yet proposed or submitted for USDA approval a hemp plan under the 2018 Farm Bill. There is no guarantee that such regulations will be on terms favorable to Criticality\u2019s business. Should the regulations result in stricter requirements on Criticality than those of the 2014 Farm Bill, such changes could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations\nChanges, regulations, and guidelines in the United States in federal and state laws pertaining to hemp may adversely affect Criticality.\nContinued development of the hemp industry in the United States will be dependent upon new legislative authorization of hemp at the state level, the states' adoption and USDA approval of plans for hemp production, and further amendment or supplementation of legislation at the federal level. Various events or circumstances could slow or halt progress in the hemp industry and continued growth is not assured. The legislative process(es) related to hemp within the various states in which Criticality has a business interest may be adversely affected by negative public perception of the hemp industry, the pursuit of policy objectives that are inconsistent with the promotion of hemp usage, and any scientific evidence that hemp products are detrimental to human health. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of hemp or CBD, which would negatively affect Criticality's business or growth, including possibly causing Criticality to discontinue operations in the hemp industry as a whole.\nCriticality is subject to uncertainty regarding the legal and regulatory status of hemp, including with respect to U.S. federal and state implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill and related laws, and changes to such laws and regulations may have material adverse effects on the operations of Criticality.\nThe FDA is responsible for ensuring public health and safety through regulation of food, drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, among other products, through its enforcement authority pursuant to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA's responsibilities include regulating ingredients in, as well as the marketing and labeling of, regulated articles sold in interstate commerce.\nThe DEA enforces the Controlled Substances Act, under which cannabis (including hemp and industrial hemp) has historically been controlled as a Schedule I substance as marihuana, with a limited exception for imported parts of the plant that typically contain only trace amounts of cannabinoids (i.e., mature stalks, sterilized seeds, and their derivatives). In 2014, Congress passed the 2014 Farm Bill, which allowed for the domestic cultivation of \"industrial hemp\" (i.e., cannabis plants, plant parts, and derivates with no more than 0.3% THC) as part of agricultural pilot programs adopted by individual states for the purposes of research by state departments of agriculture and institutions of higher education.\nThere is significant uncertainty concerning the permissible scope of commercial activity under the 2014 Farm Bill. The 2014 Farm Bill only authorized institutions of higher education and state agriculture departments to cultivate industrial hemp, and only to do so for research purposes. However, it also gave significant discretion to states to regulate industrial hemp pilot programs. Many states that have adopted pilot programs have registered private companies to cultivate and process industrial hemp. Additionally, many states, including North Carolina, where Criticality is based, have interpreted the 2014 Farm Bill to permit marketing research concerning industrial hemp through, among other things, commercial marketing and sale of industrial hemp and industrial hemp products. In contrast, the DEA, FDA, and USDA have taken the position that, under the 2014 Farm Bill, industrial hemp products may not be sold for the purpose of general commercial activity or in states without agricultural pilot programs that permit their\nsale for research marketing purposes; these agencies have also taken the position that, under the 2014 Farm Bill, industrial hemp plants and seeds may not be transported across state lines. There is evidence that Congress does not agree with these agencies\u2019 interpretation of the 2014 Farm Bill, including through its insertion in various appropriations bills language prohibiting the DEA from using funds to impede state agricultural pilot programs. Such language was inserted in the most recent federal appropriations bill, and has been inserted in the draft appropriations bill being considered by Congress. However, there can be no assurance that the current draft appropriations bill will be passed with such language intact, or that such language will be inserted in future appropriations bills while industrial hemp cultivation continues to be governed by the 2014 Farm Bill. There also can be no assurance that these agencies will change their position concerning the permissible scope of commercial activity under the 2014 Farm Bill.\nOn December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removes \"hemp\" and its derivatives (including its cannabinoids, such as CBD) from the Controlled Substances Act and amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to provide for commercial production of hemp in the United States. The law defines \"hemp\" as \"the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.\"\nThe 2018 Farm Bill tasks the USDA with establishing a regulatory framework for the commercial hemp industry. These responsibilities include, among other things, reviewing and approving state-submitted hemp plans describing the state's regulation of certain aspects of hemp production and establishing requirements for hemp production in states without approved hemp plans (including a federal licensure system). Until such time as the USDA approves state hemp plans or promulgates regulations for hemp production in states without approved plans, hemp production is governed by the more restrictive 2014 Farm Bill, and commercial production of hemp may violate federal law. The timing of such Department of Agriculture actions cannot be assured.\nThere is uncertainty concerning the timing and manner of implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill. As of the date of this report, the USDA has neither approved any state hemp regulatory programs nor established its own umbrella program. Rather, the USDA has deferred review and approval of state plans, establishing its umbrella plan for hemp production in states without approved plans, and issuance of federal licenses to producers in such states until the agency promulgates final implementing regulations. Although the USDA has expressed an intention to issue such final regulations in time for producers to cultivate hemp for commercial purposes during the 2020 growing season and its intention to issue an interim final rule in August 2019, the timing and content of the USDA\u2019s final implementing regulations cannot be assured. Until such time as the USDA issues such final regulations, commercial hemp production under the 2018 Farm Bill cannot legally begin.\nAdditionally, there is uncertainty created by the 2018 Farm Bill\u2019s decision to leave the states as potential primary regulators of hemp production. States may adopt regulatory schemes that impose different levels of regulation and costs on the production of hemp. Because states have not yet adopted approved state plans for hemp production, and cannot do so until the USDA promulgates regulations to review those plans, the timing of the adoption of state plans cannot be assured. Moreover, the 2018 Farm Bill provides that its provisions do not preempt or limit state laws that regulate the production of hemp. Accordingly, some states may choose to restrict or prohibit some or all hemp production or sales.\nFurther, under the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has retained authority over Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act-regulated products containing hemp and its derivatives, including CBD. Moreover, states have retained regulatory authority through their own analogues to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the states may diverge from the federal treatment of the use of hemp as, or in, food or dietary supplements. There can be no assurance that the FDA or states (under their Controlled Substances Act and Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act analogues) will ultimately permit the sale of non-pharmaceutical products containing hemp-derived CBD.\nIn light of recent changes in federal law concerning hemp and in many state laws concerning cannabis, it is possible that there could be future changes to the Controlled Substances Act or DEA policies implementing the Controlled Substances Act. Such changes, if they occurred, could improve the ability to conduct research on the medical benefits of cannabis. If, for example, Congress rescheduled non-hemp cannabis or THC under the Controlled Substances Act as legal but potentially controlled substances, that may materially alter enforcement policies across federal agencies, including the FDA. As federal law generally prohibits the production and sale of non-hemp cannabis and THC, the FDA has historically deferred enforcement related to cannabis to the DEA. However, the FDA has enforced the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act with regard to hemp-derived products, particularly products containing CBD derived from hemp, sold in interstate commerce. If non-hemp cannabis or THC were to be rescheduled in such a way, the FDA could play a more-active regulatory role in enforcing the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act against non-hemp cannabis and THC products, which the FDA could assert qualify as, for example, \"drugs,\" even when not promoted for medical uses. Further, in the event that the pharmaceutical industry directly competes with cannabis businesses for market share, as could potentially occur with rescheduling or even under the current state-law systems, the pharmaceutical industry may urge the DEA, FDA, and others to enforce the Controlled Substances Act, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and related laws against businesses that comply with state but not federal law. Under various contingencies, the potential for multi-agency enforcement could threaten or have a materially adverse effect on the operations of Criticality.\nCriticality may be required to submit a New Dietary Ingredient notification to the FDA, which may not be accepted without objection.\nCriticality could be required to submit a New Dietary Ingredient (\"NDI\") notification to the FDA with respect to hemp extracts. This could depend on whether Criticality can establish that a particular extract was marketed as a dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement prior to October 15, 1994, or is otherwise currently in the food supply in the same chemical form as used in its dietary supplement product. If FDA objects to Criticality's NDI notification, this would have a materially adverse effect upon Criticality and its business.\nThe FDA has issued a Warning Letter to Criticality related to the marketing of CBD as a dietary supplement.\nThe FDA has taken the position that CBD cannot be marketed as a dietary supplement because it has been the subject of investigation as a new drug. The FDA takes the position that a substance is precluded from being marketed as a dietary supplement as of the date on which the FDA authorized its investigation as a new drug (the \"New Drug Preclusion\"). There is evidence that GW Pharmaceuticals plc received authorization for an \"investigation as a new drug\" related to CBD in 2006.\nThe FDA has asserted its New Drug Preclusion position in a Warning Letter to Criticality. Criticality responded to the Warning Letter with its position that CBD was marketed in a dietary supplement or food prior to substantial clinical investigations being instituted and being made public. If the FDA were to enforce the New Drug Preclusion based on its interpretation of the legislation, this would materially and adversely affect Criticality's business and financial condition.\nCriticality may be required to obtain various permits, licenses and approvals in connection with its industrial hemp and hemp business.\nCriticality may be required to obtain and maintain certain permits, licenses and approvals in the jurisdictions where it sources, processes, or sells industrial hemp, hemp, and products derived therefrom. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain or maintain any necessary licenses, permits or approvals. Moreover, Criticality and/or third-party suppliers of CBD hemp oil products could be required to obtain a Controlled Substances Act permit, which would likely not be a feasible option for retail products. Failure to obtain such licenses, permits or approvals, or any material delay in receiving these items is likely to delay and/or inhibit Criticality's ability to conduct its business, and would have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCriticality is licensed to process industrial hemp under North Carolina\u2019s agricultural pilot program. Criticality\u2019s license is subject to ongoing compliance, reporting and renewal requirements. Although Criticality believes it will continue to meet the requirements of North Carolina\u2019s agricultural pilot program, there can be no guarantee that its license will be not be revoked. Should Criticality later renew the license on different terms or not allow for anticipated capacity increases, or should the license be revoked, Criticality's business, financial condition, and results of the operations will be materially adversely affected.\nCriticality may not be able to expand its industrial hemp operations into states other than North Carolina or sell its products commercially or internationally, and any such expansion will be subject to risks.\nCriticality currently processes industrial hemp sourced from and grown by licensed growers operating under North Carolina\u2019s agricultural pilot program. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain the licenses, approvals and authorizations necessary to source industrial hemp from growers located in and operating under the agricultural pilot programs of other states, or to source hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill from growers operating under approved state plans or under the USDA\u2019s umbrella plan. There is no guarantee that federal or state legislation regulating the distribution and sale of industrial hemp and hemp will remain unchanged, will be implemented in a way that is favorable to Criticality, or will permit the commercial sale of hemp and hemp products nationally or internationally. It is possible for significant legislative amendments to be enacted in each state to address any current or future regulatory issues or perceived inadequacies in the distribution of industrial hemp or hemp in the United States. There is no guarantee that federal or state legislation regulating the distribution and sale of industrial hemp and hemp will create the growth opportunities that are currently anticipated by Criticality\nCriticality will become subject to further laws and regulations if and when it expands industrial hemp and hemp operations to other states outside of North Carolina.\nCriticality intends to expand its hemp operations to states other than North Carolina. As a result, it is and will become further subject to the laws and regulations of the states from which it sources industrial hemp and hemp and to which it sells industrial hemp, hemp, and products derived therefrom. In addition, Criticality may avail itself of proposed legislative changes in other states to expand its product portfolio, which expansion may include business and regulatory compliance risks as yet undetermined. Failure by Criticality to comply with the current or evolving regulatory framework in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is the possibility that any such jurisdiction could determine that Criticality was not or is not compliant with applicable local regulations. If Criticality's historical or current sales or operations were found to be in violation of such regulations, it may be subject to enforcement actions in such jurisdictions including, but not limited to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations or asset seizures and the denial of regulatory applications.\nThe DEA could take action against Criticality or the CBD industry.\nThere is substantial uncertainty concerning the legal status of CBD and CBD products. The status of products, including CBD, derived from the cannabis plant under both federal and state law can depend on the THC content of the plant or derivative (including whether the plant meets the statutory definition of \u201cindustrial hemp\u201d or \u201chemp\u201d), the part of the plant from which an individual or entity produces the derivative (including whether the plant meets the statutory definition of \u201cmarihuana\u201d), whether the cultivator, processor/manufacturer, or product marketer engages in cannabis-related activities for research versus purely commercial purposes, as well as the form and intended use of the cannabis-derived product. The mere presence of CBD is not dispositive as to whether the product is legal or illegal. For example, under U.S. law, products containing CBD may be unlawful if derived from cannabis not meeting the statutory definition of \u201cindustrial hemp\u201d or \u201chemp,\u201d or if derived from industrial hemp grown outside the parameters of an approved industrial hemp pilot program or hemp cultivated in violation of the 2018 Farm Bill. Because the chemical and molecular composition of the product itself does not determine its legality, there can be no assurance that Criticality will not be subject to enforcement action, even if based on a mistaken understanding of the facts, relating to its products.\nAdditionally, before enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, the DEA had taken the position that it was not practical to produce extracts that contain more than trace amounts of CBD using parts of the plant that were excluded from the definition of marihuana. Even after enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, there can be no assurance that the DEA will treat CBD products as exempt from the Controlled Substances Act. If the DEA takes action against Criticality or the CBD industry, this could have a material adverse effect on Criticality's business, financial condition, and results of operations including the cessation of operations entirely.\nThe presence of THC in Criticality\u2019s CBD products may cause adverse consequences to users of such products that will expose it to the risk of liability and other consequences.\nCriticality\u2019s products are made from industrial hemp, which contains THC, though typically at a low level. As a result of the variability of agricultural products, certain of Criticality\u2019s products contain varying levels of THC. THC is an illegal or controlled substance in many jurisdictions. Whether or not ingestion of THC (at low levels or otherwise) is permitted in a particular jurisdiction, there may be adverse consequences to end users who test positive for THC attributed to use of Criticality\u2019s products through unintentional presence in its products of THC, even if only in trace amounts. In addition, certain metabolic processes in the body may negatively affect the results of drug tests. Positive tests may adversely affect the end user\u2019s reputation, ability to obtain or retain employment and participation in certain athletic or other activities. A claim or regulatory action against Criticality based on such positive test results could materially adversely affect its reputation, potentially expose it to material liability and potentially require it to recall its products.\nThe increasing and evolving regulation of tobacco products by the federal, state, and local governments in the United States may adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company and Purilum\u2019s nicotine-containing vaping products are subject to substantial and evolving regulation by the FDA and other federal agencies (e.g., the FTC, the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency). While each of the Company and Purilum believes that it has complied in all material respects with each currently applicable requirement by the applicable compliance date, it is possible that federal agencies may disagree and take enforcement action against the Company, Purilum or their respective nicotine-containing vaping products based on legal or factual determinations that differ from the those of the Company and Purilum, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company.\nThe FDA has proposed regulations specifically targeting the sale of flavored vapable products in the United States, which may impose additional restrictions on the Company\u2019s and Purilum\u2019s business or prevent the them from selling flavored vapable products altogether.\nIn addition, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Tobacco Control Act, requires that any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed as of the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d date of February 15, 2007, receive premarket authorization from the FDA before it can be marketed in the United States. However, the FDA announced a compliance policy for \u201cdeemed\u201d tobacco products (i.e., those products subjected to FDA regulation pursuant to the agency\u2019s 2016 \u201cdeeming\u201d regulation, including nicotine-containing vaping products) that qualify as \u201cnew tobacco products.\u201d That compliance policy allows the Company and Purilum to market such vaping products that qualify as \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d that were on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016, until August 8, 2022, and continued marketing of such products during the FDA\u2019s review of a pending marketing application submitted by August 8, 2022. In the absence of this policy, each of the Company and Purilum would have had to obtain prior authorization from FDA to market its vaping products after August 8, 2016. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s and Purilum\u2019s nicotine-containing vaping products are marketed pursuant to this compliance policy based on evidence in the Company\u2019s and Purilum\u2019s possession that they were on the U.S. market on August 8, 2016, and have not been physically modified since.\nOn March 13, 2019, the FDA issued a draft guidance document entitled \u201cModifications to Compliance Policy for Certain Deemed New Tobacco Products.\u201d The document proposes to modify the current compliance policy for certain deemed tobacco products that qualify as \u201cnew tobacco products.\u201d Relevant to vaping products, the document proposes to change the deadline for submitting\na marketing application for flavored products (other than tobacco-, mint-, and menthol-flavored products) from August 8, 2022 to August 8, 2021. The guidance document also proposes that, even during the compliance policy period, the FDA would prioritize enforcement of the premarket review requirements for such flavored products when offered for sale in ways that pose a greater risk for minors to access such products. This includes enforcement against such flavored products sold: (1) in locations that minors may enter at any time; (2) through retailers (including online retailers) that have sold to minors after the FDA finalizes the document, (3) through online retailers lacking sufficient third-party age- and identity-verification services, and (4) through online retailers with no limit on the quantity that a customer may purchase within a given time period. The guidance document also proposes that, even during the compliance policy period, the FDA similarly would enforce the premarket review requirements against all vaping products promoted to minors or marketed in a manner likely to promote use by minors. It remains unclear whether or when the FDA will issue a final version of the draft guidance document, whether the FDA will finalize the document in the form proposed, precisely how the FDA will implement the proposed policy changes, or whether, in response to potential legal challenges to any final version of the document, the FDA could implement the policies during the pendency of such litigation.\nOn May 15, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland issued a decision that may have a future impact on the FDA\u2019s compliance policy for deemed \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d on the market on the August 8, 2016, effective date of the Deeming Regulations. In response to a complaint filed by public health groups and individual physicians, the court issued an order vacating the draft guidance document described above. The court has ordered briefing on the potential remedy. The court\u2019s decision could ultimately result in the FDA\u2019s establishing a substantially earlier deadline for filing marketing applications for the Company\u2019s and Purilum\u2019s nicotine-containing vaping products than even the August 8, 2021 revised deadline proposed by the FDA in its March 13, 2019 draft guidance document. The ultimate outcome of this decision, including any appeals, remains uncertain.\nFailure to complete the required marketing applications for nicotine-containing vaping products by the ultimately required deadline, an endeavor that would be extremely time consuming and financially costly, or failure to ultimately obtain FDA marketing authorizations in response to completed and timely filed marketing applications, could prevent the Company and Purilum from marketing and selling their respective vaping products in the United States and, thus, may have a material effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company.\nState and local governments also currently regulate tobacco products, including the Company\u2019s and Purilum\u2019s nicotine-containing vaping products. Certain municipalities have enacted local ordinances that prohibit the use of e-liquid, e-cigarette and other vaping products where traditional tobacco-burning cigarettes cannot be used, and certain local jurisdictions have enacted total or partial bans on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including e-liquid, e-cigarette and other vaping products. A growing number of states have imposed excise taxes on e-liquids, e-cigarettes, and other vaping products. Other states and local jurisdictions have increased the minimum age to purchase such products to 19 or 21, have imposed restrictions or prohibitions on internet sales of such products, and have challenged the marketing of such products under consumer protection statutes (e.g., on the basis that certain marketers unlawfully target underage consumers or make unsubstantiated or misleading claims about their products). State and local regulations that prohibit or restrict the sale of vaping products in their jurisdictions, or that decrease consumer demand for these products by prohibiting their use in public places, raising the minimum age for their purchase, or raising their prices to unattractive levels via taxation, could impact the financial condition, and results of operations of the Company.\nThere may be changes in the laws, regulations and guidelines in the United States applicable to e-liquid, vapable oils, or vaping products.\nLaws, regulations, and guidelines relating to the manufacture, management, marketing and sale of e-liquids, vapable oils, and other vaping products are subject to change, including changes implemented by evolving interpretations of applicable regulatory agencies. Any changes to or the introduction of new or additional laws, regulations and guidelines, due to matters beyond the control of the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, and financial condition of these new business lines.\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations related to money laundering, financial record keeping and proceeds of crime.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), the Criminal Code (Canada), as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States and Canada. If any of the Company's investments, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions from its subsidiaries or joint ventures, or any profits or revenues accruing from such investments in the United States or Canada were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation.\nFor example, under U.S. federal law, it is unlawful to engage in financial transactions involving the proceeds of unlawful activity, including the sale of controlled substances, which in the United States includes marihuana (i.e., cannabis plants, plant parts, or derivatives that do not qualify as either hemp, the mature stalks of non-hemp plants, the sterilized seeds of non-hemp plants, or derivatives or such mature stalks or seeds). Also under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a marihuana-related business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting a violation of federal law (e.g., the Controlled Substances Act), or conspiracy (e.g., to violate the Controlled Substances Act).\nThe Company does not believe any of its activities implicate any applicable money laundering, conspiracy, or related statutes. However, if any of the Company's investments, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such investments in the United States or Canada were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation and any persons found to be aiding and abetting or conspiring to commit such violations could be subject to liability. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize the ability of FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or otherwise repatriate funds to Pyxus or any Pyxus subsidiary in the United States.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s new business lines will depend in part on attracting and retaining skilled employees.\nThe ability of the Company\u2019s new business lines to compete and grow will be dependent on having access, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, to skilled labor, including certain technical individuals and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel can be intense and the Company cannot provide assurance that the new business lines will be able to attract or retain the highly qualified personnel needed. The loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect the new business lines. The loss of any such personnel could harm or delay the plans of the new business lines either while management time is directed to finding suitable replacements (who, in any event, may not be available), or, if not, covering such vacancy until suitable replacements can be found. In either case, this may have a material adverse effect on the new business lines.\nReliance on third-party suppliers, service providers, manufacturers and distributors may result in disruption to the new business lines\u2019 supply chains.\nSuppliers, service providers and distributors to the Company\u2019s new business lines may elect, at any time, to breach or otherwise cease to participate in supply, service or distribution agreements, or other relationships, on which the operations of the new business lines rely. The loss of suppliers, service providers, manufacturers or distributors would have a material adverse effect on the business and operational results of the new business lines.\nFIGR East and FIGR Norfolk are vulnerable to rising energy costs.\nFIGR East and FIGR Norfolk operate indoor growing facilities in Canada and consume considerable energy in their operations. Accordingly, they are vulnerable to rising energy costs. Rising or volatile energy costs may have a material adverse effect on their respective business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFIGR East and FIGR Norfolk may not be able to store or transport its cannabis products to customers in a safe, timely and cost-efficient manner, and may experience breaches of security at its facilities or loss as a result of theft of its products.\nBecause of the nature of the products of FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk and the limited legal channels for distribution, as well as the concentration of inventory in their respective facilities, they are subject to a heightened risk of theft of their product and other security breaches.\nCanadian adult-use distribution rules take various forms on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and often require licensed cannabis producers to employ third parties to deliver products to central government sites. Any prolonged disruption of third-party transportation services could have a material adverse effect on sales volumes or end users\u2019 satisfaction with FIGR East\u2019s and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s products. Rising costs associated with third-party transportation services used by FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk to ship their respective products may also adversely impact profitability.\nA breach of security at any of FIGR East\u2019s and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s facilities, or during transport or delivery, could result in the significant loss of product as well as customers and may expose the FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk to additional liability, including regulatory fines, litigation or increased expenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of similar events. Any failure to take steps necessary to ensure the safekeeping of its cannabis could also have an impact on each FIGR East\u2019s and FIGR Norfolk\u2019s ability to continue operating under its existing licenses, to renew or receive amendments to its existing licenses or to receive required new licenses.\nThe future growth and profitability of the new business lines will depend on the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising and promotional expenditures.\nThe future growth and profitability of the new business lines will depend on the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising and promotional expenditures with respect to their products, including the ability to (i) create greater awareness of the products; (ii) determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for future advertising expenditures; and (iii) effectively manage\nadvertising and promotional costs in order to maintain acceptable operating margins. There can be no assurance that advertising and promotional expenditures will result in revenues in the future or will generate awareness of these products or services. In addition, the plain packaging requirements and restrictions or promotion of the Canadian cannabis regulatory regime combined with the oversight of the Criticality\u2019s operations in the United States by the FTC and FDA may limit the ability to effectively advertise and promote these products. No assurance can be given that the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and joint ventures will be able to manage their respective advertising and promotional expenditures on a cost-effective basis.\nThe results of operations and financial position of the new business lines may differ materially from the expectations of the Company's management.\nDue to numerous uncertainties, the results of operations and financial position of the new business lines may differ materially from the expectations of the Company's management. The process for estimating the revenue, net income and cash flow of the new business lines requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates and assumptions may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. In addition, the assumptions used in planning may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the financial condition or results of operations of the new business lines.\nThe Company expects to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to its investment in infrastructure, growth, regulatory compliance and operations.\nThe Company expects to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to its investment in infrastructure and growth and for regulatory compliance with respect to the new business lines, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, future changes in regulations, changes in the enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to the Company's operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company. Efforts to grow the business of the new business lines may be costlier than the Company expects, and the Company may not be able to increase its revenue enough to offset higher operating expenses. The new business lines may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events.\nThe technologies, processes, and formulations the Company uses may face competition or become obsolete.\nRapidly changing markets, technology, emerging industry standards and frequent introduction of new products characterize the Company's new business lines. The introduction of new products embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes or formulations, and the emergence of new industry standards may render the new business lines\u2019 products obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The process of developing the new business lines\u2019 products is complex and requires significant continuing costs, development efforts and third-party commitments, including from licensees, researchers, collaborators and lenders. The failure to develop new technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies or processes could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. The new business lines may be unable to anticipate changes in their respective potential customers' requirements that could make their existing technologies, processes or formulations obsolete. The success of the new business lines will depend in part on their ability to continue to enhance their existing technologies, develop new technologies that address the increasing sophistication and varied news of the market, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of the new business lines' proprietary technologies, processes and formulations entails significant technical and business risks. The new business lines may not be successful in using new technologies, exploiting niche markets effectively or adapting their respective businesses to evolving customer or medical requirements or preference or emerging industry standards.\nSome of the e-liquids, vapable oils, and vaping products produced by the new business lines contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, and the use of e-liquids, vapable oils, and other vaping products may pose a health risk to users.\nSome of the products produced by the new business lines contain nicotine, which is considered to be a highly addictive substance. Furthermore, e-liquids, vapable oils, and other vaping products may be more attractive to young individuals as a smoking alternative, perceived to be less damaging to health than traditional cigarettes. Additionally, some manufactures of e-liquids, vapable oil, and other vaping products may also use flavoring concentrates within their vaping products that contain other ingredients known to be toxic to humans. Any federal, state, or local agencies with competent authority to regulate e-liquids, vapable oil, and other vaping products in their respective jurisdictions could ban certain ingredients and/or force reformulations of certain products produced for the purposes of protecting the public's general health, which could require reformulation of products produced or sold by the new business lines. In particular, recent statements by the FDA indicate an intention to strengthen the FDA's policies against flavored e-liquids, vapable oil, and other vaping products containing tobacco-derived nicotine in order to decrease usage among young individuals. There have also been instances of vaping devices exploding during charging. Such instances can cause bodily harm and could jeopardize consumer sentiment. Any one or a combination of these considerations could have a negative impact on the new business lines' ability to effectively market and sell the e-liquids, vapable oils, and other vaping products, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA failure or deterioration in quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on the new business lines\u2019 business and operating results.\nThe quality and safety of the products of the new business lines are critical to the success of their respective businesses. As such, it is imperative that their (and their service providers\u2019) respective quality control systems operate effectively and successfully. Quality control systems can be negatively impacted by, among other things, poor design, inadequate training and failure of employees to adhere to strict quality control guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of the quality control systems of a new business line could have a material adverse effect on its business and operating results.\nEach of the new business lines faces inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if its products are alleged to have caused significant loss, injury or death, which is exacerbated by the fact that cannabis use may increase the risk of serious adverse side effects.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products which are ingested or otherwise consumed by humans, each of the new business lines faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if its products are alleged to have caused loss, injury or death. Each of the new business lines may be subject to these types of claims due to allegations that its products caused or contributed to injury, illness or death, made false, misleading or impermissible claims, failed to include adequate labelling and instructions for use or failed to include adequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. This risk is exacerbated for FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk by the fact that cannabis use may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses, symptoms for individuals with bipolar disorder, and other side effects. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of cannabis products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could also occur. In addition, the manufacture and sale of cannabis products, like the manufacture and sale of any ingested or consumable product, involves a risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Any of the new business lines may in the future have to recall certain of its products as a result of potential contamination and quality assurance concerns. A product liability claim or regulatory action against any of the new business lines could result in increased costs and could adversely affect its reputation and goodwill with its consumers. There can be no assurance that product liability insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could result in the Company becoming subject to significant liabilities that are uninsured and also could adversely affect commercial arrangements between the new business lines and third parties.\nThe Company could incur substantial liability that may not be covered by insurance.\nThe Company has insurance to protect its assets, operations and employees. While the Company believes its insurance coverage addresses all material risks to which it is exposed and is adequate and customary in its current state of operations, such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for the risks and hazards to which the Company is exposed. In addition, no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover the Company's liabilities or will be generally available in the future or, if available, that premiums will be commercially justifiable. If the Company were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if the Company were to incur such liability at a time when it is not able to obtain liability insurance, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn particular, due to the Company's involvement in the cannabis and hemp industries, it may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate its business, which may expose the Company to additional risk and financial liability. Insurance that is otherwise readily available, such as general liability, and directors and officer's insurance, may be more difficult to find, and more expensive, because of the regulatory regime applicable to the industry. There are no guarantees that the Company will be able to find such insurance coverage in the future, or that the cost will be affordable. If the Company is forced to go without such insurance coverage, it may prevent it from entering into certain business sectors, may inhibit growth, and may expose the Company to additional risk and financial liabilities.\nIf the Company is unable to obtain appropriate crop insurance at acceptable rates or at all, the Company may have excessive exposure in the event of crop failure.\nThe availability of crop insurance for the Canadian cannabis industry and the U.S. hemp industry is limited. The Company, including FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East, may not be able to obtain crop insurance with respect to cannabis and hemp at economically feasible rates, on acceptable terms or at all. As a result, we may have limited or no recourse in the event of a failed crop or other event against which standard crop insurance would typically insure. Such inability may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe Company could incur unexpected expenses due to product recalls and any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with the recall.\nManufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of the Company's products are recalled due to an alleged product\ndefect or for any other reason, the Company could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. The Company may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant attention from management. Although the Company has detailed procedures in place for testing its products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of the products produced by the Company were subject to recall, the image and reputation of that product and the Company as a whole could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for the Company's products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and reputation of the Company.\nAdditionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of the Company's operations by applicable regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.\nThe Company may be unable to obtain or maintain the farmland necessary to support operations of the new business lines.\nThe Company may not be able to maintain or obtain high quality farmland in sufficient acreage to support production levels or sustained accelerated growth of the new business lines. Moreover, where farmland is available in sufficient acreage, it may not be available at rental rates or otherwise on acceptable economic terms. Inability to obtain sufficient farmland for the operations of the new business lines (with or without significant product demand growth) could negatively affect the Company's operations and financial condition.\nCertain of the new business lines involve growing agricultural products, which is subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, including but not limited to unusual or extreme weather patterns.\nThe growing of cannabis and industrial hemp, each of which is an agricultural product, is subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, such as insects, plant diseases and similar agricultural risks. Although cannabis growing is currently anticipated to be completed indoors under climate-controlled conditions, there can be no assurance that natural elements will not have a material adverse effect on the production of the Company's cannabis products.\nFurther, the Company's business is dependent on the outdoor growth and production of hemp products to be purchased by the Company for supply to Criticality. As such, the risks inherent in engaging in outdoor agricultural businesses apply. Agricultural production by its nature contains elements of risk and uncertainty that may adversely affect the business and operations of the Company, including but not limited to the following: (i) any future climate change with a potential shift in weather patterns leading to droughts and associated crop losses; (ii) potential insect, fungal and weed infestations resulting in crop failure and reduced yields; (iii) wild and domestic animals damaging the crops; and (iv) crop-raiding, sabotage or vandalism. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to achieve its production targets for industrial hemp. The Company's ability to obtain adequate (or any) insurance relating to the foregoing risks may be limited.\nThere can be no guarantee that an agricultural event will not adversely affect the Company's business and operating results.\nHemp plants are vulnerable to specific agricultural risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company's hemp-related operations.\nHemp plants can be vulnerable to various pathogens including bacteria, fungi, viruses and other miscellaneous pathogens. Such instances often lead to reduced crop quality, stunted growth and/or death of the plant. Moreover, hemp is phytoremediative meaning that it may extract toxins or other undesirable chemicals or compounds from the ground in which it is planted. Various regulatory agencies have established maximum limits for pathogens, toxins, chemicals and other compounds that may be present in agricultural materials. If the hemp acquired by the Company for supply to Criticality is found to have levels of pathogens, toxins, chemicals, or other undesirable compounds that exceed established limits, the Company may have to destroy the applicable portions of its hemp crop. Should the crops be lost due to pathogens, toxins, chemicals or other undesirable compounds, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition.\nFIGR East and FIGR Norfolk may not successfully execute their production capacity expansion strategies.\nFIGR East is currently in the process of the Charlottetown and FIGR Norfolk has developed plans for the FIGR Norfolk Expansion. These expansion projects are subject to applicable regulatory approvals and may experience construction delays or cost over-runs. In addition, FIGR Norfolk has not yet secured financing necessary to fund the FIGR Norfolk Expansion, and may not be able to secure funding on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, the FIGR Norfolk Expansion is planned to be completed in phases, each of which is susceptible to further delays and cost over-runs.\nIf either FIGR East and FIGR Norfolk is unable to complete its expansion projects as planned, or is unable to secure necessary production licenses in respect of its facilities, or secure necessary financing, the expectations of management with respect to the increased future cultivation and growing capacity may not be realized, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company's cannabis production estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate.\nThe Company's estimated future annual production of cannabis is based on estimated square footage of cultivation space and the amount of dried cannabis cultivated per plant, which is derived from the historical output of the existing facilities of FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East. If FIGR Norfolk and FIGR East are unable to develop the predicted cultivation space, cultivate the predicted amount of cannabis or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, annual cannabis production may be less than predicted, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe new business lines may be unable to renew or maintain its leases.\nThe new business lines may be unable to renew or maintain its leases (commercial, real property or farmland) on commercially acceptable terms or at all. An inability to renew leases, or a renewal of leases with a rental rate higher than the prevailing rate under the applicable lease prior to expiration, may have an adverse impact on the operations of the new business lines, including disruption of operations or an increase in the cost of operations. In addition, in the event of non-renewal of any of the leases, the new business lines may be unable to locate suitable replacement properties for their facilities or they may experience delays in relocation that could lead to a disruption in their operations. Any disruption in the new business lines' operations could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe new business lines are heavily dependent on their respective intellectual property and trade secrets. If they are unable to effectively defend their respective intellectual property and trade secrets, their respective image, brand or competitive position may be harmed.\nThe success of the new business lines is heavily dependent upon their respective intangible property and technology. The Company relies upon copyrights, patents, trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to protect important intangible property, technology and information. The Company relies on various methods to protect its proprietary rights, including confidentiality agreements with consultants, service providers and management that contain terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized use and disclosure of confidential information. However, despite efforts to protect intangible property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or replicate intangible property, technology or processes. There can be no assurances that the steps taken by the Company to protect its intangible property, technology and information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or independent third-party development of the Company's intangible property, technology or processes. It is likely that other companies can duplicate a production process similar to the Company's. Other companies may also be able to materially duplicate the Company's proprietary plant strains.\nWith respect to any intangible property rights claim against the Company, the Company may have to pay damages or stop using intangible property found to be in violation of a third party's rights. The Company may have to seek a license for the intangible property, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase operating expenses. The technology also may not be available for license at all. As a result, the Company may also be required to pursue alternative options, which could require significant effort and expense. If the Company cannot license or obtain an alternative for the infringing aspects of its business, it may be forced to limit product offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm the Company's brand and prevent it from generating sufficient revenue or achieving profitability.\nTo the extent that any of the above occur, revenue could be negatively affected, and in the future, the Company may have to litigate to enforce its intangible property rights, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and other resources.\nEach of the new business lines\u2019 ability to successfully implement its business plan depends in part on its ability to obtain, maintain and build brand recognition using its trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names and other intellectual property rights. If their efforts to protect their intellectual property are unsuccessful or inadequate, or if any third-party misappropriates or infringes on their intellectual property, the value of its brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on their business and might prevent the brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.\nThe new business lines may be unable to obtain registrations for its intellectual property rights for various reasons, including refusal by regulatory authorities to register trademarks or other intellectual property protections, prior registrations of which it is not aware, or it may encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where it operates or intends to conduct operations. This could harm its image, brand or competitive position and cause the new business lines to incur significant penalties and costs.\nThe success of each of the new business lines depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of its scientific and technical personnel, consultants and advisors, as well as contractors. Because the Company operates in a highly competitive industry, it relies in part on trade secrets to protect its proprietary products and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. The Company enters into confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements with its corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, developers and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the receiving party keep confidential, and not disclose to third parties, confidential information developed by the receiving party or made known to the receiving party by the Company during the course of the receiving party's relationship with the Company. These agreements also\ngenerally provide that inventions conceived by the receiving party in the course of rendering services to the Company will be its exclusive property, and the Company enters into assignment agreements to perfect its rights. These confidentiality, inventions and assignment agreements, where in place, may be breached and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to the Company. The Company's trade secrets also could be independently discovered by competitors, in which case the Company would not be able to prevent the use of such trade secrets by its competitors. The enforcement of a claim alleging that a party illegally obtained and was using the Company's trade secrets could be difficult, expensive and time consuming and the outcome could be unpredictable. The failure to obtain or maintain meaningful trade secret protection could adversely affect the Company's competitive position.\nRisks Relating to Other Aspects of Our Operations\nLow investment performance by our defined benefit pension plan assets may increase our pension expense, and may require us to fund a larger portion of our pension obligations, thus, diverting funds from other potential uses.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible employees. Our pension expense and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nIf plan assets perform below the assumed rate of return used to determine pension expense, future pension expense will increase. Further, as a result of the global economic instability or other economic market events, our pension plan investment portfolio may experience significant volatility.\nThe proportion of pension assets to liabilities, which is called the funded status, determines the level of contribution to the plan that is required by law. In recent years, we have funded the plan in amounts as required, but changes in the plan\u2019s funded status related to the value of assets or liabilities could increase the amount required to be funded. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our pension funding obligations, diverting funds that would otherwise be available for other uses.\nWe rely on internal and externally hosted information technology systems and disruption, failure or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology (IT) systems, including systems hosted by service providers. The enterprise resource planning system (SAP) we have implemented throughout the Company, for example, is hosted by Capgemini and our domestic employee payroll system is hosted by Ceridian. Although we have disaster recovery plans and several intrusion preventive mitigating tools and services in place, which are active inline services or are tested routinely, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems, including those hosted by service providers, may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses or other malicious software programs and cyber-attacks, including system hacking and other cyber-security breaches. For example, in April 2019, the Company discovered that the email accounts of two Canadian employees had been compromised resulting in the unauthorized access of customer and vendor data. These incidents were neither material nor compromised the Company\u2019s other IT systems. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation, and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nWe believe that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at March 31, 2019 as reported elsewhere in this Annual Report. Although we intend to continue to aggressively monitor and improve our internal controls, we cannot assure you that other material weaknesses will not occur in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material. Ineffective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock and could also require additional restatements of our prior reported financial information.\nRegulations regarding environmental matters may affect the Company by substantially increasing the Company's costs and exposing it to potential liability.\nThe Company is subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. Such regulations govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and the health and safety of the Company's employees. For example, the Company's products and the raw materials used in its production processes are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. The Company may be required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of its current or proposed operations. The Company may not have been, nor may it be able to be at all times, in full compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, the Company could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nAs with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, the Company faces inherent risks of environmental liability at its current and historical production sites. Certain environmental laws impose strict and, in certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of the investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. In addition, the Company may discover new facts or conditions that may change its expectations or be faced with changes in environmental laws or their enforcement that would increase its liabilities. Furthermore, its costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, or the Company's liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, regulated materials, may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Global Financial and Credit Markets\nVolatility and disruption of global financial and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access financing and expose us to unexpected risks.\nGlobal financial and credit markets expose us to a variety of risks as we fund our business with a combination of cash from operations, short-term seasonal credit lines, the ABL Facility, long-term debt securities and customer advances. We have financed our non-U.S. operations with uncommitted unsecured short-term seasonal lines of credit at the local level. These local operating lines typically extend for a term of up to one year and are typically uncommitted in that the lenders have the right to cease making loans and demand repayment of loans at any time. As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $429.0 million drawn and outstanding on short-term foreign seasonal lines and a maximum borrowing capacity under these lines and the ABL Facility totaling $855.9 million, subject to limitations under the ABL Facility. Changes in the global financial and credit markets could create uncertainty as to whether local seasonal lines will continue to be available to finance our non-U.S. operations to the extent or on terms similar to what has been available in the past and whether repayment of existing loans under these lines will be demanded prior to maturity.\nTo the extent that local seasonal lines cease to be available at levels necessary to finance our non-U.S. operations or we are required to repay loans under the lines prior to maturity, we may be required to seek alternative financing sources beyond our existing committed sources of funding. Based on the current financial and credit markets, we cannot assure you that such alternative funding will be available to us on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or at all. In the event that we may be required to support our non-U.S. operations by borrowing U.S. dollars under the ABL Facility, we may be exposed to additional currency exchange risk that we may be unable to successfully hedge. Further, there is additional risk that certain banks that are lenders under seasonal lines could be unable to meet contractually obligated borrowing requests in the future if their financial condition were to deteriorate. In addition, we maintain deposit accounts with numerous financial institutions around the world in amounts that exceed applicable governmental deposit insurance levels. While we actively monitor our deposit relationships, we are subject to risk of loss in the event of the unanticipated failure of a financial institution in which we maintain deposits, which loss could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nDerivative transactions may expose us to potential losses and counterparty risk.\nWe may, from time to time, enter into certain derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges are reported as income, and accordingly could materially affect our reported income in any period. In addition, the counterparties to these derivative transactions may be financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we would be subject to risks that these counterparties default under these transactions. In some of these transactions, our exposure to counterparty credit risk may not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions over the last few years have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including bankruptcy. If one or more of the counterparties to one or more of our derivative transactions not secured by any collateral becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we would become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties.\nRisks Relating to the Tobacco Industry\nReductions in demand for consumer tobacco products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe tobacco industry, both in the United States and abroad, continues to face a number of issues that may reduce the consumption of cigarettes and adversely affect our business, sales volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThese issues, some of which are more fully discussed below, include:\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions seeking to ascribe to tobacco product manufacturers liability for adverse health effects associated with smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke;\n\u2022\nsmoking and health litigation against tobacco product manufacturers;\n\u2022\nincreased consumer acceptance of electronic cigarettes;\n\u2022\ntax increases on consumer tobacco products;\ncurrent and potential actions by state attorneys general to enforce the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement, or MSA, between state governments in the United States and tobacco product manufacturers;\n\u2022\ngovernmental and private bans and restrictions on smoking;\n\u2022\nactual and proposed price controls and restrictions on imports in certain jurisdictions outside the United States;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on tobacco product manufacturing, marketing, advertising and sales;\n\u2022\nthe diminishing social acceptance of smoking;\n\u2022\nincreased pressure from anti-smoking groups;\n\u2022\nother tobacco product legislation that may be considered by Congress, the states, municipalities and other countries; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of consolidation among multinational cigarette manufacturers.\nTobacco product manufacturer litigation may reduce demand for our products and services.\nOur primary customers, the leading cigarette manufacturers, have faced thousands of lawsuits brought throughout the United States and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world. These lawsuits have been brought by different types of plaintiffs, including: (1) individuals and classes of individuals alleging personal injury and/or misleading advertising; (2) governments (including governmental and quasi-governmental entities in the United States and abroad) seeking recovery of health care costs allegedly caused by cigarette smoking; and (3) other groups seeking recovery of health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking, including third-party health care payors, such as unions and health maintenance organizations. Damages claimed in some of the smoking and health cases have ranged into the billions of dollars. There have been many jury verdicts for plaintiffs in tobacco product litigation over the past several years. Additional plaintiffs continue to file lawsuits. The effects of the previous and current lawsuits on our customers could reduce their demand for tobacco from us.\nLegislation and regulatory and other governmental initiatives could impose burdensome restrictions on the tobacco industry and reduce consumption of consumer tobacco products and demand for our services.\nThe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which amended the FDCA, extends the authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco products. This act authorizes the FDA to adopt product standards for tobacco products, including the level of nicotine yield and the reduction or elimination of other constituents of the products, along with provisions for the testing of products against these standards. The act imposes further restrictions on advertising of tobacco products, authorizes the FDA to limit the sales of tobacco products to face-to-face transactions permitting the verification of the age of the purchaser, authorizes a study to determine whether the minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products should be increased and requires submission of reports from manufacturers of tobacco products to the FDA regarding product ingredients and other matters, including reports on health, toxicological, behavioral, or physiologic effects of tobacco products and their constituents. The act also mandates warning labels and requires packaging to indicate the percentage of domestically grown tobacco and foreign grown tobacco included in the product. The FDA has adopted regulations under the act establishing requirements for the sale, distribution and marketing of cigarettes, as well as package warnings and advertising limitations.\nThe act directs the FDA to promulgate regulations requiring that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, preproduction design validation, packing, and storage of a tobacco product conform to current good manufacturing practice. Regulations under the act do not apply to tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of a manufacturer of tobacco products, or to the producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco suppliers, tobacco warehouses, and tobacco supplier cooperatives unless those entities are controlled by a tobacco product manufacturer, but do apply to our U.S. cut rag processing facility with respect to covered tobacco products.\nIn May 2016, the FDA finalized regulations, which became effective in August 2016, that extend its regulatory authority under the act to tobacco products not previously covered by its regulations, including vaporizers, vape pens, hookah pens, electronic cigarettes (or, e-cigarettes), e-pipes, and other types of electronic nicotine delivery systems, including e-liquids used in these devices, as well as pipe tobacco and cigars (including little cigars and cigarillos), and future novel tobacco products. These regulations require manufacturers of these additional tobacco products to, among other things submit an application and obtain FDA authorization to market a new tobacco product (as noted above); register establishment(s) and submit product listing to FDA; submit listing of ingredients; submit information on harmful and potentially harmful constituents; submit tobacco health documents; not introduce into interstate commerce modified-risk tobacco products (e.g., products with label, labeling, or advertising representing that they reduce risk or are less harmful compared to other tobacco products on the market) without an FDA order; and include the required warning statement on packaging and advertisements. These regulations will extend to certain of our operations that had not previously been subject to the act, including the processing of pipe tobacco and tobacco for little cigars and cigarillos at our U.S. cut rag processing facility, and to joint ventures and subsidiaries that develop, produce and sell consumable e-liquids. In addition, the May 2016 regulations make these additional tobacco products subject to certain existing restrictions on the sale of cigarettes, including restrictions prohibiting sale to individuals under 18 years of age. In addition, recently federal legislators have proposed bills that would establish a national minimum purchase age of 21 for tobacco and tobacco-based products, including e-liquids.\nThe full impact of the act, including the May 2016 regulations and any future regulatory action to implement the act, is uncertain. However, if the effect of the act and FDA regulations under the act is a significant reduction in consumption of tobacco products, it could materially adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nReports with respect to the harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years, and the sale, promotion and use of cigarettes continue to be subject to increasing governmental regulation. Since 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have released a number of reports linking cigarette smoking with a broad range of health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic lung disease, and recommending various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. More recent reports focus upon the addictive nature of cigarettes, the effects of smoking cessation, the decrease in smoking in the United States, the economic and regulatory aspects of smoking in the Western Hemisphere, and cigarette smoking by adolescents, particularly the addictive nature of cigarette smoking in adolescence. Numerous state and municipal governments have taken and others may take actions to diminish the social acceptance of smoking of tobacco products, including banning smoking in certain public and private locations.\nA number of foreign nations also have taken steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion, to increase taxes on cigarettes and to discourage cigarette smoking. In some cases, such restrictions are more onerous than those in the United States. For example, advertising and promotion of cigarettes has been banned or severely restricted for a number of years in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Singapore and other countries. Further, in February 2005, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) treaty, the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (\u201cFCTC\u201d), entered into force. This treaty, which is binding on 181 nations as of March 31, 2019, requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would require, among other things, specific actions to prevent youth smoking; restrict or prohibit tobacco product marketing; inform the public about the health consequences of smoking and the benefits of quitting; regulate the content of tobacco products; impose new package warning requirements including the use of pictorial or graphic images; eliminate cigarette smuggling and counterfeit cigarettes; restrict smoking in public places; increase and harmonize cigarette excise taxes; abolish duty-free tobacco sales; and permit and encourage litigation against tobacco product manufacturers.\nDue to the present regulatory and legislative environment, a substantial risk exists that past growth trends in tobacco product sales may not continue and that existing sales may decline. A significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for tobacco products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGovernment actions can have a significant effect on the sourcing of tobacco. If some of the current efforts are successful, we could have difficulty obtaining sufficient tobacco to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nThe WHO, through the FCTC, created a formal study group to identify and assess crop diversification initiatives and alternatives to leaf tobacco growing in countries whose economies depend upon tobacco production. The study group began its work in February 2007. In its initial report published later that year, the study group indicated that the FCTC did not aim to phase out tobacco growing, but the study group's focus on alternatives to tobacco crops was in preparation for its anticipated eventual decrease in demand resulting from the FCTC's other tobacco control initiatives.\nIf the objective of the FCTC study group were to change to seek to eliminate or significantly reduce leaf tobacco production and certain countries were to partner with the study group in pursuing this objective, we could encounter difficulty in sourcing leaf tobacco to fill customer requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues, including climate change, conservation, and natural resource management, could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight of industry activities, which may lead to increased levels of expenditures for environmental controls, land use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers, and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, certain aspects of our business generate carbon emissions. Regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions have been proposed in certain countries in which we operate. These may include limitations on such emissions, taxes or emission allowance fees on such emissions, various restrictions on industrial operations, and other measures that could affect land-use decisions, the cost of agricultural production, and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products. These actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been, and continue to be, subject to governmental investigations into, and litigation concerning, leaf tobacco industry buying and other payment practices.\nThe leaf tobacco industry, from time to time, has been the subject of government investigations regarding trade practices. For example, we were the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice into certain\nbuying practices alleged to have occurred in the industry, we were named defendants in an antitrust class action litigation alleging a conspiracy to rig bids in the tobacco auction markets, and we were the subject of an administrative investigation into certain\ntobacco buying and selling practices alleged to have occurred within the leaf tobacco industry in some countries within the European Union, including Spain, Italy, Greece and potentially other countries.", "PERMNO": 29867, "SIC": 5190, "TIC": "PYXSQ"}
