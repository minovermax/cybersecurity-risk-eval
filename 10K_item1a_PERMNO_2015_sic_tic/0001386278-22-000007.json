Risk Factors\nCOVID-19 RISKS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to significantly affect how we and our retail distributors are operating our businesses.\nOur operations have and may continue to be negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control. Specifically, we have shifted to a remote workforce strategy for our employees in the U.S. and we have closed most of our leased office locations in the U.S., which resulted in us recording impairment charges in 2020 and could result in a less effective workforce. In addition, many of the third-party call centers we rely on to provide customer support experienced periodic disruptions in 2021 due to the pandemic, which resulted in delayed responses to customers and a higher usage of automated services, and contributed to higher transaction losses compared to prior periods. While such staffing issues have been resolved, it is possible that we may continue to experience similar issues in the future due to the pandemic. The business and operations of our retail distributors and our BaaS and other partners were likewise disrupted, with many having experienced reduced foot traffic or usage of their services. We have experienced and may continue to experience increased costs, including higher call center costs and disputed transaction losses, which could continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods. Further, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets, which may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to access capital markets in the future.\nDespite widespread vaccination efforts in the United States, COVID-19 could still have an adverse impact on our customers and their clients as the duration and magnitude of the continuing effects of COVID-19 remain uncertain and dependent on various factors, including the continued severity and transmission rate of the virus and new variants of the virus like the Delta and Omicron variants, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against such variants, the nature of and duration for which the preventative measures remain in place, the extent and effectiveness of containment and mitigation efforts, including vaccination programs and mandates, the type of stimulus measures and other policy responses that the U.S. government or regulators may further adopt, if any, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, retail distributors, partners and vendors. Governmental actions such as the American Rescue Plan of 2021 have helped mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on our business in 2021, which provided an economic stimulus package totaling $1.9 trillion, and offered additional direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits which expired in September 2021 and monthly child tax credit payments which expired in December 2021.\nWe have taken steps to strengthen our liquidity position and ensure we have ample flexibility to pursue strategic priorities. Should we require credit at levels we are unable to access, the cost of credit is greater than expected, or the cost-savings measures we have implemented are ineffective or result in us incurring greater costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. Further, additional borrowings on our revolving line of credit have and will cause us to incur additional interest expense, which will negatively affect our earnings.\nPlease see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations\u201d for more information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe loss of operating revenues from Walmart or any of our largest retail distributors as well as our significant BaaS partners, third-party processors or other major consumers would adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our operating revenues are derived from the products and services sold at our largest retail distributors. As a percentage of total operating revenues, operating revenues derived from products and services sold at the store locations of Walmart was approximately 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect that Walmart will continue to have a significant impact on our operating revenues in future periods, particularly in our Consumer Services segment. It would be difficult to replace Walmart and the operating revenues derived from products and services sold at their stores. Accordingly, the loss of Walmart or any significant decrease in customers\u2019 spending levels and ability or willingness to purchase our account products through Walmart, for any reason, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our large retail distributors, significant BaaS partners, third-party processors or other major consumers could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain consumers, BaaS partners, third-party processors and other retail distributors, and could lessen our negotiating power with our remaining and prospective retail distributors, BaaS partners, third-party processors and consumers.\nThe term of our Walmart Money Card agreement (which governs the MoneyCard program) expires on January 31, 2027, unless renewed under its automatic renewal provision, which provides for a one-year extension. Our contracts with Walmart and our other largest retail distributors can in limited circumstances, such as our material breach or insolvency or, in the case of Walmart, our failure to meet agreed-upon service levels, certain changes in control, and our inability or unwillingness to agree to requested pricing changes, be terminated by these retail distributors on relatively short notice. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our relationships with our largest retail distributors, significant BaaS partners, third-party processors or consumers on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that our relationships will continue beyond the terms of our existing contracts with them. Our operating revenues and results of operations could suffer if, among other things, any of our retail distributors, significant BaaS partners, third-party processors or consumers renegotiates, terminates or fails to renew, or to renew on similar or favorable terms, its agreement with us or otherwise chooses to modify the level of support it provides for our products.\nOur base of tax preparation partners is concentrated, and the performance of our Money Movement Services segment depends in part on our ability to retain existing partners.\nIf one or more of our major tax preparation partners were to substantially reduce or stop offering our services to their customers, our tax refund processing services business, a component of our Money Movement Services segment, would be harmed. Substantially all the revenues we generate from our tax refund processing services business have come from sales through a relatively small number of tax preparation firms. We do not have long-term contractual commitments from most of our current tax preparation partners and our tax preparation partners may elect to not renew their contracts with us with little or no advance notice. As a result, we cannot be assured that any of our current tax preparation partners will continue to partner with us past the terms in their current agreements. A termination of our relationships with certain tax preparation partners that provide commercial tax preparation software would result in lost revenue and the loss of the ability to secure future relationships with new or existing tax preparation firms that use such tax software.\nOur future success depends upon the active and effective promotion of our products and services by retail distributors and tax preparation partners.\nMost of our operating revenues are derived from our products and services sold at the stores of our retail distributors. In addition, the revenues we generate from our tax refund processing services are largely derived from products and services sold through retail tax preparation businesses and income tax software providers. Revenues from our retail distributors and tax preparation partners depend on a number of factors outside our control and may vary from period to period. Because we compete with many other providers of products and services for placement and promotion of products in the stores of our retail distributors or in conjunction with the delivery of tax preparation services by our tax preparation providers, our success depends on the willingness of our retail distributors and tax preparation partners to promote our products and services successfully. In general, our contracts with these third parties allow them to exercise significant discretion over the placement and promotion of our products and services, and they could give higher priority to the products and services of other companies for a variety of reasons. Accordingly, losing the support of our retail distributors and tax preparation partners might limit or reduce the sales of our products and services. Our operating revenues and operating expenses may also be negatively affected by the operational decisions of our retail distributors and tax preparation partners. For example, if a retail distributor reduces shelf space for our products or implements changes in its systems that disrupt the integration between its systems and ours, our product sales could be reduced or decline, and we may incur additional merchandising costs to ensure our products are appropriately stocked. Similarly, for a variety of reasons, many of our tax preparation partners that provide commercial income tax preparation software offer their customers several alternatives for tax refund processing services, including those of our competitors. Even if our retail distributors and tax preparation partners actively and effectively promote our products and services, there can be no assurance that their efforts will maintain or result in growth of our operating revenues.\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not be successful.\nOur prospects for growth depend on our ability to innovate by offering new, and adding value to our existing, product and service offerings and on our ability to effectively commercialize such innovations. For example, in January 2021, we launched GO2bank, a new mobile bank account aimed at serving the low-and moderate-income market. We will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. If customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services, which would negatively impact our operating revenues. We may not achieve significant operating revenues from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and services may not be as high as the margins we have experienced in the past.\nFuture revenue growth depends on our ability to retain and attract new long-term users of our products.\nOur ability to increase account usage and account holder retention and to attract new long-term users of our products can have a significant impact on our operating revenues. We may be unable to generate increases in account usage, account holder retention or attract new long-term users of our products for a number of reasons, including if we are unable to maintain our existing distribution channels, predict accurately consumer preferences or industry changes and modify our products and services on a timely basis in response thereto, produce new features and services that appeal to existing and prospective customers, and influence account holder behavior through cardholder retention and usage incentives. Our results of operations could vary materially from period to period based on the degree to which we are successful in increasing usage and retention and attracting long-term users of our products.\nSeasonal fluctuations in the use of our products and services impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations and cash flows vary from quarter to quarter, and periodically decline, due to the seasonal nature of the use of our products and services. For example, our results of operations for the first half of each year have been favorably affected by large numbers of taxpayers electing to receive their tax refunds via direct deposit on our accounts, which caused our operating revenues to be typically higher in the first half of those years than they were in the corresponding second half of those years. Our tax refund processing services business is also highly seasonal as it generates the substantial majority of its revenue in the first quarter, and substantially all of its revenue in the first half of each calendar year. To the extent that seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, or are not offset by other factors, our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities could fluctuate materially from period to period.\nThe industries in which we compete are highly competitive.\nThe industries in which we compete are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant changes. We compete against companies and financial institutions across the retail banking, financial services, transaction processing, consumer technology and financial technology services industries, and may compete with others in the market who may in the future provide offerings similar to ours, particularly vendors who provide program management and other services though a platform similar to our banking platform. These and other competitors in the banking and electronic payments industries are introducing innovative products and services that may compete with ours. We expect that this competition will continue as banking and electronic payments industries continue to evolve, particularly if non-traditional payments processors and other parties gain greater market share in these industries. If we are unable to differentiate our products and platform from and/or successfully compete with those of our competitors, our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business could be materially and adversely affected.\nMany existing and potential competitors are entities substantially larger in size, more highly diversified in revenue and substantially more established with significantly more broadly known brand awareness than ours. As such, many of our competitors can leverage their size, robust networks, financial wherewithal, brand awareness, pricing power and technological assets to compete with us. Additionally, some of our current and potential competitors are subject to fewer regulations and restrictions than we are, and thus may be able to respond more quickly in the face of regulatory and technological changes.\nWe are also experiencing increased competition as a result of new entrants offering free or low-cost alternatives to our products and services. In recent years, \u201cchallenger\u201d banks have gained market share through the marketing of their largely free bank account offerings. To the extent these new entrants continue to take market share at our expense, we expect that the purchase and use of our products and services would decline. In response to such challenger banks, we launched GO2bank, a new mobile bank account aimed at serving the low-and moderate-income market with tools that help address common financial challenges and opportunities to improve long-term financial health. If GO2bank is not successful or our competitive position deteriorates further, we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our retail distributors and our tax preparation partners, or directly to consumers, and decrease the prices of our products and services, any of which would likely adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry and the larger electronic payments industry.\nThe electronic payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third parties for the development of, and access to, new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to our industry will continue\nto emerge, and these new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently utilize in our products and services. Additionally, we may make future investments in, or enter into strategic alliances to develop, new technologies and services or to implement infrastructure change to further our strategic objectives, strengthen our existing businesses and remain competitive. However, our ability to transition to new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a lack of industry-wide standards, by resistance from our retail distributors, BaaS partners, third-party processors or consumers to these changes, or by the intellectual property rights of third parties. These initiatives are inherently risky, and they may not be successful or may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFraudulent and other illegal activity involving our products and services could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nCriminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities using deposit account products (including prepaid cards), reload products, or customer information. Illegal activities involving our products and services often include malicious social engineering schemes. Further, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been and may continue to be a significant amount of transaction fraud with respect to prepaid cards used to deliver stimulus and unemployment benefits, which has negatively impacted many financial services companies.\nIllegal activities may also include fraudulent payment or refund schemes and identity theft. We rely upon third parties for transaction processing services, which subjects us and our customers to risks related to the vulnerabilities of those third parties. A single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, involving our cards and other products and services, have in the past and could in the future, result in reputational damage to us. Such damage could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services, cause retail distributors to cease doing business with us, or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs. Fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions, including significant monetary fines, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo address the challenges that we face with respect to fraudulent activity, we have implemented risk control mechanisms that have made it more difficult for all customers, including legitimate customers, to obtain and use our products and services. We believe it is likely that our risk control mechanisms may continue to adversely affect our new card activations for the foreseeable future and that our operating revenues will be negatively impacted as a result. Further, implementing such risk control mechanisms can be costly and has and may continue to negatively impact our operating margins.\nWe are exposed to losses from customer accounts.\nFraudulent activity involving our products may lead to customer disputed transactions, for which we may be liable under banking regulations and payment network rules. Our fraud detection and risk control mechanisms may not prevent all fraudulent or illegal activity. To the extent we incur losses from disputed transactions, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, our cardholders can incur charges in excess of the funds available in their accounts, and we may become liable for these overdrafts. For cardholders who are not enrolled or do not meet the eligibility requirements of our overdraft protection program, we generally decline authorization attempts for amounts that exceed the available balance in a cardholder\u2019s account, however, the application of card association rules, the timing of the settlement of transactions and the assessment of the card\u2019s monthly maintenance fee, among other things, can still result in overdrawn accounts. Our overdraft exposure in these instances arises primarily from late-posting. A late-post occurs when a merchant posts a transaction within a payment network-permitted time frame, but subsequent to our release of the authorization for that transaction, as permitted by card association rules. Under card association rules, we may be liable for the transaction amount even if the cardholder has made additional purchases in the intervening period and funds are no longer available on the card at the time the transaction is posted.\nAdditionally, beginning in 2021, we introduced an optional overdraft protection program service on certain demand deposit account programs that allows eligible cardholders who opt-in to spend up to a pre-authorized amount in excess of their available card balance.\nWe maintain reserves to cover the risk that we may not recover these amounts due from our cardholders, but our exposure may increase above these reserves for a variety of reasons, including our failure to predict the actual recovery rate accurately. To the extent we incur losses from overdrafts above our reserves or we determine that it is necessary to increase our reserves substantially, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face settlement risks from our distributors and banking partners, which may increase during an economic recession.\nA large portion of our business is conducted through retail distributors that sell our products and services to consumers at their store locations or other partners that collect funds and fees from our customers on our behalf. Our retail distributors and partners collect funds from the consumers who purchase our products and services and then must remit these funds directly to our subsidiary bank. The remittance of these funds by the retail distributor or partner takes on average two business days. If a retail distributor or partner becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits fraud or otherwise fails to remit proceeds to our card issuing bank from the sales of our products and services, we are liable for any amounts owed to our customers. As of December 31, 2021, we had assets subject to settlement risk of $320.4 million. Given the possibility of recurring volatility in global financial markets, the approaches we use to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of our retail distributors may be inadequate, and we may be unable to detect and take steps to mitigate an increased credit risk in a timely manner. Economic recessions could result in settlement losses, whether or not directly related to our business. We are not insured against these risks. Significant settlement losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic, political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending.\nThe electronic payments industry, including the prepaid financial services segment within that industry, depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer spending. An economic recession may result in us experiencing a reduction in the number of our accounts that are purchased or reloaded, the number of transactions involving our cards and the use of our reload network and related services. A sustained reduction in the use of our products and related services, either as a result of a general reduction in consumer spending or as a result of a disproportionate reduction in the use of card-based payment systems, would materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must be able to operate and scale our technology effectively.\nOur ability to continue to provide our products and services to network participants, as well as to enhance our existing products and services and offer new products and services, is dependent on our information technology systems. If we are unable to manage and scale the technology associated with our business effectively, we could experience increased costs, reductions in system availability and losses of our network participants. Any failure of our systems in scalability and functionality would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of prepaid cards as a payment mechanism or there are adverse developments with respect to the prepaid financial services industry in general.\nAs the prepaid financial services industry evolves, consumers may find prepaid financial services to be less attractive than traditional or other financial services. Consumers might not use prepaid financial services for any number of reasons, including the general perception of our industry, new technologies, a decrease in our distribution partners\u2019 willingness to sell these products as a result of a more challenging regulatory environment or other factors outside of our control such as an economic recession. If consumers do not continue or increase their usage of prepaid cards, including making changes in the way prepaid cards are loaded, our operating revenues may decline. Any projected growth for the industry may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated. If consumer acceptance of prepaid financial services does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than expected or if there is a shift in the mix of payment forms, such as cash, credit cards, traditional debit cards and prepaid cards, away from our products and services, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nOur business is dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of computer network systems and data centers, including third party systems.\nOur ability to provide reliable service to customers and other network participants depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data centers as well as those of our retail distributors, network acceptance members and third-party processors. Our business involves the movement of large sums of money, the processing of large numbers of transactions and the management of the data necessary to do both. Our success in our account programs, including our BaaS programs, as well as our money movement services, depends upon the efficient and error-free handling of the money that is collected, remitted or deposited in connection with the provision of our products and services. We rely on the ability of our employees, systems and processes and those of the banks that issue our cards, our retail distributors, tax refund preparation partners, other\nbusiness partners and third-party processors to process and facilitate these transactions in an efficient, uninterrupted and error-free manner. Their failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our operating revenues and results of operations, particularly during the tax season, when we derive substantially all of our operating revenues for our tax refund processing services and a significant portion of our other operating revenues.\nOur systems and the systems of third-party processors are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, software or hardware defects, terrorist attacks, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic and similar events. We use both internally developed and third-party systems, including cloud computing and storage systems, for our services and certain aspects of transaction processing. Interruptions in our service may result for a number of reasons. Additionally, the data center hosting facilities that we use could be closed without adequate notice or suffer unanticipated problems resulting in lengthy interruptions in our service. Moreover, as we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we could experience problems transferring customer accounts and data, impairing the delivery of our service.\nWe are currently in the process of bringing processing in-house instead of using third-party processors. As a result, some customers may experience disruptions in service in connection with this ongoing project despite significant investments in planning and testing on the part of us and our processing technology partners. In addition, our inability to transition to in-house processing, or any failure by us to process transactions in a timely manner once we begin processing transactions, could cause significant disruptions to our customers and our business.\nAny damage to, or failure of, or delay in our processes or systems generally, or those of our vendors (including as a result of disruptions at our third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud providers), or an improper action by our employees, agents or third-party vendors, could result in interruptions in our service, causing customers, retail distributors and other partners to become dissatisfied with our products and services or obligate us to issue credits or pay fines or other penalties to them. Sustained or repeated process or system failures could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services, including our banking platform, and result in contract terminations, thereby reducing operating revenue and harming our results of operations. Further, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could be damaging to our reputation and may adversely impact use of our products and services, including our banking platform, and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and business partners. Additionally, some of our contracts with retail distributors, including our contract with Walmart, contain service level standards pertaining to the operation of our systems, and provide the retail distributor with the right to collect damages and potentially to terminate its contract with us for system downtime exceeding stated limits. If we face system interruptions or failures, our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to cover the losses or damages that we incur. In addition, our insurance costs may also increase substantially in the future to cover the costs our insurance carriers may incur.\nA data security breach could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, and could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues.\nWe and our retail distributors, tax preparation partners, network acceptance members, third-party processors and the merchants that accept our cards receive, transmit and store confidential customer and other information, including personal information, in connection with the sale and use of our products and services. Our encryption software and the other technologies we use to provide security for storage, processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information may not be effective to protect against data security breaches by third parties. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers, including state sponsored hackers. Our retail distributors, tax preparation partners, network acceptance members, other business partners, third-party processors and the merchants that accept our cards also may experience similar security breaches or discover securities vulnerabilities involving the receipt, transmission and storage of our confidential customer and other information. Improper access to our or these third parties\u2019 systems or databases could result in the theft, publication, deletion or modification of confidential customer and other information.\nA data security breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder or other customer or end-customer data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our products and services, reputational damage and claims or regulatory actions against us. Regardless of whether or not we are sued or face regulatory actions, a breach will require us to carefully assess the materiality of a cyber-attack. Depending on the nature and magnitude of the accessed data, this effort may require substantial resources. If we are sued in connection with any data security breach, we could be involved in protracted and costly litigation. If unsuccessful in defending that litigation, we might be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues and profitability. We would also likely have to pay (or indemnify the banks that issue our cards for) fines, penalties and/or other assessments imposed by Visa or MasterCard as a result of any data security breach. Further, a significant data security breach could lead to additional regulation, which could impose new and costly compliance obligations. In addition, a data security breach or perceived security\nvulnerability at one of the third-party banks that issue our cards or at our retail distributors, tax preparation partners, network acceptance members, other business partners, third-party processors or the merchants that accept our cards could result in significant reputational harm to us and cause the use and acceptance of our cards or other products and services to decline, either of which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating revenues and future growth prospects. Moreover, it may require substantial financial resources to address and remediate any such breach, including additional costs for hiring an external party to conduct a forensic investigation, replacement cards, manufacturing, distribution, re-stocking fees, fraud monitoring, and other added security measures, among others, which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data security liabilities actually incurred, will cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any incident, that insurance will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The assertion of large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protection laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.\nComplex existing and emerging local, state, and federal laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal information. These privacy laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal information, or to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business.\nReplacing third-party vendors would be difficult and disruptive to our business.\nSome services relating to our business, including fraud management and other customer verification services, cash processing, card production, and customer service, are outsourced to third-party vendors. We also depend on third-party banks to assist with our tax refund processing services. It would be difficult to replace some of our third-party vendors in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services during the term of their agreements with us or if they elected not to renew their contracts with us, and our business and operations would be adversely affected. Additionally, replacing third-party vendors with in-house solutions may lead to unanticipated operating costs and potential exposure to increased regulatory scrutiny. In particular, due to the seasonality in our business, any material service interruptions, service delays or changes in service contracts with key vendors during the tax season would result in losses that have an even greater adverse effect on that business than would be the case with our overall business.\nFurther, we have in the past and may in the future experience operational issues with the third-party call centers that we rely on to provide customer support. For example, many of our U.S. and international third-party call centers were closed during portions of the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in delayed responses to customers and a higher usage of automated services. While such issues have largely been resolved, these conditions contributed to transaction losses as compared to prior periods. Any prolonged closure or disruption in the services provided by such call centers would have an adverse effect on our business.\nSome of our operations, including a significant portion of our software development operations, are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to additional risks.\nWe have significantly expanded our software development operations in Shanghai, China and we expect to continue to increase headcount and infrastructure as we scale our operations in this region. A prolonged disruption at our China facility for any reason due to natural- or man-made disasters, outbreaks of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers, could potentially delay our ability to launch new products or services, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Additionally, as a result of our international operations, we face numerous other challenges and risks, including:\n\u2022increased complexity and costs of managing international operations;\n\u2022regional economic and geopolitical instability and military conflicts;\n\u2022limited protection of our intellectual property and other assets;\n\u2022compliance with and unanticipated changes in local laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022foreign currency exchange fluctuations relating to our international operating activities;\n\u2022local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices; and\n\u2022differing employment practices and labor relations.\nREGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive and potentially changing regulation and may be required to serve as a source of strength for Green Dot Bank.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions and must comply with applicable regulations and other commitments we have agreed to, including financial commitments with respect to minimum capital and leverage requirements. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we may become subject to formal or informal enforcement actions, proceedings, or investigations, which could result in regulatory orders, restrictions on our business operations or requirements to take corrective actions, which may, individually or in the aggregate, affect our results of operations and restrict our ability to grow. If we fail to comply with the applicable capital and leverage requirements, or if Green Dot Bank fails to comply with its applicable capital and leverage requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may limit our or Green Dot Bank's ability to pay dividends or fund stock repurchases, or if we become less than adequately capitalized, require us to raise additional capital. As a bank holding company and an FHC, we are generally prohibited from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies and FHCs. In addition, if at any time we or Green Dot Bank fail to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d or \u201cwell managed,\u201d we may not commence, or acquire any shares of a company engaged in, any activities only permissible for an FHC, without prior Federal Reserve approval. The restriction on our ability to commence, or acquire any shares of a company engaged in, any activities only permissible for an FHC, without prior Federal Reserve approval would also generally apply if Green Dot Bank received a CRA rating of less than \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d Currently, under the BHC Act, we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses. Such restrictions might limit our ability to pursue future business opportunities which we might otherwise consider, but which might fall outside the scope of permissible activities. U.S. bank regulatory agencies from time to time take supervisory actions under certain circumstances that restrict or limit a financial institution's activities, including in connection with examinations, which take place on a continual basis. In some instances, we are subject to significant legal restrictions on our ability to publicly disclose these actions or the full details of these actions, including those in examination reports. In addition, as part of the regular examination process, our and Green Dot Bank's regulators may advise us or our subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Such restrictions may include not being able to engage in certain categories of new activities or acquire shares or control of other companies.\nThe failure by Green Dot Bank to properly classify its deposits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe FDIC issued a final rule relating to the classification of brokered deposits, which became effective on April 1, 2021, with full compliance with certain provisions extended to January 1, 2022. The final rule establishes a new framework for analyzing certain provisions of the \u201cdeposit broker\u201d definition, including \u201cplacing deposits,\u201d \u201cfacilitating the placement of deposits\u201d and \u201cprimary purpose,\u201d for purposes of the classification of deposits as brokered deposits and exemptions from such a classification. As a result of the new rule, Green Dot Bank reclassified its deposits as non-brokered. We cannot predict how the FDIC will interpret the new rule and whether it will result in a change in the way our deposits are classified. If the FDIC determines that Green Dot Bank\u2019s deposits should actually be classified as brokered, such a finding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nFailure by us and our business partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe banking, financial technology, transaction processing and tax refund processing services industries are highly regulated, and failure by us, the banks that issue our cards or the businesses that participate in our reload network or other business partners to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could negatively impact our business. We are subject to state money transmission licensing requirements and a wide range of federal and other state laws and regulations. In particular, our products and services are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to protect consumers and to help detect and prevent money\nlaundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. For example, we are subject to the anti-money laundering reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the BSA, as amended by the PATRIOT Act.\nFrom time to time, federal and state legislators and regulatory authorities, including state attorney generals, increase their focus on the banking, consumer financial services and tax preparation industries and may propose and adopt new legislation or guidance that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for financial institutions and financial services companies. Accordingly, changes in laws and regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof may occur that could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant systems redevelopment, or render our products or services less profitable or obsolete, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, we could face more stringent anti-money laundering rules and regulations, as well as more stringent licensing rules and regulations, compliance with which could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, adverse rulings relating to the industries in which we participate could cause our products and services to be subject to additional laws and regulations, which could make our products and services less profitable. Further, with the current administration and leadership at federal agencies such as the CFPB, we expect that financial institutions will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted that further regulate specific banking practices, including with respect to the fees we are permitted to charge to customers.\nIf additional regulatory requirements were imposed on our bank or the sale of our products and services, the requirements could lead to a loss of retail distributors, tax preparation partners or other business partners, which could materially and adversely impact our operations. Moreover, if our products are adversely impacted by the interpretation or enforcement of these regulations or if we or any of our retail distributors or tax preparation partners were unwilling or unable to make such operational changes to comply with the interpretation or enforcement thereof, we would no longer be able to sell our products and services through that noncompliant retail distributor or tax preparation partner, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and operating results.\nFailure by us or those businesses to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, any of which could significantly harm our reputation with consumers, banks that issue our cards and regulators, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Many of these laws can be unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them could be difficult and costly. If new regulations or laws result in changes in the way we are regulated, these regulations could expose us to increased regulatory oversight, more burdensome regulation of our business, and increased litigation risk, each of which could increase our costs and decrease our operating revenues. Furthermore, limitations placed on the fees we charge or the disclosures that must be provided with respect to our products and services could increase our costs and decrease our operating revenues.\nChanges in rules or standards set by the payment networks, or changes in debit network fees or products or interchange rates, could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for acts or omissions by us or businesses that work with us, including card processors, such as MasterCard PTS. The termination of the card association registrations held by us or any changes in card association or other debit network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of existing rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide our products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, from time to time, card associations may increase the fees that they charge, which could increase our operating expenses, reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, a substantial portion of our operating revenues is derived from interchange fees. For the year ended December 31, 2021, interchange revenues represented 27% of our total operating revenues, and we expect interchange revenues to continue to represent a significant percentage of our total operating revenues. The amount of interchange revenues that we earn is highly dependent on the interchange rates that the payment networks set and adjust from time to time.\nThe enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to implement regulations that have substantially limited interchange fees for many issuers. While the interchange rates that may be earned by us and Green Dot Bank are exempt from the limitations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, there can be no assurance that future regulation or changes by the payment networks will not impact our interchange revenues substantially. If interchange rates decline, whether due to actions by the payment networks or future regulation, we would likely need to change our fee structure to offset the loss of interchange revenues. However, our ability to make these\nchanges is limited by the terms of our contracts and other commercial factors, such as price competition. To the extent we increase the pricing of our products and services, we might find it more difficult to acquire consumers and to maintain or grow card usage and customer retention, and we could suffer reputational damage and become subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. We also might have to discontinue certain products or services. As a result, our total operating revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business could be materially and adversely affected.\nLitigation or investigations could result in significant settlements, fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to regulatory oversight in the normal course of our business and have been and from time to time may be subject to securities class actions and other litigation or regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations. For example, on October 5, 2021, Republic Bank & Trust Company (\"Republic Bank\") filed a lawsuit against us in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges breach of the purchase agreement related to our proposed acquisition of Republic Bank's Tax Refund Solutions business. The original complaint sought injunctive relief or, in the alternative, monetary damages. Republic Bank has indicated that it may seek to amend the pleadings to add additional claims. The outcome of this litigation, and any other litigation and regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations is difficult to predict. Plaintiffs or regulatory agencies or authorities in these matters may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, seek to have aspects of our business suspended or modified or seek to impose sanctions, including significant monetary fines. The monetary and other impact of these actions, litigations, proceedings or investigations may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant. Further, an unfavorable resolution of litigation, proceedings or investigations against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. In this regard, such costs could make it more difficult to maintain the capital, leverage and other financial commitments at levels we have agreed to with the Federal Reserve Board and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. If regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations were to be initiated against us by private or governmental entities, adverse publicity that may be associated with these proceedings or investigations could negatively impact our relationships with retail distributors, tax preparation partners, network acceptance members, other business partners and card processors and decrease acceptance and use of, and loyalty to, our products and related services, and could impact the price of our Class A common stock. In addition, such proceedings or investigations could increase the risk that we will be involved in litigation. For the foregoing reasons, any regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations that are initiated against us by private or governmental entities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our brand and our intellectual property rights related to our products and services or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.\nThe Green Dot, GO2bank, MoneyPak, TPG and other brands and marks are important to our business, and we utilize trademark registrations and other means to protect them. Our business would be harmed if we were unable to protect our brand against infringement and its value was to decrease as a result. We also rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect the intellectual property rights related to our products and services. We currently have 13 issued patents, 2 published patents and 1 patent application pending. Although we generally seek patent protection for inventions and improvements that we anticipate will be incorporated into our products and services, there is always a chance that our patents or patent applications could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that an issued patent will not adequately cover the scope of our inventions or improvements incorporated into our products or services. Additionally, our patents could be circumvented by third parties.\nWe may unknowingly violate the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others and, thus, may be subject to claims by third parties. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the mobile technology field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its elements infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. Regardless of the merit of these claims, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to defending against these claims or to protecting and enforcing our own rights. We might also be required to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements and there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. Some of our intellectual property rights may not be protected by intellectual property laws, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. The loss of our intellectual property or the inability to secure or enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend successfully against an infringement action could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND INDEBTEDNESS\nWe might require additional capital to support our business in the future, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balances and any cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements, we will need to access additional capital to fund our operations. We may also need to raise additional capital to take advantage of new business or acquisition opportunities. However, we may not be able to raise needed cash in a timely basis on terms acceptable to us or at all. Financings, if available, may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders. The holders of new securities may also receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we were to raise cash through a debt financing, the terms of the financing might impose additional conditions or restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect our business. If we require new sources of financing but they are insufficient or unavailable, we would be required to modify our operating plans to take into account the limitations of available funding, which would harm our ability to maintain or grow our business. Should we require additional credit at levels we are unable to access, the cost of credit is greater than expected, or the cost-savings measures we have implemented are ineffective or result in us incurring greater costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. Further, additional borrowings on our revolving line of credit have and will cause us to incur additional interest expense, which will negatively affect our earnings.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictive covenants and financial ratio tests that restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions.\nUnder our $100 million five-year revolving facility, we are subject to various covenants that may have the effect of limiting, among other things, our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: merge with other entities, enter into a transaction resulting in a change in control, create new liens, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets outside of the ordinary course of business, enter into transactions with affiliates (other than subsidiaries) or substantially change the general nature of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 business, taken as a whole, make certain investments, enter into restrictive agreements, or make certain dividends or other distributions. These restrictions could limit our ability to take advantage of financing, merger, acquisition or other opportunities, to fund our business operations or to fully implement our current and future operating strategies. We must also maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50 and 1.25, respectively, at the end of any fiscal quarter. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests will be dependent upon our future performance and may be affected by events beyond our control (including factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\" section). If we fail to satisfy these requirements, our indebtedness under these agreements could become accelerated and payable at a time when we are unable to pay them. This would adversely affect our ability to implement our operating strategies and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nGENERAL RISKS\nOur operating results may fluctuate in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our quarterly and annual results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our Class A common stock, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our quarterly or annual results of operations might result from a number of factors including the occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in these risk factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the timing and volume of purchases and use of our products and services;\n\u2022the timing and volume of tax refunds or other government payments processed by us;\n\u2022the timing and success of new product or service introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022fluctuations in customer retention rates;\n\u2022changes in the mix of products and services that we sell or changes in the mix of our client retail distributors;\n\u2022the timing of commencement of new and existing product roll outs, developments and initiatives and the lag before those new products, channels or retail distributors generate material operating revenues;\n\u2022our ability to effectively sell our products through direct-to-consumer initiatives;\n\u2022costs associated with significant changes in our risk policies and controls;\n\u2022the amount and timing of major advertising campaigns, including sponsorships;\n\u2022the amount and timing of capital expenditures and operating costs;\n\u2022our ability to control costs, including third-party service provider costs and sales and marketing expenses;\n\u2022volatility in the trading price of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022changes in the political or regulatory environment affecting the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022economic recessions or uncertainty in financial markets, and the impact of inflation; and\n\u2022other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the other items included in these risk factors.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we issue guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will prove to be incorrect or will vary significantly from actual results. Actual results will vary from our guidance and the variations may be material, especially in times of economic uncertainty.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, integrate, retain and incentivize key personnel.\nOur ability to manage and grow our business will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, integrate, retain and recognize key personnel, namely our management team and experienced sales, marketing and program and technology development personnel. We may experience difficulty in managing transitions and assimilating newly-hired personnel, and if we fail to manage these transitions successfully, we could experience significant delays or difficulty in the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely harmed. Competition for qualified management, sales, marketing and program and technology development personnel can be intense. Competitors have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our top management and employees. In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive pay packages, including cash and equity-based compensation and the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. Additionally, our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team, work for us on an at-will basis and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Current nationwide job market dynamics, where the number of workers across the U.S. who quit their job in a single month in 2021 has broken multiple all-time U.S. records (referred to as the \"Great Resignation\"), further increases the challenge of employee retention.\nAcquisitions or investments, or the failure to consummate such transactions, could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe have in the past acquired, and we expect to acquire in the future, other businesses and technologies. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or successfully complete identified acquisitions. Failure to complete an acquisition could adversely affect our business as we could be required to pay a termination fee under certain circumstances or be subject to litigation (such as the recent lawsuit filed by Republic Bank), and our stock price may also suffer as the failure to consummate such an acquisition may result in negative perception in the investment community.\nFurther, the process of integrating an acquired business, product, service or technology can involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022increased regulatory and compliance requirements;\n\u2022implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\n\u2022diversion of management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business;\n\u2022integration and coordination of product, sales, marketing, program and systems management functions;\n\u2022transition of the acquired company\u2019s users and customers onto our systems;\n\u2022integration of the acquired company\u2019s systems and operations generally with ours;\n\u2022integration of employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022loss or termination, including costs associated with the termination or replacement of employees;\n\u2022liability for activities of the acquired company prior to the acquisition, including violations of law, commercial disputes, and tax and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022increased litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims brought by terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired business or technology or otherwise address these special risks and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of that acquisition, we might incur unanticipated liabilities, or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally. Furthermore, acquisitions and investments are often speculative in nature and the actual benefits we derive from them could be lower or take longer to materialize than we expect. In addition, to the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes. Future acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or goodwill impairment charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and negatively impact our stockholders.\nAn impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, our net goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our consolidated assets. Our net goodwill and intangible assets were $466.9 million as of December 31, 2021. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"), we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually or sooner if events occur that indicate impairment could exist, such as a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit\u2019s fair value, legal and regulatory factors, operating performance indicators, competition and other factors. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have in the past and may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis and might suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violate NYSE listing standards, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and could result in regulatory action, and could require us to restate our financial statements. Any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the SEC.\nOur business could be negatively affected by actions of stockholders.\nThe actions of stockholders could adversely affect our business. Specifically, certain actions of certain types of stockholders, including without limitation public proposals, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or special demands or requests, could disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming or divert the attention of our management and employees and increase the volatility of our stock. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of our stockholders may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable and need to make changes, which may be exploited by our competitors and make it more difficult to attract and retain personnel as well as customers, service providers and partners. Actions by our stockholders may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur charter documents, Delaware law and our status as bank holding company could discourage, delay or prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions under Delaware law, could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock, and result in the trading price of our Class A common stock being lower than it\notherwise would be. In addition to the foregoing, under the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, and their respective implementing regulations, Federal Reserve Board approval is necessary prior to any person or company acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company, subject to certain exceptions. Control, among other considerations, exists if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities, and may be presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more of any class of voting securities. These restrictions could affect the willingness or ability of a third party to acquire control of us for so long as we are a bank holding company.", "PERMNO": 11664, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "GDOT"}
