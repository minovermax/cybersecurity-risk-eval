{"cik": "1331875", "company": "Fidelity National Financial, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nGeneral\nWe have recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions, and an economic downturn could cause these balances to become impaired, requiring write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nGoodwill aggregated approximately $4,760 million, or 34.2% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2015. Current accounting rules require that goodwill be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstance indicating the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends. No goodwill impairment charge was recorded in 2015. However, if there is an economic downturn in the future, the carrying amount of our goodwill may no longer be recoverable, and we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization and the impact of the economy to determine if there is an impairment of goodwill in future periods.\nOur management has articulated a willingness to seek growth through acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our traditional areas of focus or geographic areas. This expansion of our business subjects us to associated\nrisks, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention and lack of experience in operating such businesses, and may affect our credit and ability to repay our debt.\nOur management has stated that we may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to or synergistic with our core operations. Accordingly, we have in the past acquired, and may in the future acquire, businesses in industries or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than we are with our core businesses. These activities involve risks that could adversely affect our operating results, such as diversion of management\u2019s attention and lack of substantial experience in operating such businesses. There can be no guarantee that we will not enter into transactions or make acquisitions that will cause us to incur additional debt, increase our exposure to market and other risks and cause our credit or financial strength ratings to decline.\nWe are a holding company and depend on distributions from our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company whose primary assets are the securities of our operating subsidiaries. Our ability to pay interest on our outstanding debt and our other obligations and to pay dividends is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to us. If our operating subsidiaries are not able to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to meet our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur title insurance subsidiaries must comply with state laws which require them to maintain minimum amounts of working capital, surplus and reserves, and place restrictions on the amount of dividends that they can distribute to us. Compliance with these laws will limit the amounts our regulated subsidiaries can dividend to us. During 2016, our title insurers may pay dividends or make distributions to us of approximately $334 million, however, insurance regulators have the authority to prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our title insurers to us if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders.\nThe maximum dividend permitted by law is not necessarily indicative of an insurer\u2019s actual ability to pay dividends, which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer\u2019s ratings or competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, depending on business and regulatory conditions, we may in the future need to retain cash in our underwriters or even contribute cash to one or more of them in order to maintain their ratings or their statutory capital position. Such a requirement could be the result of investment losses, reserve charges, adverse operating conditions in the current economic environment or changes in interpretation of statutory accounting requirements by regulators.\nThe loss of key personnel could negatively affect our financial results and impair our operating abilities.\nOur success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team and officers. If we lose one or more of these key employees, our operating results and in turn the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we have employment agreements with many of our officers, there can be no assurance that the entire term of the employment agreement will be served or that the employment agreement will be renewed upon expiration.\nFailure of our information security systems or processes could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, monetary losses, additional costs and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively.\nOur core operations are highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems. As part of our core operations, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit sensitive personal consumer data (such as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card and bank account information) and important business information of our customers. We also electronically manage substantial cash, investment asset and escrow account balances on behalf of ourselves and our customers, as well as financial information about our businesses generally. The integrity of our information systems and the protection of the information that resides on such systems are important to our successful operation. If we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure, adapt to emerging security threats or follow our internal business processes with respect to security, the information or assets we hold could be compromised. Further, even if we (or third parties to which we outsource certain IT services) maintain a reasonable, industry standard information security infrastructure, it is possible that unauthorized persons still could obtain access to information or assets we hold. These risks are increased when we transmit information over the internet and due to increasing security risks posed by organized crime. While, to date, we believe that we have not experienced a material breach of our information security systems, the existence or scope of such events is not always apparent. If additional information regarding an incident previously considered immaterial is discovered, or a new event were to occur, it could potentially have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, some laws and certain of our contracts require notification of various parties, including consumers or customers, in the event that confidential or personal information has or may have been taken or accessed by unauthorized third parties. Such notifications can result, among other things, in adverse publicity, distraction of management's time and energy, the attention of regulatory authorities, and fines and disruptions in sales, the effects of which may be material.\nFurther, our financial institution customers have obligations to safeguard their information technology systems and information. In certain of our businesses, we are bound contractually and/or by regulation to comply with the same requirements. If we fail to comply with these regulations and requirements, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract, governmental proceedings or the imposition of fines. In addition, if more restrictive privacy laws, rules or industry security requirements are\nadopted in the future on the federal or state level or by a specific industry in which we do business, that could have an adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on business processes. Any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches, or the perception that such breaches may occur, could inhibit our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and/or result in financial losses, litigation, increased costs or other adverse consequences to our business.\nIf economic and credit market conditions deteriorate, it could have a material adverse impact on our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio is exposed to economic and financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, credit markets and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. Our investment policy is designed to maximize total return through investment income and capital appreciation consistent with moderate risk of principal, while providing adequate liquidity and complying with internal and regulatory guidelines. To achieve this objective, our marketable debt investments are primarily investment grade, liquid, fixed-income securities and money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. We make investments in certain equity securities and preferred stock in order to take advantage of perceived value and for strategic purposes. In the past, economic and credit market conditions have adversely affected the ability of some issuers of investment securities to repay their obligations and have affected the values of investment securities. If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe own a minority interest in Ceridian, a leading provider of global human capital management and payment solutions. If the fair value of this company were to decline below book value, we would be required to write down the value of our investment, which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. If this company were to experience significant negative volatility in its results of operations it would have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations due to our inclusion of our portion of its earnings in our results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our outstanding debt was $2,793 million, including $1,403 million in variable rate debt. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, future business opportunities and capital expenditures; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (v) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vi) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more stringent covenants that could further restrict our business operations. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, issue dividends, make capital expenditures and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage.\nTitle\nIf adverse changes in the levels of real estate activity occur, our revenues may decline.\nTitle insurance revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity which includes sales, mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing. The levels of real estate activity are primarily affected by the average price of real estate sales, the availability of funds to finance purchases and mortgage interest rates.\nWe have found that residential real estate activity generally decreases in the following situations:\n\u2022\nwhen mortgage interest rates are high or increasing;\n\u2022\nwhen the mortgage funding supply is limited; and\n\u2022\nwhen the United States economy is weak, including high unemployment levels.\nDeclines in the level of real estate activity or the average price of real estate sales are likely to adversely affect our title insurance revenues. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (\"MBA\") Mortgage Finance Forecast as of February 18, 2016 estimates an approximately $1.5 trillion mortgage origination market for 2016, which would be a decrease of 6.3% from 2015. The MBA forecasts that the 6.3% decrease will result from a decrease in refinance activity, offset by a slight increase in forecast purchase\ntransactions. Our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate.\nIf financial institutions at which we hold escrow funds fail, it could have a material adverse impact on our company.\nWe hold customers' assets in escrow at various financial institutions, pending completion of real estate transactions. These assets are maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have a contingent liability relating to proper disposition of these balances for our customers, which amounted to $14.3 billion at December 31, 2015. Failure of one or more of these financial institutions may lead us to become liable for the funds owed to third parties and there is no guarantee that we would recover the funds deposited, whether through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage or otherwise.\nIf we experience changes in the rate or severity of title insurance claims, it may be necessary for us to record additional charges to our claim loss reserve. This may result in lower net earnings and the potential for earnings volatility.\nBy their nature, claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. From time to time, we experience large losses or an overall worsening of our loss payment experience in regard to the frequency or severity of claims that require us to record additional charges to our claims loss reserve. There are currently pending several large claims which we believe can be defended successfully without material loss payments. However, if unanticipated material payments are required to settle these claims, it could result in or contribute to additional charges to our claim loss reserves. These loss events are unpredictable and adversely affect our earnings.\nAt each quarter end, our recorded reserve for claim losses is initially the result of taking the prior recorded reserve for claim losses, adding the current provision to that balance and subtracting actual paid claims from that balance, resulting in an amount that management then compares to our actuary's central estimate provided in the actuarial calculation. Due to the uncertainty and judgment used by both management and our actuary, our ultimate liability may be greater or less than our current reserves and/or our actuary\u2019s calculation. If the recorded amount is within a reasonable range of the actuary\u2019s central estimate, but not at the central estimate, management assesses other factors in order to determine our best estimate. These factors, which are both qualitative and quantitative, can change from period to period and include items such as current trends in the real estate industry (which management can assess, but for which there is a time lag in the development of the data used by our actuary), any adjustments from the actuarial estimates needed for the effects of unusually large or small claims, improvements in our claims management processes, and other cost saving measures. Depending upon our assessment of these factors, we may or may not adjust the recorded reserve. If the recorded amount is not within a reasonable range of the actuary\u2019s central estimate, we would record a charge or credit and reassess the provision rate on a go forward basis.\nOur average provision for claim losses was 5.7% of title premiums in 2015. We will reassess the provision to be recorded in future periods consistent with this methodology and can make no assurance that we will not need to record additional charges in the future to increase reserves in respect of prior periods.\nOur insurance subsidiaries must comply with extensive regulations. These regulations may increase our costs or impede or impose burdensome conditions on actions that we might seek to take to increase the revenues of those subsidiaries.\nOur insurance businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance authorities in each state in which they operate. These agencies have broad administrative and supervisory power relating to the following, among other matters:\n\u2022\nlicensing requirements;\n\u2022\ntrade and marketing practices;\n\u2022\naccounting and financing practices;\n\u2022\ndisclosure requirements on key terms of mortgage loans;\n\u2022\ncapital and surplus requirements;\n\u2022\nthe amount of dividends and other payments made by insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ninvestment practices;\n\u2022\nrate schedules;\n\u2022\ndeposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing reserves; and\n\u2022\nregulation of reinsurance.\nMost states also regulate insurance holding companies like us with respect to acquisitions, changes of control and the terms of transactions with our affiliates. State regulations may impede or impose burdensome conditions on our ability to increase or maintain rate levels or on other actions that we may want to take to enhance our operating results. In addition, we may incur significant costs in the course of complying with regulatory requirements. Further, various state legislatures have in the past considered offering a public alternative to the title industry in their states, as a means to increase state government revenues.\nAlthough we think this situation is unlikely, if one or more such takeovers were to occur they could adversely affect our business. We cannot be assured that future legislative or regulatory changes will not adversely affect our business operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation.\u201d\nState regulation of the rates we charge for title insurance could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur title insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive rate regulation by the applicable state agencies in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Title insurance rates are regulated differently in various states, with some states requiring the subsidiaries to file and receive approval of rates before such rates become effective and some states promulgating the rates that can be charged. In almost all states in which our title subsidiaries operate, our rates must not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.\nRegulatory investigations of the insurance industry may lead to fines, settlements, new regulation or legal uncertainty, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time we receive inquiries and requests for information from state insurance departments, attorneys general and other regulatory agencies about various matters relating to our business. Sometimes these take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. We cooperate with all such inquiries and we have responded to or are currently responding to inquiries from multiple governmental agencies. Also, regulators and courts have been dealing with issues arising from foreclosures and related processes and documentation. Various governmental entities are studying the title insurance product, market, pricing, and business practices, and potential regulatory and legislative changes, which may materially affect our business and operations. From time to time, we are assessed fines for violations of regulations or other matters or enter into settlements with such authorities which may require us to pay fines or claims or take other actions.\nBecause we are dependent upon California and Texas for approximately 15.1% and 14.4% and of our title insurance premiums, respectively, our business may be adversely affected by regulatory conditions in Texas and/or California.\nCalifornia and Texas are the two largest sources of revenue for our title segment and, in 2015, California-based premiums accounted for 29.0% of premiums earned by our direct operations and 1.1% of our agency premium revenues. Texas-based premiums accounted for 17.7% of premiums earned by our direct operations and 11.0% of our agency premium revenues. In the aggregate, California and Texas accounted for approximately 15.1% and 14.4%, respectively, of our total title insurance premiums for 2015. A significant part of our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to our operations in California and Texas and to the prevailing regulatory conditions in California and Texas. Adverse regulatory developments in Texas and California, which could include reductions in the maximum rates permitted to be charged, inadequate rate increases or more fundamental changes in the design or implementation of the Texas and California title insurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the rating agencies downgrade our insurance companies, our results of operations and competitive position in the title insurance industry may suffer.\nRatings have always been an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Our title insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P, Moody\u2019s, A.M. Best, and Demotech. Ratings reflect the opinion of a rating agency with regard to an insurance company\u2019s or insurance holding company\u2019s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to investors. Our ratings are subject to continued periodic review by rating agencies and the continued retention of those ratings cannot be assured. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by those entities, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBlack Knight\nBlack Knight's clients and Black Knight are subject to various governmental regulations, and a failure to comply with government regulations or changes in these regulations could result in penalties, restrict or limit it or its clients\u2019 operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of Black Knight's clients and its businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Black Knight's failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could restrict its ability to provide certain services or result in imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity and loss of revenue.\nAs a provider of electronic data processing to financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, Black Knight is subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, an interagency body of the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, and various other federal and state regulatory authorities. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of the Black Knight operations to provide reports on internal controls for its clients\u2019 auditors and regulators. Black Knight may be subject to review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which it conducts its electronic processing activities.\nIn addition, Black Knight is subject to an increasing degree of compliance oversight by regulators and by its clients. Specifically, the CFPB has authority to write rules affecting the business of, supervise, conduct examinations of, and enforce compliance as to federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations with respect to certain \u201cnon-depository covered persons\u201d determined by the CFPB to be \u201clarger participants\u201d that offer consumer financial products and services. The CFPB and other financial institution regulators such as the OCC also have the authority to examine Black Knight in its role as a service provider to large financial institutions, although it is yet unclear how broadly they will apply this authority going forward. In addition, some of Black Knight's largest bank clients are subject to consent orders with the OCC and/or are parties to the National Mortgage Settlement, both of which require them to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their key vendors such as Black Knight.\nThe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, and related regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of real estate-related settlement services. RESPA also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services, such as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage. Notwithstanding these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed, so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided. RESPA and related regulations may to some extent restrict our real estate-related businesses from entering into certain preferred alliance arrangements. The CFPB is responsible for enforcing RESPA.\nChanges to laws and regulations and enhanced regulatory oversight of our clients and us may compel us to increase our prices in certain situations or decrease our prices in other situations, may restrict our ability to implement price increases, or otherwise limit the manner in which Black Knight conducts its business. In addition, in response to increased regulatory oversight, participants in the mortgage lending industry may develop policies pursuant to which they limit the extent to which they can rely on any one vendor or service provider. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to the new laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative impact on our clients, we may experience client losses or increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack Knight relies on its top clients for a significant portion of its revenue and profit, which makes it susceptible to the same macro-economic and regulatory factors that impact its clients. If these clients are negatively impacted by current economic or regulatory conditions or otherwise experience financial hardship or stress, or if the terms of its relationships with these clients change, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack Knight operates in a consolidated industry and as a result, a small number of its clients have accounted for a significant portion of its revenues. We expect that a limited number of Black Knight's clients will continue to represent a significant portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Black Knight's largest client, Wells Fargo, N.A., or Wells Fargo, accounted for approximately 12% of its consolidated revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Black Knight's five largest clients accounted for approximately 37% of its consolidated revenues.\nBlack Knight's clients face continued pressure in the current economic and regulatory climate. Many of Black Knight's relationships with these clients are long-standing and are important to its business and results of operations, but there is no guarantee that Black Knight will be able to retain or renew existing agreements or maintain its relationships on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, Black Knight relies on cross-selling its products and services to its existing clients as a source of growth. The deterioration in or termination of any of these relationships could significantly reduce its revenue and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, Black Knight may be disproportionately affected by declining revenue from, or loss of, a significant Black Knight client. In addition, by virtue of their significant relationships with us, these clients may be able to exert pressure on Black Knight with respect to the pricing of their services.\nThere may be consolidation in Black Knight's end client market, which would reduce the use of its services by its clients and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMergers or consolidations among existing or potential clients could reduce the number of Black Knight's clients and potential clients. If Black Knight's clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not Black Knight's clients, or that use fewer of Black Knight's services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of Black Knight's services. In addition, if potential clients merge, Black Knight's ability to increase its client base may be adversely affected and the ability of Black Knight's customers to exert pressure on Black Knight's pricing may increase. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on Black Knight's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Black Knight fails to adapt its solutions to technological changes or evolving industry standards, or if Black Knight's ongoing efforts to upgrade its technology are not successful, Black Knight could lose clients and have difficulty attracting new clients for its solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets for Black Knight's solutions are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards. Black Knight's future success will be significantly affected by Black Knight's ability to successfully enhance Black Knight's current solutions, and develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of Black Knight's clients and their customers. These initiatives carry the risks associated with\nany new product or service development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance issues. There can be no assurance that Black Knight will be successful in developing, marketing and selling new solutions and services that meet these changing demands, that Black Knight will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, and marketing of these solutions and services, or that Black Knight's new solutions and services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. If Black Knight's efforts are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on Black Knight's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack Knight operates in a competitive business environment and, if Black Knight is unable to compete effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets for Black Knight's solutions are intensely competitive. Black Knight's competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. Some of Black Knight's competitors have substantial resources. In addition, Black Knight expects that the markets in which Black Knight competes will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. There can be no assurance that Black Knight will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures Black Knight faces in the markets in which Black Knight operates will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, because many of Black Knight's larger potential clients have historically developed their key processing applications in-house and therefore view their system requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, Black Knight often competes against Black Knight's potential clients\u2019 in-house capacities. There can be no assurance that Black Knight's strategies for overcoming potential clients\u2019 reluctance to change will be successful, and if Black Knight is unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on Black Knight's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack Knight relies on proprietary technology and information rights, and if Black Knight is unable to protect its rights, it could have a material adverse effect on Black Knight's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack Knight's success depends, in part, upon its intellectual property rights. Black Knight relies primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect Black Knight's proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and Black Knight's intellectual property could be used by others without their consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to Black Knight's pending or future patent applications, and Black Knight's patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect Black Knight's intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect its intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause Black Knight's revenue from clients in the mortgage lending industry is affected by the strength of the economy and the housing market generally, including the volume of real estate transactions, a change in any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack Knight's revenue is primarily generated from technology, data and analytics Black Knight provides to the mortgage lending industry and, as a result, a weak economy or housing market may have a material adverse effect on Black Knight's business, financial condition and results of operations. The volume of mortgage origination and residential real estate transactions is highly variable and reductions in these transaction volumes could have a direct impact on the revenues Black Knight generates.\nThe revenues Black Knight generates from its servicing technology depend upon the total number of mortgage loans processed on its MSP platform, which tends to be comparatively consistent regardless of economic conditions. However, in the event that a difficult economy or other factors lead to a decline in levels of home ownership and a reduction in the number of mortgage loans outstanding and Black Knight is not able to counter the impact of those events with increased market share or higher fees, Black Knight's mortgage processing revenues could be adversely affected. Moreover, negative economic conditions, including increased unemployment or interest rates or a downturn in other general economic factors, among other things, could adversely affect the performance and financial condition of some of Black Knight's clients in many of its businesses, which may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations if these clients exit certain businesses.\nA weaker economy and housing market tend to increase the volume of consumer mortgage defaults, which can increase revenues from Black Knight's applications focused on supporting default management functions. However, government regulation of the mortgage industry in general, and the default and foreclosure process in particular, has greatly slowed the processing of defaulted mortgages in recent years and has changed the way many of its clients address mortgage loans in default. A downturn in the origination market and a concurrent slowdown or change in the way mortgage loans in default are addressed could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNFV\nOur operations could be adversely affected by the results of our acquired restaurant companies due to the risks inherent in that segment.\nOur acquired restaurant companies face certain risks that could negatively impact their results of operations. These risks include such things as the risks of unfavorable economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, unfavorable publicity, increasing food and labor costs, effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and the ability to compete successfully with other restaurants. In addition, risks related to supply chain, food quality, and protecting guests' personal information are inherent to the restaurant business. These companies are also subject to compliance with extensive government laws and regulations related to employment practices and policies and the manufacture, preparation, and sale of food and alcohol. If our restaurant companies are not able to respond effectively to one or more of these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of those businesses.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our FNFV Group Common Stock due to our Tracking Stock Capitalization\nHolders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock are common shareholders of FNF and are, therefore, subject to risks associated with an investment in FNF as a whole, even if a holder does not own shares of common stock of both of our groups.\nEven though we have attributed, for financial reporting purposes, all of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses to either the FNF Group or the FNFV Group in order to prepare separate financial results for each of these groups included herein, we retain legal title to all of our assets and our capitalization does not limit our legal responsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any disclosed financial results. Holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to the FNF Group or the FNFV Group and, in any liquidation, holders of FNF Group common stock and holders of FNFV Group common stock will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of our available net assets based on their respective numbers of liquidation units as specified in our certificate of incorporation (our \"Corporate Charter\").\nOur Board of Directors\u2019 ability to reattribute businesses, assets and expenses between tracking stock groups may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of either tracking stock group based on its past performance.\nOur Board of Directors is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to one tracking stock group to the other tracking stock group, without the approval of any of our shareholders, in accordance with our management and allocation policies and our Corporate Charter. Any such reattribution made by our Board of Directors, as well as the existence of the right in and of itself to effect a reattribution, may impact the ability of investors to assess the future prospects of either tracking stock group, including its liquidity and capital resource needs, based on its past performance. Shareholders may also have difficulty evaluating the liquidity and capital resources of each group based on past performance, as our Board of Directors may use one group\u2019s liquidity to fund the other group\u2019s liquidity and capital expenditure requirements through the use of inter-group loans and inter-group interests.\nWe could be required to use assets attributed to one group to pay liabilities attributed to the other group.\nThe assets attributed to one group are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to the other group, even if those liabilities arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to such other group. While our current management and allocation policies provide that reattributions of assets between groups will result in the creation of an inter-group loan or an inter-group interest or an offsetting reattribution of cash or other assets, no provision of our Corporate Charter prevents us from satisfying liabilities of one group with assets of the other group, and our creditors will not in any way be limited by our tracking stock capitalization from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have a tracking stock capitalization.\nThe market price of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock may not reflect the performance of the FNF Group and the FNFV Group, respectively, as we intend.\nWe cannot assure you that the market price of the common stock of a group will, in fact, reflect the performance of the group of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to that group. Holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock are common shareholders of FNF as a whole and, as such, will be subject to all risks associated with an investment in FNF and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of each class of stock of a group may simply reflect the performance of FNF as a whole or may more independently reflect the performance of some or all of the group of assets attributed to such group. In addition, investors may discount the value of the stock of a group because it is part of a common enterprise rather than a stand-alone entity.\nThe market price of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock may be volatile, could fluctuate substantially and could be affected by factors that do not affect traditional common stock.\nTo the extent the market prices of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock track the performance of more focused groups of businesses, assets and liabilities than the historic FNF Class A common stock did, the market prices of these new tracking stocks may be more volatile than the market price of FNF Class A common stock was historically. The market prices of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock may be materially affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in a group\u2019s operating results or in the operating results of particular companies attributable to such group;\n\u2022\npotential acquisition activity by FNF or the companies in which we invest;\n\u2022\nissuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by FNF or the companies in which we invest and the manner in which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to each of the groups;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding FNF Group common stock or FNFV Group common stock or the companies attributable to either of our tracking stock groups;\n\u2022\nthe complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of both of our tracking stocks, as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment in our stock; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nThe market value of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the assets and businesses attributed to either of the groups.\nBecause we are the issuer of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock, an adverse market reaction to events relating to the assets and businesses attributed to either of our groups, such as earnings announcements or announcements of new products or services, acquisitions or dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may cause an adverse reaction to the common stock of the other group. This could occur even if the triggering event is not material to us as a whole. A certain triggering event may also have a greater impact on one group than the same triggering event would have on the other group due to the asset composition of the affected group. In addition, the incurrence of significant indebtedness by us or any of our subsidiaries on behalf of one group, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with acquisitions of or investments in businesses, could affect our credit rating and that of our subsidiaries and, therefore, could increase the borrowing costs of businesses attributable to our other group or the borrowing costs of FNF as a whole.\nWe may not pay dividends equally or at all on FNF Group common stock or FNFV Group common stock.\nFNF has historically paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders. We have the right to pay dividends on the shares of common stock of each group in equal or unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends on the shares of common stock of one group and not pay dividends on shares of common stock of the other group. In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to either group will reduce our assets legally available to be paid as dividends on the shares relating to the other group.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our Board of Directors may make decisions that could adversely affect only some holders of our common stock.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of stock of one group might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of stock of the other group. In addition, given the nature of their businesses, there may be inherent conflicts of interests between the FNF Group and the FNFV Group. Our tracking stock groups are not separate entities and thus holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock do not have the right to elect separate Boards of Directors. As a result, our FNF\u2019s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to FNF as a whole and all of our shareholders as opposed to only holders of a particular group. Decisions deemed to be in the best interest of our Company and all of our shareholders may not be in the best interest of a particular group when considered independently. Examples include:\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the terms of any business relationships that may be created between the FNF Group and the FNFV Group or the terms of any reattributions of assets between the groups;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock to be received in connection with a merger involving FNF;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the groups, especially where the opportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of both groups;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one group but beneficial to the other;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the conversion of shares of common stock of one group into shares of common stock of the other, which the Board of Directors may make in its sole discretion, so long as the shares are converted (other than in connection with the disposition of all or substantially all of a group\u2019s assets) at a ratio that provides the shareholders of the converted stock with a premium based on the following requirements:\n(i) a 10% premium to such stock\u2019s market price for the first year following the recapitalization,\n(ii) an 8% premium to such stock\u2019s market price for the second year following the recapitalization,\n(iii) a 6% premium to such stock\u2019s market price for the third year following the recapitalization,\n(iv) a 4% premium to such stock\u2019s market price for fourth year following the recapitalization,\n(v) a 2% premium to such stock\u2019s market price for the fifth year following the recapitalization, and\n(vi) no premium to such stock\u2019s market price thereafter, with such premium to be based on, in each case, the market price of such stock over the 10 day trading period preceding the date on the which the Board of Directors determines to effect any such conversion; no conversion premium is available for a conversion in connection with the disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of either group;\n\u25aa\ndecisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any intergroup interest that one group may own in the other group;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to either of our groups;\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the dispositions of assets of either of our groups; and\n\u2022\ndecisions as to the payment of dividends on the stock relating to either of our groups.\nOur directors\u2019 or officers\u2019 ownership of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock may create or appear to create conflicts of interest.\nIf directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in FNF Group common stock or FNFV Group common stock, that disparity could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the holders of FNF Group common stock or FNFV Group common stock.\nWe have not adopted any specific procedures for consideration of matters involving a divergence of interests among holders of shares of stock relating to our two groups.\nRather than develop additional specific procedures in advance, our Board of Directors intends to exercise its judgment from time to time, depending on the circumstances, as to how best to:\n\u2022\nobtain information regarding the divergence (or potential divergence) of interests;\n\u2022\ndetermine under what circumstances to seek the assistance of outside advisers;\n\u2022\ndetermine whether a committee of our Board of Directors should be appointed to address a specific matter and the appropriate members of that committee; and\n\u2022\nassess what is in our best interest and the best interest of all of our shareholders.\nOur Board of Directors believes the advantage of retaining flexibility in determining how to fulfill its responsibilities in any such circumstances as they may arise outweighs any perceived advantages of adopting additional specific procedures in advance.\nOur Board of Directors may change the management and allocation policies following their implementation to the detriment of either group without shareholder approval.\nOur Board of Directors intends to adopt certain management and allocation policies as guidelines in making decisions regarding the relationships between the FNF Group and the FNFV Group with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits, inter-group loans, inter-group interests, attribution of assets, financing alternatives, corporate opportunities and similar items. These policies also set forth the initial focuses and strategies of these groups and the initial attribution of our businesses, assets and liabilities between them. Our Board of Directors may at any time change or make exceptions to these policies. Because these policies relate to matters concerning the day-to-day management of FNF as opposed to significant corporate actions, such as a merger involving FNF or a sale of substantially all of our assets, no shareholder approval is required with respect to policy adoption or amendment. A decision to change, or make exceptions to, these policies or adopt additional policies could disadvantage one group while advantaging the other.\nHolders of shares of stock relating to a particular group may not have any remedies if any action by our Directors or Officers has an adverse effect on only that stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our Corporate Charter may protect decisions of our Board of Directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of shares of stock relating to a particular group. Under Delaware law, the Board of Directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all shareholders, regardless of the stock held. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a Board of Directors owes an equal duty to all shareholders and does not have separate or additional duties to any subset of shareholders. Judicial opinions in Delaware involving tracking stocks have established that decisions by directors or officers involving differing treatment of holders of tracking stocks may be judged under the business judgment rule. In some circumstances, our directors or officers may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of shares relating to a particular group. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule referred to above, you may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that you believe have a disparate impact upon the shareholders of one of our groups if a majority of our Board of Directors is disinterested\nand independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the Board of Directors is acting in the best interest of FNF and our shareholders as a whole.\nShareholders will not vote on how to attribute consideration received in connection with a merger involving FNF among holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock.\nOur Corporate Charter does not contain any provisions governing how consideration received in connection with a merger or consolidation involving FNF is to be attributed to the holders of FNF Group common stock and holders of FNFV Group common stock, and none of the holders of FNF Group common stock or FNFV Group common stock will have a separate class vote in the event of such a merger or consolidation. Consistent with applicable principles of Delaware law, our Board of Directors will seek to divide the type and amount of consideration received in a merger or consolidation involving FNF among holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock in a fair manner. As the different ways our Board of Directors may divide the consideration between holders of stock relating to the different groups might have materially different results, the consideration to be received by holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock in any such merger or consolidation may be materially less valuable than the consideration they would have received if they had a separate class vote on such merger or consolidation.\nWe may dispose of assets of the FNF Group or the FNFV Group without your approval.\nDelaware law requires shareholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of FNF taken as a whole, and our Corporate Charter does not require a separate class vote in the case of a sale of a significant amount of assets of any of our groups. As long as the assets attributed to the FNF Group or the FNFV Group proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of our assets, we may approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of the assets of such group without any shareholder approval. If we dispose of all or substantially all of the assets attributed to any group (which means, for this purpose, assets representing 80% of the fair market value of the total assets of the disposing group, as determined by our Board of Directors), we would be required, if the disposition is not an exempt disposition under the terms of our Corporate Charter, to choose one or more of the following three alternatives:\n\u2022\ndeclare and pay a dividend on the disposing group\u2019s common stock;\n\u2022\nredeem shares of the disposing group\u2019s common stock in exchange for cash, securities or other property; and/or\n\u2022\nconvert all or a portion of the disposing group\u2019s outstanding common stock into common stock of the other group.\nIn this type of a transaction, holders of the disposing group\u2019s common stock may receive less value than the value that a third-party buyer might pay for all or substantially all of the assets of the disposing group. Our Board of Directors will decide, in its sole discretion, how to proceed and is not required to select the option that would result in the highest value to holders of any group of our common stock.\nHolders of FNF Group common stock or FNFV Group common stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to that group than if that group were a separate company.\nIf the FNF Group or the FNFV Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, shareholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than the holders of FNF Group common stock or FNFV Group common stock would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the group to which their shares relate. In addition, we cannot assure you that in the event of such a sale the per share consideration to be paid to holders of FNF Group common stock or FNFV Group common stock, as the case may be, will be equal to or more than the per share value of that share of stock prior to or after the announcement of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the applicable group. Further, there is no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of the shares of common stock of that group. Accordingly, if we sell all or substantially all of the assets attributed to the FNF Group or the FNFV Group, our shareholders could suffer a loss in the value of their investment in FNF.\nIn the event of a liquidation of FNF, holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock will not have a priority with respect to the assets attributed to the related tracking stock group remaining for distribution to shareholders.\nUnder the Corporate Charter, upon FNF\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of the FNF Group common stock and the FNFV Group common stock will be entitled to receive, in respect of their shares of such stock, their proportionate interest in all of FNF\u2019s assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of common stock in proportion to their respective number of \u201cliquidation units\u201d per share. Relative liquidation units will be based on the volume weighted average prices of the FNF Group common stock and the FNFV Group common stock over the 10 trading day period commencing shortly after the initial filing of the Corporate Charter. Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of either tracking stock upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of FNF will have nothing to do with the value of the assets attributed to the related tracking stock group or to changes in the relative value of the FNF Group common stock and the FNFV Group common stock over time.\nOur Board of Directors may in its sole discretion elect to convert the common stock relating to one group into common stock relating to the other group, thereby changing the nature of your investment and possibly diluting your economic interest in FNF, which could result in a loss in value to you.\nOur Corporate Charter permits our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, to convert all of the outstanding shares of common stock relating to either of our groups into shares of common stock of the other group so long as the shares are converted at a ratio that provides the shareholders of the converted stock with the applicable Conversion Premium (if any) to which they are entitled. A conversion would preclude the holders of stock in each group involved in such conversion from retaining their investment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance of the relevant group. We cannot predict the impact on the market value of our stock of (1) our Board of Directors\u2019 ability to effect any such conversion or (2) the exercise of this conversion right by FNF. In addition, our Board of Directors may effect such a conversion at a time when the market value of our stock could cause the shareholders of one group to be disadvantaged.\nHolders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock vote together and have limited separate voting rights.\nHolders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock vote together as a single class, except in certain limited circumstances prescribed by our Corporate Charter and under Delaware law. Each share of common stock of each group has one vote per share. When holders of FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock vote together as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes are in a position to control the outcome of the vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our shareholders or has a greater impact on one group than the other.\nOur capital structure, as well as the fact that the FNF Group and the FNFV Group are not independent companies may inhibit or prevent acquisition bids for the FNF Group or the FNFV Group and may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders.\nIf the FNF Group and the FNFV Group were separate independent companies, any person interested in acquiring the FNF Group or the FNFV Group without negotiating with management could seek control of that group by obtaining control of its outstanding voting stock, by means of a tender offer, or by means of a proxy contest. Although we intend FNF Group common stock and FNFV Group common stock to reflect the separate economic performance of the FNF Group and the FNFV Group, respectively, those groups are not separate entities and a person interested in acquiring only one group without negotiation with our management could obtain control of that group only by obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of FNF. The existence of shares of common stock relating to different groups could present complexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles, financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not present in companies that do not have capital structures similar to ours. Certain provisions of our Corporate Charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of FNF that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nclassifying our Board of Directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting who may call special meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors to persons friendly to our then current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of FNF.", "PERMNO": 90925, "SIC": 6361, "TIC": "FNF"}
