{"cik": "1356093", "company": "CREATIVE REALITIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the specific risks described below, and any risks described in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14, or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, before making an investment decision. See the section of this prospectus entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d Any of the risks we describe below could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects to be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INDUSTRY\nWe have generally incurred losses, and may never achieve profitability.\nExcept for the second and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, we have incurred net losses, have negative cash flows from operations and have a working capital deficit. We incurred net losses in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe have formulated our business plans and strategies based on certain assumptions regarding the acceptance of our business model and the marketing of our products and services. Nevertheless, our assessments regarding market size, market share, market acceptance of our products and services and a variety of other factors may prove incorrect. Our future success will depend upon many factors, including factors which may be beyond our control or which cannot be predicted at this time.\nOur digital marketing business is evolving in a rapidly changing market, and we cannot ensure the long-term successful operation of our business or the execution of our business plan.\nOur digital marketing technology and solutions are an evolving business offering and the markets in which we compete are rapidly changing. As a result, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. We may be unable to accomplish any of the following, which would materially impact our ability to implement our business plan:\n\u25cf establishing and maintaining broad market acceptance of our technology, solutions, services, and platforms, and converting that acceptance into direct and indirect sources of revenue;\n\u25cf establishing and maintaining adoption of our technology, solutions, services, and platforms in and on a variety of environments, experiences, and device types;\n\u25cf timely and successfully developing new technology, solution, service, and platform features, and increasing the functionality and features of our existing technology, solution, service, and platform offerings;\n\u25cf developing technology, solutions, services, and platforms that result in a high degree of customer satisfaction and a high level of end-customer usage;\n\u25cf successfully responding to competition, including competition from emerging technologies and solutions;\n\u25cf developing and maintaining strategic relationships to enhance the distribution, features, content and utility of our technology, solutions, services, and platforms;\n\u25cf identifying, attracting and retaining talented engineering, network operations, program management, technical services, creative services, and other personnel at reasonable market compensation rates in the markets in which we employ such personnel; and\n\u25cf integration of acquisitions.\nOur business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face in a cost-effective manner, if at all. If we are unable to successfully accomplish these tasks, our business will be harmed.\nAdequate funds for our operations may not be available, requiring us to raise additional financing or else curtail our activities significantly.\nWe will likely be required to raise additional funding through public or private financings, including equity financings in 2018. Any additional equity financings may be dilutive to shareholders and may be completed at a discount to the then-current market price of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, would likely involve restrictive covenants on our operations or pertaining to future financing arrangements. Nevertheless, we may not successfully complete any future equity or debt financing. Adequate funds for our operations, whether from financial markets, collaborative or other arrangements, may not be available when needed or on terms attractive to us. If adequate funds are not available, our plans to operate our business may be adversely affected and we could be required to curtail our activities significantly and/or cease operating.\nWe are reliant on the continued support of a related party for adequate financing of our operations.\nWe will likely be required to raise additional funding through public or private financings, including equity financings, through at least 2018. As of the date of this filing, the Company\u2019s majority shareholder and investor, Slipstream Communications LLC is the holder of 100% of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt instruments including the term loan, secured revolving promissory note and convertible promissory notes. If we are unable to extend the maturity or replace our existing financing agreements in the future, our plans to operate our business may be adversely affected and we could be required to curtail our activities significantly and/or cease operating.\nWe may be unable to implement our business plan if we cannot raise sufficient capital and may be required to pay a high price for capital.\nWe will need to obtain additional capital to implement our business plan and meet our financial obligations as they become due. We may not be able to raise the additional capital needed or may be required to pay a high price for capital. Factors affecting the availability and price of capital may include the following:\n\u25cf the availability and cost of capital generally;\n\u25cf our financial results;\n\u25cf the experience and reputation of our management team;\n\u25cf market interest, or lack of interest, in our industry and business plan;\n\u25cf the trading volume of, and volatility in, the market for our common stock;\n\u25cf our ongoing success, or failure, in executing our business plan;\n\u25cf the amount of our capital needs; and\n\u25cf the amount of debt, options, warrants, and convertible securities we have outstanding.\nWe may be unable to meet our current or future obligations or to adequately exploit existing or future opportunities if we cannot raise sufficient capital. If we are unable to obtain capital for an extended period of time, we may be forced to discontinue operations.\nWe expect that there will be significant consolidation in our industry. Our failure or inability to lead that consolidation would have a severe adverse impact on our access to financing, customers, technology, and human resources.\nOur industry is currently composed of a large number of relatively small businesses, no single one of which is dominant or which provides integrated solutions and product offerings incorporating much of the available technology. Accordingly, we believe that substantial consolidation may occur in our industry in the near future. If we do not play a positive role in that consolidation, either as a leader or as a participant whose capability is merged in a larger entity, we may be left out of this process, with product offerings of limited value compared with those of our competitors. Moreover, even if we lead the consolidation process, the market may not validate the decisions we make in that process.\nOur success depends on our interactive marketing technologies achieving and maintaining widespread acceptance in our targeted markets.\nOur success will depend to a large extent on broad market acceptance of our interactive marketing technologies among our current and prospective customers. Our prospective customers may still not use our solutions for a number of other reasons, including preference for static advertising, lack of familiarity with our technology, preference for competing technologies or perceived lack of reliability. We believe that the acceptance of our interactive marketing technologies by prospective customers will depend primarily on the following factors:\n\u25cf our ability to demonstrate the economic and other benefits attendant our marketing technologies;\n\u25cf our customers becoming comfortable with using our interactive marketing technologies; and\n\u25cf the reliability of our interactive marketing technologies.\nOur interactive technologies are complex and must meet stringent user requirements. Some undetected errors or defects may only become apparent as new functions are added to our technologies and products. The need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products and adversely affect our reputation. Delays, costs and damage to our reputation due to product defects could harm our business.\nOur financial condition and potential for continued net losses may negatively impact our relationships with customers, prospective customers and third-party suppliers.\nOur financial condition and potential for continued net losses may cause current and prospective customers to defer placing orders with us, to require terms that are less favorable to us, or to place their orders with competing marketing technology suppliers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. On the same basis, third-party suppliers may refuse to do business with us, or may do so only on terms that are unfavorable to us, which also could cause our revenue to decline.\nBecause we do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, the failure to obtain anticipated orders or the deferral or cancellation of commitments could have adverse effects on our business.\nOur business is characterized by short-term purchase orders and contracts that do not require that purchases be made. This makes forecasting our sales difficult. The failure to obtain anticipated orders and deferrals or cancellations of purchase commitments because of changes in customer requirements, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have experienced such challenges in the past and may experience such challenges in the future.\nOur continued growth could be adversely affected by the loss of several key customers, including a significant related party customer.\nOur largest customers account for a majority of our total revenue. We had two customers that accounted for 63% and 71% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In addition, we had three customers that accounted for 56% and 56% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Decisions by one or more of these key customers and/or partners to not renew, terminate or substantially reduce their use of our products, technology, services, and platform could substantially slow our revenue growth and lead to a decline in revenue. Our business plan assumes continued growth in revenue, and it is unlikely that we will become profitable without a continued increase in revenue.\nOur financial performance, condition and continued growth could be adversely affected by a key related party.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had sales of $3,390 and $1,344, respectively, with a related party entity that is 22.5% owned by a member of senior management. Accounts receivable due from the related party was $3,017 and $543 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nMost of our contracts are terminable by our customers with limited notice and without penalty payments, and early terminations could have a material effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMost of our contracts are terminable by our customers following limited notice and without early termination payments or liquidated damages due from them. In addition, each stage of a project often represents a separate contractual commitment, at the end of which the customers may elect to delay or not to proceed to the next stage of the project. We cannot assure you that one or more of our customers will not terminate a material contract or materially reduce the scope of a large project. The delay, cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of a large project or a number of projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIt is common for our current and prospective customers to take a long time to evaluate our products, most especially during economic downturns that affect our customers\u2019 businesses. The lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our operating results.\nIt is difficult for us to forecast the timing and recognition of revenue from sales of our products and services because our actual and prospective customers often take significant time to evaluate our products before committing to a purchase. Even after making their first purchases of our products and services, existing customers may not make significant purchases of those products and services for a long period of time following their initial purchases, if at all. The period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may be years with potentially an even longer period separating initial purchases and any significant purchases thereafter. During the evaluation period, prospective customers may decide not to purchase or may scale down proposed orders of our products for various reasons, including:\n\u25cf reduced need to upgrade existing visual marketing systems;\n\u25cf introduction of products by our competitors;\n\u25cf lower prices and sometimes free services (for limited periods of time) offered by our competitors; and\n\u25cf changes in budgets and purchasing priorities.\nOur prospective customers routinely require education regarding the use and benefit of our products. This may also lead to delays in receiving customers\u2019 orders.\nOur industry is characterized by frequent technological change. If we are unable to adapt our products and services and develop new products and services to keep up with these rapid changes, we will not be able to obtain or maintain market share.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, heavy competition and frequent new product and service introductions. If we fail to develop new products and services or modify or improve existing products and services in response to these changes in technology, customer demands or industry standards, our products and services could become less competitive or obsolete.\nWe must respond to changing technology and industry standards in a timely and cost-effective manner. We may not be successful in using new technologies, developing new products and services or enhancing existing products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Furthermore, even if we successfully adapt our products and services, these new technologies or enhancements may not achieve market acceptance.\nA portion of business involves the use of software technology that we have developed or licensed. Industries involving the ownership and licensing of software-based intellectual property are characterized by frequent intellectual-property litigation, and we could face claims of infringement by others in the industry. Such claims are costly and add uncertainty to our operational results.\nA portion of our business involves our ownership and licensing of software. This market space is characterized by frequent intellectual-property claims and litigation. We could be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual-property rights resulting in significant expense and the potential loss of our own intellectual-property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert copyright, trademark, patent or other intellectual-property rights to technologies that are important to our business. Any litigation to determine the validity of these claims, including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our business partners, regardless of their merit or resolution, would likely be costly and time consuming and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. If any such litigation resulted in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:\n\u25cf pay substantial damages;\n\u25cf cease the development, use, licensing or sale of infringing products;\n\u25cf discontinue the use of certain technology; or\n\u25cf obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur proprietary platform architectures and data tracking technology underlying certain of our services are complex and may contain unknown errors in design or implementation that could result in system performance failures or inability to scale.\nThe platform architecture, data tracking technology and integration layers underlying our proprietary platforms, our contract administration, procurement, timekeeping, content and network management, network services, device management, virtualized services, software automation and other tools, and back-end services are complex and include software and code used to generate customer invoices. This software and code is developed internally, licensed from third parties, or integrated by in-house personnel and third parties. Any of the system architecture, system administration, integration layers, software or code may contain errors, or may be implemented or interpreted incorrectly, particularly when they are first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to our tools and services are released. Consequently, our systems could experience performance failure or we may be unable to scale our systems, which may:\n\u25cf adversely impact our relationship with customers and others who experience system failure, possibly leading to a loss of affected and unaffected customers;\n\u25cf increase our costs related to product development or service delivery; or\n\u25cf adversely affect our revenues and expenses.\nOur business may be adversely affected by malicious applications that interfere with, or exploit security flaws in, our products and services.\nOur business may be adversely affected by malicious applications that make changes to our customers\u2019 computer systems and interfere with the operation and use of our products or products that impact our business. These applications may attempt to interfere with our ability to communicate with our customers\u2019 devices. The interference may occur without disclosure to or consent from our customers, resulting in a negative experience that our customers may associate with our products and services. These applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable, may reinstall themselves and may circumvent other applications\u2019 efforts to block or remove them. The ability to provide customers with a superior interactive marketing technology experience is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat these malicious applications fail, or if our products and services have actual or perceived vulnerabilities, there may be claims based on such failure or our reputation may be harmed, which would damage our business and financial condition.\nWe compete with other companies that have more resources, which puts us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe market for interactive marketing technologies is generally highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors or potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than us.\nWe expect competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products, services and technologies. Successful new product and service introductions or enhancements by our competitors could reduce sales and the market acceptance of our products and services, cause intense price competition or make our products and services obsolete. To be competitive, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. If we do not have sufficient resources to make these investments or are unable to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive, our competitive position will suffer. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on key personnel and our ability to attract and retain additional personnel.\nOur key personnel include:\n\u25cf Richard Mills, our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u25cf John Walpuck, our Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer; and\n\u25cf Will Logan, our Vice President of Finance.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel or to attract, retain and motivate other qualified employees, our ability to maintain and develop our business may be adversely affected. Our future success depends significantly on the continued service of our key technical, sales and senior management personnel and their ability to execute our growth strategy. The loss of the services of our key employees could harm our business. We may be unable to retain our employees or to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees who could migrate to other employers who offer competitive or superior compensation packages.\nUnpredictability in financing markets could impair our ability to grow our business through acquisitions.\nWe anticipate that opportunities to acquire similar businesses will materially depend on the trading price of our common stock and the availability of financing alternatives with acceptable terms. As a result, poor credit and other market conditions or uncertainty in financial markets could materially limit our ability to grow through acquisitions since such conditions and uncertainty will result in a lower trading price for our common stock and make obtaining financing more difficult.\nOur reliance on information management and transaction systems to operate our business exposes us to cyber incidents and hacking of our sensitive information if our outsourced service provider experiences a security breach.\nEffective information security internal controls are necessary for us to protect our sensitive information from illegal activities and unauthorized disclosure, in addition to denial of service attacks and corruption of our data. In addition, we rely on the information security internal controls maintained by an outsourced service provider. Breaches of our information management system could also adversely affect our business reputation. Finally, significant information system disruptions could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage operations or reliably report results.\nBecause our technology, products, platform, and services are complex and are deployed in and across complex environments, they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business.\nOur technology, proprietary platforms, products and services are highly complex and are designed to operate in and across data centers, large and complex networks, and other elements of the digital media workflow that we do not own or control. On an ongoing basis, we need to perform proactive maintenance services on our platform and related software services to correct errors and defects. In the future, there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services. We may not have in place adequate reporting, tracking, monitoring, and quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner. If we are unable to efficiently and cost-effectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified, or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services, we could experience loss of revenues and market share, damage to our reputation, increased expenses and legal actions by our customers.\nWe may have insufficient network or server capacity, which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues.\nOur operations are dependent in part upon: network capacity provided by third-party telecommunications networks; data center services and provider owned and leased infrastructure and capacity; the Company\u2019s dedicated and virtualized server capacity located at its data center services provider partner and a geo-redundant micro-data center location; and the Company\u2019s own infrastructure and equipment. Collectively, this infrastructure, equipment, and capacity must be sufficiently robust to handle all of our customers\u2019 web-traffic, particularly in the event of unexpected surges in high-definition video traffic and network services incidents. We may not be adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth and related infrastructure demands from our customers. In addition, the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons, including payment disputes, outages, or such service providers going out of business. Any failure of these service providers or the Company\u2019s own infrastructure to provide the capacity we require, due to financial or other reasons, may result in a reduction in, or interruption of, service to our customers, leading to an immediate decline in revenue and possible additional decline in revenue as a result of subsequent customer losses.\nWe do not have sufficient capital to engage in material research and development, which may harm our long-term growth.\nIn light of our limited resources in general, we have made no material investments in research and development over the past several years. In the long term, as a result of our failure to invest in research and development, our technology and product offerings may not keep pace with the market and we may lose any existing competitive advantage. Over the long term, this may harm our revenue growth and our ability to become profitable.\nOur business operations are susceptible to interruptions caused by events beyond our control.\nOur business operations are susceptible to interruptions caused by events beyond our control. We are vulnerable to the following potential problems, among others:\n\u25cf our platform, technology, products, and services and underlying infrastructure, or that of our key suppliers, may be damaged or destroyed by events beyond our control, such as fires, earthquakes, floods, power outages or telecommunications failures;\n\u25cf we and our customers and/or partners may experience interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or malicious actions of Internet users, hackers or current or former employees;\n\u25cf we may face liability for transmitting viruses to third parties that damage or impair their access to computer networks, programs, data or information. Eliminating computer viruses and alleviating other security problems may require interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers; and\n\u25cf failure of our systems or those of our suppliers may disrupt service to our customers (and from our customers to their customers), which could materially impact our operations (and the operations of our customers), adversely affect our relationships with our customers and lead to lawsuits and contingent liability.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in claims for consequential and other damages, significant repair and recovery expenses and extensive customer losses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations.\nOur business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions. Weakness in the United States and worldwide economy could have a negative effect on our operating results, including a decrease in revenue and operating cash flow. To the extent our customers are unable to profitably leverage various forms of digital marketing technology and solutions, and/or the content we create, deliver and publish on their behalf, they may reduce or eliminate their purchase of our products and services. Such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenues. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure, customer loss, slowdown in commerce over the Internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by our customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all. Suppliers on which we rely for equipment, field services, servers, bandwidth, co-location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on our operations or revenues. Flat or worsening economic conditions may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nThe markets in which we operate are rapidly emerging, and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors to our business.\nThe market in which we operate is becoming increasingly competitive. Our current competitors generally include general digital signage companies, specialized digital signage operators targeting certain vertical markets (e.g., financial services), content management software companies, or integrators and vertical solution providers who develop single implementations of content distribution, digital marketing technology, and related services. These competitors, including future new competitors who may emerge, may be able to develop a comparable or superior solution capabilities, software platform, technology stack, and/or series of services that provide a similar or more robust set of features and functionality than the technology, products and services we offer. If this occurs, we may be unable to grow as necessary to make our business profitable.\nWhether or not we have superior products, many of these current and potential future competitors have a longer operating history in their current respective business areas and greater market presence, brand recognition, engineering and marketing capabilities, and financial, technological and personnel resources than we do. Existing and potential competitors with an extended operating history, even if not directly related to our business, have an inherent marketing advantage because of the reluctance of many potential customers to entrust key operations to a company that may be perceived as unproven. In addition, our existing and potential future competitors may be able to use their extensive resources to:\n\u25cf develop and deploy new products and services more quickly and effectively than we can;\n\u25cf develop, improve and expand their platforms and related infrastructures more quickly than we can;\n\u25cf reduce costs, particularly hardware costs, because of discounts associated with large volume purchases and longer term relationships and commitments;\n\u25cf offer less expensive products, technology, platform, and services as a result of a lower cost structure, greater capital reserves or otherwise;\n\u25cf adapt more swiftly and completely to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements;\n\u25cf take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily; and\n\u25cf devote greater resources to the marketing and sales of their products, technology, platform, and services.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively in our various markets, or if competitive pressures place downward pressure on the prices at which we offer our products and services, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Our Company\nBecause of our limited resources, we may not have in place various processes and protections common to more mature companies and may be more susceptible to adverse events.\nWe have limited resources after accounting for a significant amount of restructuring and integration costs incurred in connection with prior acquisition activities, and we expect to incur additional restructuring and integration costs related to additional acquisitions in the future. As a result, we may not have in place systems, processes and protections that many of our competitors have or that may be essential to protect against various risks. For example, we have in place only limited resources and processes addressing human resources, timekeeping, data protection, business continuity, personnel redundancy, and knowledge institutionalization concerns. As a result, we are at risk that one or more adverse events in these and other areas may materially harm our business, balance sheet, revenues, expenses or prospects.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could limit our ability to detect and prevent fraud and thereby adversely affect our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Nevertheless, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Our inability to maintain an effective control environment may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our stock price. We have identified several material weaknesses in internal controls and have concluded in our 2017 filings that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nOur controlling shareholder possesses controlling voting power with respect to our common stock and voting preferred stock, which will limit your influence on corporate matters.\nOur controlling shareholder, Slipstream Communications, LLC, has beneficial ownership of 74,070,970 shares of common stock, including common shares that are beneficially owned by an affiliate of Slipstream Communications named Slipstream Funding, LLC. These shares represent beneficial ownership of approximately 58.39% of our common stock (on an as-converted basis) as of the date of this annual report on form 10-K. In addition, in the last quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, Slipstream Communications, LLC purchased all of our outstanding debt from the original debtholders. The terms of the debt have remained the same. As a result, Slipstream Funding has the ability to control our management and affairs through the election and removal of our entire Board of Directors and all other matters requiring shareholder approval, including the future merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change-of-control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders. Furthermore, this concentrated control will limit the practical effect of your participation in Company matters, through shareholder votes and otherwise.\nOur Articles of Incorporation grant our Board of Directors the power to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to designate other classes of preferred stock, all without shareholder approval.\nOur authorized capital consists of 250 million shares of capital stock. Pursuant to authority granted by our Articles of Incorporation, our Board of Directors, without any action by our shareholders, may designate and issue shares in such classes or series (including other classes or series of preferred stock) as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights, provided it is consistent with Minnesota law. The rights of holders of other classes or series of stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of our common stock. Furthermore, any issuances of additional stock (common or preferred) will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of then-current holders of our capital stock and may dilute our book value per share.\nSignificant issuances of our common stock, or the perception that significant issuances may occur in the future, could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nSignificant actual or perceived potential future issuance our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Generally, issuances of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, and the availability of shares for future sale could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could cause the market price of our common stock to remain low for a substantial amount of time.\nWe cannot foresee the impact of potential securities issuances of common shares on the market for our common stock, but it is possible that the market for our shares may be adversely affected, perhaps significantly. It is also unclear whether or not the market for our common stock could absorb a large number of attempted sales in a short period of time, regardless of the price at which they might be offered.\nOur common stock trades in an illiquid trading market.\nTrading of our common stock is conducted on the OTC Markets (OTCQX). This has an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of us and our common stock. This may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock if we were listed on a more liquid exchange.\nThere is not now and there may not ever be an active market for shares of our common stock.\nIn general, there has been minimal trading volume in our common stock. The small trading volume will likely make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their shares as and when they choose. Furthermore, small trading volumes are generally understood to depress market prices. As a result, investors and shareholders may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock publicly at the time and prices that such investors and shareholders feel are fair or appropriate.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We will, however, pay dividends on our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.\nWhen permitted by Minnesota law, we are required to pay dividends to the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, each share of which carries a $1.00 stated value. There are presently approximately 5.8 million shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding. All shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock were converted to common stock in September 2017. Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock entitles its holders to:\n\u25cf a cumulative 6% dividend, payable on a semi-annual basis in cash unless (i) we are unable to pay the dividend in cash under applicable law, or (ii) we have demonstrated positive cash flow during the prior quarter reported on our Form 10-Q, in which case we may at our election pay the dividend through the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock up through August 20, 2017 and thereafter through the issuance of additional shares of common stock;\n\u25cf in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, a preference in the amount of all accrued but unpaid dividends plus the stated value of such shares before any payment shall be made or any assets distributed to the holders of any junior securities, including our common stock;\n\u25cf convert their preferred shares into our common shares at a conversion rate of $0.255 per share, subject, however, to full-ratchet price protection in the event that we issue common stock below the then-current conversion price (subject to certain customary exceptions); and\n\u25cf vote their preferred shares on an as-if-converted basis.\nWe currently have the right to (1) call and redeem some or all of such preferred shares, subject to a 30-day notice period and certain other conditions, at a price equal to $1.00 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon and (2) pay all dividends in the form of shares of common stock. Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have no preemptive or cumulative-voting rights.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends for the foreseeable future on our common stock. Accordingly, any return on an investment in us will be realized only when a shareholder sells shares of our common stock. When legally permitted, we must expect to pay dividends to our preferred shareholders.\nWe do not have significant tangible assets that could be sold upon liquidation.\nWe have nominal tangible assets. As a result, if we become insolvent or otherwise must dissolve, there will be no tangible assets to liquidate and no corresponding proceeds to disburse to our shareholders.
