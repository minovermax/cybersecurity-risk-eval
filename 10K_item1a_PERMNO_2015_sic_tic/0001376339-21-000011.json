Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Common Stock involves a substantial risk of loss. Set forth below are summary descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material. We caution you to read the following risk factors, which have affected, and/or in the future could affect, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties are described under other captions in this report and should also be considered by our stockholders. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition or operating results could suffer. In this case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\u2022If we do not successfully execute our priorities, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022We are in a highly competitive and evolving field and face competition from well-established tissue processors and medical device manufacturers, as well as new market entrants.\n\u2022Rapid technological change could cause our products to become obsolete.\n\u2022Our products depend on the availability of tissue from human donors.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and societal responses thereto have adversely affected our business.\n\u2022We depend on our senior leadership team and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\n\u2022A portion of our revenues and accounts receivable come from government accounts.\n\u2022Our revenues depend on adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and health systems.\n\u2022Our revenue, results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a GPO or IDN.\n\u2022We contract with independent sales agents and distributors.\n\u2022Disruption of our processing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022To be commercially successful, we must convince physicians, where appropriate, that our products are proper alternatives to existing treatments and that our products should be used in their procedures.\n\u2022If we cannot successfully address quality issues that may arise with our products, our brand reputation could suffer, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022The formation of physician-owned distributorships (\u201cPODs\u201d) could result in increased pricing pressure on our products or harm our ability to sell our products to physicians who own or are affiliated with those distributorships.\n\u2022We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.\n\u2022Our products are derived from human tissue and therefore have the potential for disease transmission.\n\u2022We may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal.\n\u2022Significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We may expand or contract our business through acquisitions, divestitures, licenses, investments, and other commercial arrangements.\n\u2022New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\n\u2022Our international expansion and operations outside the U.S. expose us to additional risks.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Products and Other Government Regulations\n\u2022To the extent our products do not qualify for regulation as human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, this could result in removal of certain products from the market.\n\u2022If any of the BLAs are approved, the Company would be subject to additional regulation which will increase costs and could result in adverse sanctions for non-compliance. Obtaining and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals for certain of our products will be expensive and time consuming and may impede our ability to fully exploit our technologies\n\u2022Our business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the FDA and other authorities, which is costly.\n\u2022We may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved, or off-label, uses.\n\u2022We and our sales representatives must comply with various federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws.\n\u2022Our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.\n\u2022We may fail to obtain or maintain foreign regulatory approvals to market our products in other countries.\n\u2022Federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information may increase our costs and limit our ability to collect and use that information and subject us to liability if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022Our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate.\n\u2022We may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.\n\u2022We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets, proprietary or confidential information of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nRisks Related to the Audit Committee Investigation, Consolidated Financial Statements, Internal Controls and Related Matters\n\u2022We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Negative publicity has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022We are currently, and may in the future be, subject to substantial litigation and ongoing investigations that could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and result in harm to our business.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022Our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.\n\u2022The restrictive covenants in the Hayfin Loan Agreement, and the Company\u2019s obligation to make debt payments under the Hayfin Loan Agreement, limit our operating and financial flexibility.\n\u2022Our variable rate indebtedness under the Hayfin Loan Agreement subjects us to interest rate risk.\n\u2022EW Healthcare Partners and its interests may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\n\u2022Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of, our common shareholders.\n\u2022Our Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of our Common Stock, and any such conversion may dilute the value of our Common Stock.\n\u2022The price of our Common Stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile.\n\u2022Securities analysts may elect not to report on our common stock or may issue negative reports that adversely affect the stock price.\n\u2022Fluctuations in revenue or results of operations could cause additional volatility in our stock price.\n\u2022We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock.\n\u2022Certain provisions of Florida law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage or prevent a change of control.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we do not successfully execute our priorities, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur priorities are, in our core wound care business, to demonstrate the value of our existing portfolio, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of our sales force using intensive analytics, and deploying clinical support and economic data to educate healthcare professionals on the efficacy of our products; over the course of 2011, we plan to increase the number of sales personnel by approximately 10%, and to increase the number of Medical Science Liaisons to further support medical education initiatives. The Company is also focused on advancing our late-stage pipeline and accelerating efforts toward seeking FDA approval for AmnioFix Injectable, also designated as mdHACM, to treat musculoskeletal degeneration across multiple indications, and our plans include investments in Research and Development, publishing additional peer-reviewed clinical, scientific and economic data that further reinforce the differentiation of our products and to expand the utility of the Company\u2019s placentally-derived products in other clinical applications throughout the care continuum; and enhancing business and product development efforts, targeting new applications and potential products that fit within our framework of innovative technologies backed by rigorous science, that elevate the standard of care.\nWe have sought and may continue to seek capital to implement our priorities. In developing our priorities, we evaluated many factors including, without limitation, those related to developments in our industry, customer demand, competition, regulatory developments, and general economic conditions. Actual conditions may be different from our assumptions, and we may not be able to successfully execute our priorities. If we do not successfully execute our priorities, or if actual results vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe are in a highly competitive and evolving field and face competition from well-established tissue processors and medical device manufacturers, as well as new market entrants.\nOur business is in a very competitive and evolving field. Competition from other tissue processors, medical device companies, and biotherapeutic companies, and from research and academic institutions, is intense, expected to increase and subject to rapid change and could be significantly affected by new product introductions. Established competitors and newer market entrants are investing in additional clinical research that may allow them to gain further clinician usage, adoption and payer coverage of their products. In addition, consolidation and cost containment measures in the healthcare industry may cause hospitals to consolidate their purchases with suppliers that have a broad portfolio of products. This would continue to give rise to demands for price concessions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, competitors may introduce placental-based membrane products in the future at lower prices, adding new features or gaining additional reimbursement coverage, or utilize sales and marketing practices that negatively impact the industry. Further, they may copy our products outside the United States. The presence of this competition may lead to pricing pressure, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRapid technological change could cause our products to become obsolete and, if we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe technologies underlying our products are subject to rapid and profound technological change. Competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known. Others may develop services, products or processes with significant advantages over the products, services and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop. Any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe plan to enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressure and technologies. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022properly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;\n\u2022acquire, through licensing, co-development or outright purchase, new technology developed outside of MiMedx;\n\u2022develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022adequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products; and\n\u2022obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements.\nIf we do not develop and, when necessary, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations and financial condition will suffer. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and\nresources, including additional capital, before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development, or they may never receive required regulatory approval and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nOur products depend on the availability of tissue from human donors, and any disruption in supply could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our human tissue products depends upon, among other factors, the availability of tissue from human donors. Any failure to obtain tissue from our sources will interfere with our ability to effectively meet demand for our products incorporating human tissue. The availability of donated tissue could also be adversely impacted by regulatory changes, public opinion of the donor process and our own reputation in the industry. We may not be successful in our ability to scale tissue recovery efforts to meet the potential future demand of our pipeline. Obtaining adequate supplies of human tissue involves several risks, including limited control over availability (for example, access to hospital accounts and the number of consenting mothers), quality and delivery schedules. In addition, any interruption in the supply of any human tissue component could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found. We also utilize third-party providers of placental donations on an as-needed basis to mitigate risks but there can be no assurance that these third parties will be able to provide donated tissues at all times. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and societal responses thereto have adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition, and the continuation of the pandemic or the outbreak of other health epidemics could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and societal responses thereto have adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition, and will likely continue to do so. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations.\u201d The continuation or additional waves of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our operations and increase our costs and expenses in numerous ways. For example:\n-We source raw materials for our products from donated placentas from scheduled C-section births via a large, geographically-diverse network of donor hospitals. We may experience shortages of donated placentas if donors or our recovery specialists are excluded from hospitals, or if our donor recovery specialists contract COVID-19 and are required to quarantine. In the second half of March 2020, we experienced interruptions for approximately two months from a portion of our hospitals in certain geographic areas. To date, we have been successful in mitigating this disruption to our supply by adding additional donor hospitals, increasing efforts at hospitals that did not impose access limits, and using third-party providers of donated placentas (where necessary and in accordance with MiMedx quality standards). However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to source raw materials for our products will continue to be successful, and we may experience shortages of raw materials, especially if the current pandemic or responses thereto intensify. Additionally, we may experience shortages of donated placentas if additional testing protocols are implemented for donated tissues based on guidance issued by the American Association of Tissue Banks, the FDA, or other standards, and are screened as ineligible.\n-We process donated tissue using aseptic techniques in a controlled environment. However, the manufacturing space is a confined space area in which an infected employee may spread the virus to other employees despite the use of personal protective equipment required for all areas at MiMedx. To date, we have been successful in mitigating these risks through a variety of measures, including screening employees for COVID-19 prior to entering our facilities, implementing a number of safety protocols, and partnering with a testing facility to provide test kits and rapid results for employees that have symptoms or have a known risk of exposure. Additionally, in anticipation of expected disruptions, in the first quarter of 2020 we ran manufacturing at levels greater than demand and were successful in building our inventory of safety stock. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to prevent wide scale infections among our processing staff will continue to be successful, especially if the current pandemic or responses thereto intensify. If we experience wide scale infections among our production staff, we may experience a shortage of finished goods.\n-Our ability to sell our products has been hampered by the pandemic. In many areas of the country, our sales force was excluded from hospitals and the offices of other health care providers. Additionally, many patients stayed away from hospitals and other medical facilities. This had an adverse effect on our revenues beginning late in the first quarter of\n2020 and continuing into April. By mid-May, access restrictions to hospitals and offices of healthcare providers had eased for our sales force, and significant numbers of patients began to return for treatment, including for elective procedures. This trend continued into the third and fourth quarters of 2020, where we saw net sales generally consistent with the comparable periods from 2019 on an \u201cas-shipped\u201d basis. In certain areas, local or regional surges of COVID-19 have continued, and future sales will depend on patients\u2019 willingness and ability to visit healthcare providers for care, and our sales force\u2019s access to healthcare providers. The timing, impact, and response to the pandemic has been uneven across the country. Subsequent waves may have a greater impact than did the first wave depending on a myriad of factors, including, but not limited to, the availability and efficacy of vaccines, the emergence and severity of new variants of the virus, infection rates, mitigation efforts, and societal response. We are not able to estimate the future effect of COVID-19 on patient behavior and, consequently, future demand or the ability of providers to pay for our products.\n-Similarly, our clinical researchers, clinical study coordinators, and their patients experienced restrictions in their access to hospitals and ability to access other healthcare providers, which slowed enrollment in our clinical trials. For example, from mid-March through mid-May 2020, many patients stayed away from hospitals and other medical facilities, which stalled enrollments in our clinical trials. We have since concluded enrollment in our three IND trials. However, if such access were to be restricted again, it might impair or delay the initiation, approval and launch of future products or additional clinical trials. See \u201cTo the extent our products do not qualify for regulation as human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (\u201cSection 361\u201d), this could result in removal of the applicable products from the market, would make the introduction of some new tissue products more expensive and could significantly delay the expansion of our tissue product offerings and subject us to additional post-market regulatory requirements.\u201d\nIf our leadership, employees, sales agents, suppliers, medical professionals, or users of our products are impacted by an epidemic, by illness, or through social distancing, quarantine or other precautionary measures, then our manufacturing operations, sales, demand for our products, and clinical trials may be adversely affected.\nDisruptions to the health care system generally, such as if patients are unable or unwilling to visit health care providers, or if health care providers prioritize treatment of acute or communicable illnesses over wound care, have and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole, or how long such effects will endure. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our senior leadership team and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and success are materially dependent on attracting and retaining members of our senior leadership team to formulate and execute the Company\u2019s business plans. Since June 2018, we have replaced a majority of our senior leadership team, and hired several new senior leaders including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, Executive Vice President - Research and Development, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer.\nLeadership changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause material disruption to our business or management team. Changes in senior management could also lead to an environment that presents additional challenges in recruiting and retaining employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We experienced difficulties in recruiting due to legal and business uncertainties resulting from the issues which were the subject of the Audit Committee Investigation.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, including sales, managerial and technical personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find and attract additional qualified employees to support our expected growth or retain any such personnel.\nA portion of our revenues and accounts receivable come from government accounts.\nSome of our revenues are derived from sales, both direct and through a distributor, to the government. Any disruption of our products on the Federal Supply Schedule (\u201cFSS\u201d), or of the use of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contracts (\u201cIDIQ\u201d), or any change in the way the government purchases products like ours or the price it is willing to pay for our products, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In April 2020, the Company announced that it had resolved an issue for $6.5 million that it self-disclosed to the VA concerning the eligibility of one of its products for inclusion in the Company\u2019s FSS contract. Any resulting negative impact to our contractual relationship with the VA going forward may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues depend on adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and health systems.\nOur success depends on the extent to which our customers receive adequate reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private insurers and health systems. Government and other third-party payers attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of medical products, particularly new products. Therefore, significant uncertainty may exist as to the reimbursement status of new healthcare products by third-party payers. Although EpiFix has coverage with the majority of large payers, a significant number of public and private insurers and health systems currently do not cover or reimburse our other products.\nIf we are not successful in obtaining adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products from these third-party payers, it could have an adverse effect on market acceptance of our products. Inadequate reimbursement levels would likely also create downward price pressure on our products. Even if we do succeed in obtaining widespread coverage and reimbursement rates or policies for our products, future changes in coverage or reimbursement rates or policies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we have experienced some reluctance by payers to cover products for applications other than those for which we have published clinical efficacy data. Currently, there are three MACs that do not have a written medical policy in the form of a Local Coverage Determination (\u201cLCD\u201d) or a specific article for skin substitutes. In the absence of an LCD, MACs will reimburse based on medical necessity. If these three MACs created written medical policy criteria that limit providers to the use of products that have published clinical evidence for a specific wound type such as Diabetic Foot Ulcer or Venous Leg Ulcer only, we could experience a negative impact on revenue. Our future revenues could experience additional declines if other MACs or other payers further limit their coverage of our products to specific clinical uses. This decline would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue, results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a GPO or IDN.\nAs with many manufacturers in the healthcare space, the Company contracts with GPOs and IDNs to establish contracted pricing and terms and conditions for the members of GPOs and IDNs. Approximately three-quarters of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 came from customers that are members of our primary GPOs or IDNs.\nOur agreements with GPOs and IDNs allow us to sell our products efficiently to large groups of customers. Our agreements with GPOs and IDNs typically provide their members with favorable ordering terms and conditions and access to favorable product pricing. These customers purchase our product through GPO and IDN arrangements in part because of favorable pricing and terms and conditions. If our agreement with any GPO or IDN is terminated or expires without being extended, renewed or renegotiated this could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe contract with independent sales agents and distributors.\nIn 2020, approximately 20% of our sales were through our relationships with independent agents and distributors. (Sales agents act directly on behalf of MiMedx to arrange sales, while distributors take title to product and may set their own prices.) See Note 15, \u201cRevenue Date by Customer Type.\u201d\nBecause our agents and distributors are not employees, there is a risk we will be unable to ensure that our sales processes, compliance safeguards, and related policies will be adhered to despite our communication and training of agents and distributors regarding these requirements. Further, if we fail to maintain relationships with our key independent agents, or fail to ensure that our independent agents adhere to our sales processes, compliance safeguards and related policies, there could be an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAlso, if our relationships with our independent sales agents or distributors were terminated for any reason, it could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. Because the independent agent often controls the customer relationships within its territory, there is a risk that if our relationship with the agent ends, our relationship with the customer will be lost.\nWe may obtain the assistance of additional distributors and independent sales representatives to sell products in certain sales channels, particularly in territories and fields where agents are commonly used. Our success is partially dependent upon our ability to train, retain and motivate our independent sales agencies, distributors, and their representatives to appropriately and compliantly sell our products in certain territories or fields. They may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans or compliance safeguards. Some of our independent sales agencies and distributors do not sell our products exclusively and may offer similar products from other companies. Our independent sales agencies and distributors may terminate their contracts with us, may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products or may focus their sales efforts on other products that produce greater commissions for them, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also may not be able to find additional independent sales agencies and distributors who will agree to appropriately and compliantly market or distribute our products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to establish new independent sales representative and distribution relationships or renew current sales agency and distribution agreements on commercially acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDisruption of our processing facilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends upon the continued operation of our processing facilities in Marietta, Georgia and Kennesaw, Georgia. Risks that could impact our ability to use these facilities include the occurrence of natural and other disasters, the outbreak of pandemics, and the need to comply with the requirements of directives from government agencies, including the FDA. See below, for example, \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and societal responses thereto have adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition, and the continuation of COVID-19 or the outbreak of other health epidemics could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\u201d\nEither of our two processing facilities can serve as a redundant processing facility for our Section 361 products in the event the other facility experiences a disaster event. For our 351 products, we have transitioned manufacturing to our Kennesaw, Georgia facility to comply with CGMP standards, and implemented these standards for upstream and downstream supply chain activities at our Marietta, Georgia facility. However, the unavailability of our processing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations during the period of such unavailability.\nTo be commercially successful, we must educate physicians, where appropriate, how and when our products are proper alternatives to existing treatments and that our products should be used in their procedures.\nWe believe physicians will only use our products if they determine, based on their independent medical judgment and experience, clinical data, and published peer reviewed journal articles, that the use of our products in a particular procedure is a favorable alternative to other treatments. Physicians may be hesitant to change their existing medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022their lack of experience with advanced therapeutics, such as our placenta-based allografts;\n\u2022lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits of advanced therapeutics, such as our placenta-based allografts, over conventional methods in certain therapeutic applications;\n\u2022perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022limited availability of reimbursement from third-party payers;\n\u2022more favorable reimbursement for other market-available products; and\n\u2022the time that must be dedicated to physician training in the use of our products.\nIf we cannot successfully address quality issues that may arise with our products, our brand reputation could suffer, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products, as any quality issues or defects may negatively impact physician use of our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, we may not be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely impacted. We must also ensure any promotional claims made for our products comport with government regulations.\nThe formation of physician-owned distributorships (\u201cPODs\u201d) could result in increased pricing pressure on our products or harm our ability to sell our products to physicians who own or are affiliated with those distributorships.\nPODs are medical product distributors that are owned, directly or indirectly, by physicians. These physicians derive a proportion of their revenue from selling or arranging for the sale of medical products for use in procedures they perform on their own patients at hospitals that agree to purchase from or through the POD, or that otherwise furnish ordering physicians with income that is based directly or indirectly on those orders of medical products. The Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) of the Department of Health & Human Services has issued a Special Fraud Alert on PODs, indicating that they are inherently suspect under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nOur commercial strategy emphasizes selling directly to healthcare providers and, to a limited extent, through distributors. To our knowledge, we do not directly sell to or distribute any of our products through PODs. The number and strength of PODs in the industry may continue to grow as economic pressures increase throughout the industry and hospitals, insurers and physicians search for ways to reduce costs, and, in the case of the physicians, identify additional sources to increase their incomes. These companies and the physicians who own, or partially own, PODs may have significant market knowledge, access to and influence on the physicians who use our products and the hospitals that purchase our products, and we may not be able to compete effectively for business from physicians who own PODs.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, processing and marketing of human tissue products. We may be subject to such claims if our products cause, or appear to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by patients, healthcare providers or others selling our products. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend (regardless of merit), divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us, harm our reputation, and generate adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal of, or reduced acceptance of, our products in the market.\nAlthough we have product liability insurance that we believe is adequate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations, and we may not be able to maintain this insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms or be able to secure increased coverage (if needed), nor can we be sure that existing or future claims against us will be covered by our product liability insurance. Moreover, the existing coverage of our insurance or any rights of indemnification and contribution that we may have may not be sufficient to offset existing or future claims. If we are unable to maintain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims or we underestimate the amount of insurance we need, we could be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could result in significant costs and significant harm to our business. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such claim would be time-consuming and expensive, may damage our reputation in the marketplace, and would likely divert our management\u2019s attention.\nThe products we manufacture and process are derived from human tissue and therefore have the potential for disease transmission.\nThe utilization of human tissue creates the potential for transmission of communicable disease, including, without limitation, human immunodeficiency virus, viral hepatitis, syphilis and other viral, fungal or bacterial pathogens. We are required to comply with federal and state regulations intended to prevent communicable disease transmission.\nWe maintain strict quality controls designed in accordance with CGTPs to ensure the safe procurement and processing of our tissue, including terminal sterilization of our products. These controls are intended to prevent the transmission of communicable disease. However, risks exist with any human tissue implantation. We are also in the process of implementing CGMP systems to comply with the regulations that will apply to our Section 351 HCT/Ps, and believe this provides an added level of quality throughout our manufacturing process. However, negative publicity concerning disease transmission from other companies\u2019 improperly processed donated tissue could have a negative impact on the demand for our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal, which could significantly increase our costs, damage our reputation, disrupt our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe processing and marketing of our tissue products involves an inherent risk that our tissue products or processes may not meet applicable quality standards and requirements. In the event that one or more of our products experiences a failure to meet such standards and requirements, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority.\nFor example, in March 2020, MiMedx submitted to the FDA a biological product deviation report (\u201cBPDR\u201d) regarding tissue recovered from four donors in Palm Beach County, Florida. These tissues were recovered by a third-party recovery partner. At the time of recovery, Palm Beach County had only just been designated as an area of active Zika transmission by the Center for Disease Control. In February 2020, our recovery partner received an FDA 483 observation for recovering and providing this tissue to MiMedx. MiMedx contacted each facility that received allografts containing the subject tissues. Following MiMedx\u2019s submission of the BPDR to the FDA, the FDA notified MiMedx that this event meets the formal definition of a \u201crecall\u201d and classified it as a Class II recall on the FDA\u2019s recall website. As of the date of this filing, there have been no adverse reactions reported as a result of this submission and notification.\nA recall or market withdrawal of one of our products could be costly and may divert management resources. A recall or withdrawal of one of our products, or a similar product processed by another entity, also could impair sales of our products as a result of confusion concerning the scope of the recall or withdrawal, or as a result of the damage to our reputation for quality and safety.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nA breach of cybersecurity, a disruption in availability, or the unauthorized alteration of systems or data could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We rely on technology for day-to-day operations as well as positioning to enhance our stance in the market. We generate intellectual property that is central to the future success of the business and transmit large amounts of confidential information. Additionally, we collect, store and transmit confidential information of customers, patients, employees and third parties. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure, and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The continually changing threat landscape of cybersecurity today makes our systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners, and vendors, and from attacks by malicious third parties, including supply chain attacks originating at our third-party partners. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication. Attacks are made by individuals or groups that have varying levels of expertise, some of which are technologically advanced and well-funded including, without limitation, nation states, organized criminal groups and hacktivists organizations.\nTo ensure protection of our information, we have invested in cybersecurity and have implemented processes and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. We measure these controls and their success through a cybersecurity framework that is based on industry standards. While we have invested in the protection of our data and technology, there can be no guarantees that our efforts will prevent all service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal and reputational harm to our business, including legal claims and proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties, as well as remediation costs. We maintain cyber liability insurance. However, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nWe may expand or contract our business through acquisitions, divestitures, licenses, investments, and other commercial arrangements with other companies or technologies, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to acquire companies or divest divisions, technologies, products, and rights through licenses, distribution agreements, investments, and outright acquisitions to grow our business. In connection with one or more of those transactions, we may, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in the Hayfin Loan Agreement:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute the value of equity currently held by our shareholders\u037e\n\u2022divest or license existing products or technology;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022incur debt that could have terms unfavorable to us or that we might be unable to repay;\n\u2022structure the transaction in a manner that has unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit a step-up in the tax basis for the assets acquired;\n\u2022be unable to realize the anticipated benefits, such as increased revenues, cost savings, or synergies from additional sales;\n\u2022be unable to secure the services of key employees related to the transaction(s); and\n\u2022be unable to succeed in the marketplace with the transaction(s).\nAny of these items could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Business acquisitions also involve the risk of unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business, which could be material. Incurring unknown liabilities or the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction could adversely affect our business if we are unable to recover our initial investment. Inability to recover our investment, or any write off of such investment, associated goodwill or assets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement or may acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or are evolving. In developing and marketing new lines of business and new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international expansion and operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe are pursuing further expansion outside the U.S. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming and expensive. Our ability to conduct international operations is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations. Also, the sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws, including, without limitation, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. International regulations may also limit what promotional claims we may make for our products.\nCompliance with these regulations and laws is costly, and failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could adversely affect us in a variety of ways that include, without limitation, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities.\nThese risks may limit or disrupt our expansion, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation. Operating outside of the U.S. also requires significant management attention and financial resources.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Products and Other Government Regulations\nTo the extent our products do not qualify for regulation as human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (\u201cSection 361\u201d), this could result in removal of the applicable products from the market, would make the introduction of some new tissue products more expensive and could significantly delay the expansion of our tissue product offerings and subject us to additional post-market regulatory requirements.\nThe products we manufacture and process are derived from human tissue. Amniotic and other birth membrane are generally regulated as Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue - Based Products (\u201cHCT/P\u201d) and are therefore eligible to be subject to regulation solely under Section 361 (\u201cSection 361 HCT/P\u201d) depending on whether the specific product at issue and the claims made for it are consistent with the applicable criteria. HCT/Ps that do not meet these criteria are subject to more extensive regulation as drugs, medical devices, biological products, or combination products. These HCT/Ps must comply with both the FDA\u2019s requirements for HCT/Ps and the requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including pre-market clearance or approval from the FDA. Obtaining FDA pre-market clearance or approval involves significant time and investment by the Company.\nIn November 2017, the FDA released a guidance document entitled \u201cRegulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue - Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\u201d The document confirmed the FDA\u2019s stance that all micronized amniotic products require a biologics license to be lawfully marketed in the United States. It also confirmed that sheet forms of amniotic tissue are appropriately regulated as solely Section 361 HCT/Ps when manufactured in accordance with 21 CFR Part 1271 and intended for use as a barrier or covering. The final guidance also stated that the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion under limited conditions with respect to the IND application and pre-market approval requirements for certain HCT/Ps for a limited period following the date of the Guidance. The FDA\u2019s approach is risk-based, and the Guidance clarified that high-risk products and uses could be subject to immediate enforcement action.\nMiMedx continues to market our micronized and particulate products under the policy of enforcement discretion as we work to transition certain Section 361 products to Section 351 products. Our sales of such products for all uses was $32.8 million, and $42.4 million, and $68.4 million, respectively, in 2020, 2019, and 2018. At the same time, we are pursuing the BLA pre-market approval process for certain of our micronized products, as more fully discussed under \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d Following the period of enforcement discretion under the Guidance, we may need to cease selling our micronized products and other products regulated under Section 351 until the FDA approves a BLA, and then we will only be able to market such products for indications and doses that have been approved in a BLA. The loss of our ability to market and sell our micronized products would have an adverse impact on our revenues, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, the Company currently markets EpiCord and AmnioCord, tissue products derived from human umbilical cord, as providing a protective environment or as a barrier. The Company has become aware that the FDA may view the basic function of human umbilical cord as a conduit, based on warning letters to several companies marketing human umbilical cord derived products for a variety of uses, which raises the risk that the FDA will take the position that MiMedx\u2019s marketing of human umbilical cord products may not be a homologous use. To our knowledge, the FDA has not indicated this publically or to MiMedx however, if FDA determines that EpiCord and AmnioCord do not meet the requirements for regulation solely under Section 361, then pre-market clearance or approval under Section 351 will be required. While we expect that the enforcement discretion period described in the 2017 Guidance would apply to the umbilical cord tissue derived products, following the period of enforcement discretion, we may need to cease selling our umbilical cord derived products until the FDA grants a pre-market approval or clearance, and then we will only be able to market such products for indications that have been cleared or approved by the FDA. The loss of our ability to market and sell our umbilical cord derived products would have an adverse impact on our revenues, business, financial condition and results of operations. Included in net sales were sales of umbilical cord derived products totaling $16.6 million, $17.9 million, and $14.7 million, respectively, in 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nIn July 2020, the FDA extended its period of enforcement discretion to May 31, 2021. In doing so, the FDA stated,\nThis will give manufacturers additional time to determine if they need to submit an investigational new drug (IND) or marketing application and, if such an application is needed, to prepare the IND or marketing application. Such additional time is warranted in light of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, which has presented unique challenges in recruiting clinical trial participants and carrying out clinical trials.\nIn addition, the FDA might, at some future point, modify the scope of its enforcement discretion, or extend the period of enforcement discretion, or change its position on which current or future products qualify as Section 361 HCT/Ps, or determine that some or all of our micronized products may not be lawfully marketed under the FDA\u2019s policy of enforcement discretion.\nAny regulatory changes could have adverse consequences for us and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct our business by requiring pre-market clearance or approval and compliance with additional post-market regulatory requirements with respect to those products. It is also possible that the FDA could decide it will not allow the Company to market any form of a micronized product during the rest of the enforcement discretion period without the pre-market approval, and it could even require the Company to recall its micronized products. We expect that following the expiration of its enforcement discretion period, sales of micronized amniotic tissue will be limited to those products and indications for which applicants have received a BLA or other pre-market approval. Also, our micronized products may be used by healthcare professionals or physicians for more indications than those for which we presently intend to pursue BLAs, as well as in other dosages. If the FDA does allow the Company to continue to market a micronized form of its sheet allografts within the period of enforcement discretion or any extension, the FDA may impose conditions, such as labeling restrictions, and the requirement that the product be manufactured in compliance with CGMP. Although the Company is preparing for these requirements in connection with its pursuit of a BLA for certain of its products, earlier compliance with these conditions would require significant additional time and cost investments by the Company. Moreover, increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate could lead to increased regulation of HCT/Ps, including Section 361 HCT/Ps, which could ultimately increase our costs and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the FDA approves the BLAs we seek, we will incur increased compliance costs on an ongoing basis. See \u201cIf any of the BLAs are approved, the Company would be subject to additional regulation which will increase costs and could result in adverse sanctions for non-compliance.\u201d\nIf any of the BLAs are approved, the Company would be subject to additional regulation which will increase costs and could result in adverse sanctions for non-compliance.\nProducts subject to the FDA\u2019s BLA requirements must comply with a range of pre- and post-market provisions. Pre-market compliance includes the conduct of clinical trials in support of BLA approval, the development and submission of a BLA, and the production of product for use in the clinical trials that meets FDA\u2019s quality expectations. We have been making enhancements in our fixed plant as well as incurring costs and reduced product yields from testing products to ensure quality, identity, purity, and potency. Post-approval requirements for BLA products include: compliance with CGMPs, which will require us to comply with promotional and labeling requirements, which limit our ability to make claims about regulated products\u037e submission of annual reports in appropriate circumstances\u037e compliance with the FDA\u2019s \u201cBiological Product Deviation Reporting System,\u201d when applicable\u037e submission of adverse events\u037e reporting and correcting product problems within established timeframes\u037e recalling or stopping the manufacture of a product if a significant problem is detected\u037e complying with the appropriate laws and regulations relevant to the biologics licensed and identifying any changes needed to help ensure product quality. In some instances, the FDA can also require that applicants conduct post-market studies or trials of the product. This additional compliance burden may increase costs, and failure to comply with such requirements may subject the Company to sanctions that would have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nObtaining and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals for certain of our products will be expensive and time consuming and may impede our ability to fully exploit our technologies.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a biological product or medical device from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. may be costly and time consuming, and such clearances or approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. We are pursuing approval of BLAs for certain of our micronized products, but have not yet submitted a BLA for review. Additionally, the FDA may take the position that some of the other products that we currently market require a BLA as well. Some of the future products and enhancements to our current products that we expect to develop or may acquire and market may require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA. However, clearance or approval may not be granted with respect to any of our products or enhancements and further FDA review may add delays that could adversely affect our ability to market such products or enhancements.\nThe process of obtaining an approved BLA, including clinical trial development and execution as well as manufacturing processes, requires the expenditure of substantial time, effort and financial resources and may take years to complete. The fee for filing a BLA and program fees payable with respect to any establishment that manufactures biologics are substantial. Additionally, there are significant costs associated with clinical trials that can be difficult to accurately estimate until a BLA is approved. Clinical trials may not be successful or may return results that do not support approval. Moreover, data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, or we may decide not to pursue a BLA for certain products or indications, or need to conduct additional trials for a given indication. Additionally, the FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. If we do receive approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or doses, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Our revenues will be adversely affected if we fail to obtain BLA approvals on a timely basis or at all, if the FDA\nrequires us to stop marketing our products until a BLA is approved, or if the FDA limits the indications for use or requires other conditions that restrict the commercial application of our products.\nBased on a review of the studies and interim results, the Company has instituted several actions with respect to its ongoing and planned clinical trials to address the resources, capabilities, and expertise needed for commercial launch including our strategy around an increased dialogue with the FDA regarding our BLA progress. If the BLAs we seek are approved, we will incur increased compliance costs on an ongoing basis. See \u201cIf any of the BLAs are approved, the Company would be subject to additional regulation which will increase costs and could result in adverse sanctions for non-compliance.\u201d\nOur business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the FDA and other authorities, which is costly, and our failure to comply could result in negative effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, the FDA has specific regulations governing our tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers, even for Section 361 HCT/Ps. The FDA\u2019s regulation of HCT/Ps includes requirements for registration and listing of products, donor screening and testing, processing and distribution, labeling, record keeping and adverse-reaction reporting, and inspection and enforcement.\nHCT/Ps that are regulated as drugs, biological products or medical devices are subject to even more stringent regulation by the FDA. Even if pre-market clearance or approval is obtained, the approval or clearance may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which the product may be marketed or to whom it may be marketed, may require warnings to accompany the product or impose additional restrictions on the sale or use of the product. In addition, regulatory approval is subject to continuing compliance with regulatory standards, including the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA regulations regarding our tissue products, the FDA could take enforcement action, including, without limitation, any of the following sanctions and the manufacture of our products or processing of our tissue could be delayed or terminated:\n\u2022untitled letters, warning letters, cease and desist orders, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;\n\u2022recall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022refusing our requests for clearance or approval of new products;\n\u2022withdrawing or suspending current applications for approval or approvals already granted;\n\u2022refusal to grant export approval for our products; and\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA\u2019s regulation of HCT/Ps may continue to evolve. Complying with any such new regulatory requirements may entail significant time delays and expense, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe American Association of Tissue Banks (\u201cAATB\u201d) has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become an accredited tissue bank. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations.\nIn addition, procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act (\u201cNOTA\u201d), which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks, hospitals and physicians for their services associated with the recovery and storage of donated human tissue. Although we have independent third party appraisals that confirm the reasonableness of the service fees we pay, if we were to be found to have violated NOTA\u2019s prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we potentially would be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFinally, we and other manufacturers of skin substitutes are required to provide average selling price (\u201cASP\u201d) information to CMS on a quarterly basis. The Medicare payment rates are updated quarterly based on this ASP information. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, such manufacturer is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied, and potential False Claims Act liability. See \u201cWe and our sales representatives, whether employees or independent contractors, must comply with various federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, any breach of which could cause an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved, or off-label, uses.\nAs a general rule, FDA regulations require the marketing of 361 HCT/Ps only for appropriate homologous uses, and the promotion of pre-approved biological products or devices for FDA-approved indications. Generally, unless the products are approved by the FDA for alternative uses, the FDA contends that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products, or promote them as safe or effective for uses other than those specifically approved by the FDA. Such limitations present a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales, marketing and support activities, though designed to comply with all FDA requirements, constitute the promotion of our products for an unapproved use in violation of the federal FD&C Act. We also face the risk that the FDA or other governmental authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that we have discontinued or changed, including sales activities, prior marketing materials, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nInvestigations concerning the promotion of unapproved product uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of the law, we may face significant legal action, fines, penalties, and even criminal liability and may be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant and educational activities. There is also a possibility that we could be enjoined from selling some or all of our products for any unapproved use. In addition, as a result of an enforcement action against us or any of our executive officers, we could be excluded from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nHowever, the FDA\u2019s Guidance stated that the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion under limited conditions with respect to IND application and pre-market approval requirements for certain HCT/Ps through May 31, 2021. This means that, through May 31, 2021, the FDA does not intend to enforce certain provisions as they currently apply to certain entities or activities. During the period of enforcement discretion, we have marketed, and intend to continue to market, our micronized products while at the same time pursuing a BLA for certain of our micronized products. We have already filed IND applications for three indications for our micronized product: plantar fasciitis, knee osteoarthritis, and Achilles tendonitis. We also intend to file the appropriate investigative application for both AmnioFill and for EpiFix Micronized, as well as an additional IND for AmnioFix Injectable in the first half of 2021; we are currently in the clinical trial design and planning stage, but have not yet initiated any clinical trials in furtherance of any additional regulatory approvals for these products.\nNevertheless, while we believe we are in compliance with the FDA's Guidance on HCT/Ps and enforcement discretion regarding products that do not meet some or all of the HCT/P requirements, there can be no assurance that we have correctly interpreted FDA Guidance, or that the FDA will not suspend its enforcement discretion and, in such cases, we may need to discontinue marketing a product and/or may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved uses. Such regulatory penalties by the FDA could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe and our sales representatives, whether employees or independent contractors, must comply with various federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, any breach of which could cause an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur relationships with physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers are subject to various federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex and, in some instances, even minor or inadvertent violations can give rise to liability. Possible sanctions for violation of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws include, without limitation, monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participating in the federal and state healthcare programs, including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) health programs and TRICARE (the healthcare program administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed service members, including both those in active duty and retirees, as well as their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws, imposing substantial penalties for violations. A finding of a violation of one or more of these laws, or even a government investigation or inquiry into the same, would likely result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock, as well as on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal law that prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward referrals, purchases or orders or arranging for or recommending the purchase, order or referral of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n(the \u201cPPACA\u201d) amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify the intent that is required to prove a violation. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute as amended, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. The PPACA also amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d). A conviction for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute results in criminal fines and requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that protect certain common industry practices from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and arrangements may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not fully satisfy all elements of an available exception or safe harbor. We have entered into consulting agreements, speaker agreements, research agreements and product development agreements with physicians, including some who may order or recommend our products or make decisions to use them. In addition, some of these physicians own our stock, which they purchased in arm\u2019s-length transactions on terms identical to those offered to non-physicians, or received stock awards from us in the past as consideration for services performed by them. While we believe these transactions generally meet the requirements of applicable laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and analogous state laws, it is possible that our arrangements with physicians and other providers may be questioned by regulatory or enforcement authorities under such laws, which could lead us to redesign the arrangements and subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties. We have designed our policies and procedures to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, FCA, and industry best practices. In addition, we have conducted training sessions on these principles. If, however, regulatory or enforcement authorities were to view these arrangements as non-compliant with applicable laws, there would be risk of government investigations/inquiries or penalties. There is also risk that one or more of our employees or agents will disregard the rules we have established. Because our strategy relies on the involvement of physicians who consult with us on the design of our products, perform clinical research on our behalf or educate other health care professionals about the efficacy and uses of our products, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with physicians who refer or order our products to be in violation of applicable laws. This could harm our reputation and the reputations of the physicians we engage to provide services on our behalf. In addition, the cost of noncompliance with these laws could be substantial since we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from federally-funded healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, VA and TRICARE.\nThe FCA imposes civil liability on any person or entity that knowingly submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity to sue on behalf of the government to recover civil penalties and treble damages as a whistleblower. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after January 29, 2018, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015.\nManufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The PPACA provides that claims tainted by a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false for purposes of the FCA. The Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) on behalf of the government has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors, violated the FCA, resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into onerous corporate integrity agreements with the government that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions, as well as oversight and review by an outside entity, an Independent Review Organization (\u201cIRO\u201d), at substantial expense to the Company.\nUnder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) criminal federal healthcare fraud statute, it is a crime to knowingly and willfully execute, or attempt to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.\nThere are federal and state laws requiring detailed reporting of manufacturer interactions with and payments to healthcare providers, such as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (\u201cSunshine Act\u201d). The Sunshine Act requires, among others, \u201capplicable manufacturers\u201d of drugs, devices, biological products, and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to annually report to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to \u201ccovered recipients.\u201d The term covered recipients includes U.S.-licensed physicians and teaching hospitals, and, for reports submitted on or after January 1, 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. While manufacturers of human cell and tissue products regulated\nsolely under Section 361 are not subject to the Sunshine Act, in the future, if we receive a BLA, we will be subject to this law. There is the risk that CMS or another government agency may take the position that our products are not human cell and tissue products regulated solely under Section 361, and thereby assert that we are currently subject to the Sunshine Act, which could subject us to civil penalties and the administrative burden of having to comply with the law.\nThere are state law equivalents to the Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA. There are also so-called state \u201call-payer\u201d anti-kickback laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, as well as when no insurer is involved (i.e. cash-pay patients).\nThe enforcement of all of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change. Federal or state regulatory or enforcement authorities may investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any investigation or challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any state or federal regulatory or enforcement review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether these changes are retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the U.S. federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. In the U.S., the PPACA was enacted in 2010 with a goal of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several provider types, including hospitals.\nIn addition to the ACA, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d) repealed the Sustainable Growth Rate formula used to calculate Medicare payment updates for physicians providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. In its place, MACRA introduced the Quality Payment Program (\u201cQPP\u201d), which is a value-based program that focuses on quality and outcomes as a metric for physician reimbursement. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released its final rules for the QPP in October 2016. The QPP, which impacts more than 600,000 physicians and other practice-based clinicians, represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement, transitioning from a system that solely rewards volume of care to one that also rewards quality and value of care. The rule may have an impact on our revenue in the future. The program\u2019s increased emphasis on quality and cost of care may encourage physicians to merge practices or seek direct employment with hospitals. In addition, the ACA encourages hospitals and physicians to work collaboratively through shared savings programs as well as other bundled payment initiatives. These shifts could lead to a consolidation of hospital providers into larger delivery networks with increased price negotiation strength resulting in downward pressure on our selling prices. Although we believe that we are well positioned to minimize any such impact on our business, our inability to address the consolidation trend could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere is uncertainty with respect to the impact the U.S. Administration, the executive order, and the attempted legislation may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services, including our products. We believe that substantial uncertainty remains regarding the net effect of the PPACA, or its repeal and potential replacement, on our business, including uncertainty over how benefit plans purchased on exchanges will cover our products, how the expansion or contraction of the Medicaid program will affect access to our products, the effect of risk-sharing payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations and other value-based purchasing programs on coverage for our product, and the effect of the general increase or decrease in federal oversight of healthcare payers. The taxes imposed and the expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry under the PPACA, if unchanged, may result in decreased revenues, lower reimbursements by payers for our products and reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may fail to obtain or maintain foreign regulatory approvals to market our products in other countries.\nWe currently market our products in a small number of foreign countries, and intend to expand our international marketing. Foreign jurisdictions require separate regulatory approvals and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements.\nThe approval procedures vary among countries and may involve requirements for additional testing. Certain of our products require clearance or approval by the FDA. However, such clearance or approval does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval or certification process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or certifications and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any foreign jurisdiction. Furthermore, many foreign jurisdictions operate under socialized medical care, and obtaining reimbursement for our products under that construct may also prove difficult. If we fail to receive necessary approvals, certifications, or reimbursements necessary to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFederal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information may increase our costs and limit our ability to collect and use that information and subject us to liability if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nNumerous federal and state laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, security and confidentiality of personal information, including protected health information and individually identifiable health information. These laws include:\n\u2022provisions of HIPAA that limit how covered entities and business associates may use and disclose protected health information, provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information and impose certain security requirements\u037e\n\u2022HITECH, which strengthened and expanded the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rules, imposed data breach notification obligations, created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions\u037e\n\u2022other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy and security of personal information, including health information, many of which are not preempted by HIPAA\u037e\n\u2022federal and state consumer protection laws\u037e and\n\u2022federal and state laws regulating the conduct of research with human subjects.\nOne relevant state law is the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA is a privacy law that requires certain companies doing business in California to disclose information regarding the collection and use of a consumer\u2019s personal data and to delete a consumer\u2019s data upon request. The Act also permits the imposition of civil penalties and expands existing state security laws by providing a private right of action for consumers in certain circumstances where consumer data is subject to a breach. We are still evaluating whether and how this rule will impact our U.S. operations and /or limit the ways in which we can provide services or use personal data collected while providing services.\nAs part of our business operations, including our medical record keeping, third-party billing and reimbursement and research and development activities, we collect and maintain protected health information in paper and electronic format. Standards related to health information, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, HITECH, state laws, federal or state action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle personal information, including healthcare-related data, and communicate with payers, providers, patients, donors and others, and compliance with these standards could impose significant costs on us or limit our ability to offer services, thereby negatively impacting the business opportunities available to us.\nIf we are alleged not to comply with existing or new laws, rules and regulations related to personal information, we could be subject to litigation and to sanctions that include monetary fines, civil or administrative penalties, civil damage awards or criminal penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology, including our licensed technology. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents. The patent application process can be time consuming and expensive. Our pending patent applications might not result in issued patents. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are comparable or even superior to ours. Although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with some of our officers, employees, consultants and advisors, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements.\nThe failure to obtain and maintain patents or protect our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Whether a patent claim is valid is a complex matter of science, facts and law, and therefore we cannot be certain that, if challenged, our patent claims would be upheld. If any of those patent claims are invalidated, our competitive advantage may be reduced or eliminated.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon our licensed patents, issued patents, pending patent applications or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, uncertain, difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. Further, bringing litigation to enforce our patents subjects us to the potential for counterclaims. Other companies or entities also have commenced, and may again commence, actions seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents and certain related claims. In the event that any of our patent claims are challenged, a court, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), or the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) of the USPTO may invalidate one or more challenged patent claims or determine that the patent is unenforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If the USPTO or the PTAB ultimately cancels or narrows the claim scope of any of our patents through these proceedings, it could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce them against competitors. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in enforcing and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our foreign patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in some countries may be inadequate.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from developing our products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages.\nThird parties could assert that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Whether a product infringes a patent claim or other intellectual property right involves a complex combination of legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Because patent applications may take years to issue, there also may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patent claims that our products or processes infringe. There also may be existing patents or pending patent applications of which we are unaware that our products or processes may inadvertently infringe.\nAny infringement claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patent claims at issue in such a dispute were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from selling any product that is found to infringe those claims unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the asserted patent claims or other intellectual property, or are able to design around the patent claim or claims at issue or other intellectual property. We may be unable to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. A court could also order us to pay compensatory damages for such infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in addition, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us and our customers from making, using, or selling products, and could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial measures. Depending on the nature of the relief ordered by the court, we could become liable for additional damages to third parties. Further, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our trade secrets or other confidential information could be compromised by inadvertent or court-ordered disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets, proprietary or confidential information of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at other medical device, pharmaceutical or tissue companies. We may also hire additional employees who are currently employed at other medical device, pharmaceutical or tissue companies, including our competitors. Additionally, consultants or other independent agents with which we may contract may be or have been in a contractual arrangement with one or more of our competitors. Although no claims are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail to defend such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Any future litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire additional direct sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to market existing or new products, which could severely harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to the Audit Committee Investigation, Consolidated Financial Statements, Internal Controls and Related Matters\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020. If we fail to properly remediate these or any future material weaknesses or deficiencies, further material misstatements in our financial statements could occur and impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements, affect our ability to keep our stock listed on a securities exchange, require significant expenditure of financial and other resources, give rise to litigation against us and otherwise affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to the existence of material weaknesses in such controls and we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to material weaknesses in our control over financial reporting, all as described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d of this Form 10-K. While we continued meaningful remediation efforts during 2020 to address the identified weaknesses, we were not able to fully remediate our material weaknesses in internal controls as of December 31, 2020. In addition, one or more additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting might arise or be identified in the future. We intend to continue our control remediation activities and, in doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management time on compliance-related issues.\nIf our remediation measures are insufficient to address the identified deficiencies, or if additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. Moreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to provide reliable and timely financial reports in the future, our business and reputation may be further harmed. Failures in internal controls may also cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, negatively affect investor confidence in our\nmanagement and the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock, subject us to further regulatory investigations and penalties or shareholder litigation, and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNegative publicity, including publicity relating to or arising from the Restatement, the Audit Committee Investigation, or related matters, has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have been and could continue to be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the Restatement, the results of the Investigation, and related matters. As a result, our customers and others with whom we do business have voiced concerns regarding the effort required to address our accounting and control environment and our ability to be a long-term provider to our customers. Further negative publicity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred significant legal and accounting expenditures as a result of the Restatement and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including being a party to certain litigation relating to the Restatement. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Item 8 -- Note 14, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d for additional information. As a result of the Restatement, we may continue to be at risk for further government investigations, shareholder litigation, and additional accounting and legal fees in connection therewith, as well as loss of investor confidence in us, and a negative impact on our stock price.\nWe are currently, in the past have been, and in the future may be, subject to substantial litigation and ongoing investigations that could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert management\u2019s attention, and result in harm to our business.\nWe are exposed to potential liabilities and reputational risk associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. For example, we are party to a securities class action lawsuit alleging, among other things, violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Item 8 -- Note 14, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding proceedings that we believe may be material to the Company as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K. We may be subject to additional lawsuits, including class action or securities derivative lawsuits, and further government investigations as well as incur additional legal fees and may face negative impacts to our stock price and reputation. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify and advance expenses to certain individuals involved in certain of these proceedings.\nAny adverse judgment in or settlement of any pending or any future litigation could result in significant payments, fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Such payments, damages or settlement costs, if any, related to these matters could be in excess of our insurance coverage. The amount of time that is required to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and any litigation or claims against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operation of our business, and materially harm our reputation.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.\nOn July 2, 2020, the Company borrowed an aggregate of $50 million and obtained an additional committed but undrawn $25 million facility (the \u201cHayfin Loan Agreement\u201d). See Item 8, Note 8, \u201cLong-Term Debt.\u201d\nOur substantial outstanding debt may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or may adversely affect the terms on which such additional funds may be available. Additionally, a default under certain other indebtedness constitutes an event of default under the Hayfin Loan Agreement. Consequently, the effects of a default under other debt may be amplified by the lender exercising the remedies available to them in the Hayfin Loan Agreement for events of default, including foreclosure on the collateral securing our obligations and the declaration that all amounts outstanding under the Hayfin Loan Agreement are immediately due and payable. The limitations on our ability to access additional borrowing and the potential effects of a cross-default under the Hayfin Loan Agreement may limit our liquidity and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Hayfin Loan Agreement, and the Company\u2019s obligation to make debt payments under the Hayfin Loan Agreement, limit our operating and financial flexibility and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Hayfin Loan Agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions and covenants. For example, the Hayfin Loan Agreement contains (a) certain covenants that impose certain reporting and/or performance obligations on the Company and its subsidiaries, including (i) a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Hayfin Loan Agreement) of 5.0x through the quarter ended December 31, 2020, stepping down to 4.5x through the quarter ending June 30, 2021 and to 4.0x thereafter until maturity at June 30, 2025, in each case tested quarterly; and (ii) Minimum Liquidity (as defined in the Hayfin Loan Agreement) of $10 million, an at-all-times covenant tested monthly and (b) certain negative covenants that generally limit, subject to various exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries from taking certain actions, including, without limitation, incurring indebtedness (including with respect to drawdowns under the delayed draw term loan (the \u201cDD TL\u201d) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio (pro forma for such drawdowns) exceeds 3.5x), making investments, incurring liens, paying dividends and engaging in mergers and consolidations, sale and leaseback transactions and asset dispositions.\nA breach of a financial covenant in the Hayfin Loan Agreement would result in an event of default that would trigger the lenders\u2019 remedies, including the right to accelerate the entire principal balance of the loan under the Hayfin Loan Agreement. There can be no assurances that we will be able to repay all such amounts or be able to find alternative financing in case of such or other event of a default. Even if alternative financing is available in an event of a default under the Hayfin Loan Agreement, it may be on unfavorable terms, and the interest rate charged on any new borrowings could be substantially higher than the interest rate under the Hayfin Loan Agreement, thus adversely affecting our cash flows, liquidity, and results of operations. Acceleration of the repayment of the loan pursuant to the terms of the Hayfin Loan Agreement, in combination with the Company\u2019s current commitments and contingent liabilities, could also cast doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur variable rate indebtedness under the Hayfin Loan Agreement subjects us to interest rate risk, which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBorrowings under the Hayfin Loan Agreement bear interest at a per annum rate equal to London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), subject to a \u201cfloor\u201d of 1.5%, plus a margin ranging from 6.0% to 6.75% based on our Total Net Leverage Ratio as defined in the Hayfin Loan Agreement. As a result, we are exposed to interest rate risk, which we do not hedge. If LIBOR rises, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Hayfin Loan Agreement will increase. Therefore, an increase in LIBOR will increase our interest payment obligations under the Hayfin Loan Agreement and have a negative effect on our cash flows and liquidity, and could have a negative effect on our ability to make payments due under the Hayfin Loan Agreement.\nEW Healthcare Partners and its interests may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nOn July 2, 2020, we issued 90,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to an affiliate of EW Healthcare Partners (\u201cEW Healthcare Partners\u201d) pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, EW Healthcare Partners and their affiliates own 90% of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock which would result, upon conversion into shares of Common Stock, in an ownership interest of approximately 17.2% of our Common Stock (calculated on the basis set forth under Item 12, \u201cSecurity Ownership Of Certain Beneficial Owners And Management\u201d below). Also, for as long as EW Healthcare Partners and its affiliates collectively hold at least (i) 10% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock (calculated on an as converted basis), EW Healthcare Partners has the right to designate two directors to our Board and (ii) 5% (but less than 10%) of the outstanding shares of our outstanding Common Stock (calculated on an as converted basis), EW Healthcare Partners has the right to designate one individual to serve on our Board. Such individuals will initially be preferred directors and therefore not subject to election by the holders of Common Stock. At the closing of the Preferred Stock Transaction, EW Healthcare Partners designated Martin P. Sutter and William A. Hawkins, III to serve on our board as preferred directors, and they were appointed to our Board on July 2, 2020. The interests of EW Healthcare Partners may conflict with those of our other shareholders, and EW Healthcare Partners may seek to influence, and may be able to influence, us through its director designation rights and its share ownership.\nHolders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of, our common shareholders.\nHolders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of 4.0% per annum until June 30, 2021 and 6.0% per annum thereafter, in each case compounding quarterly in arrears. The dividends are payable quarterly in whole or in part, in cash. However, the Company may, at its option, elect not to pay any such dividend in cash and instead to accrue the amount of such dividend. The payment of regular dividends in cash to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. If we elect to accrue the dividends in lieu of paying them in cash, holders of\nCommon Stock could effectively be diluted because such accrual of dividends will increase the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock would then be convertible. Our obligations to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to our Common Stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up, and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, holders of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock (subject to adjustment), plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. This amount will be payable prior to any distribution of our available assets to the holders of our Common Stock.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock generally are entitled to vote together as a single class with the holders of the shares of Common Stock, on an as converted basis, on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of our Common Stock subject to certain limitations on their voting rights contained in the related Articles of Amendment. Additionally, certain matters will require the approval of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, including the following actions:\n\u2022any changes to the rights, preferences, or privileges of the Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u2022amendments or restatements of any organizational document of the Company or its subsidiaries in a manner that materially, adversely, and disproportionately affects the rights, preferences, and privileges of the Series B Preferred Stock as compared to our Common Stock;\n\u2022the authorization or creation of any class or series of senior or parity equity securities;\n\u2022the declaration of any dividends or any other distributions, or the repurchase or redemption, of any equity securities of the Company ranking junior to or on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock (subject to certain exceptions);\n\u2022prior to January 2, 2023, the sale, transfer, or other disposition of any assets, business, or operations for $25 million or more (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business), or the purchase or acquisition of any assets, business, or operations for $75 million or more;\n\u2022prior to January 2, 2023, the merger or consolidation of the Company unless either (x) the surviving company will have no class of equity securities ranking superior to or on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock or (y) the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will receive in connection therewith consideration per share of Series B Preferred Stock valued at 200% or more of the purchase price per share of $1,000;\n\u2022prior to January 2, 2023, commencing a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or other similar law or consenting to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or effectuating any general assignment for the benefit of creditors; and\n\u2022prior to January 2, 2023, entering into any settlement agreement regarding the Company\u2019s securities class action litigation.\nThe interests of our holders of Series B Preferred Stock and our Common Stock may conflict in certain circumstances, and these provisions may constrain the Company from taking certain actions that may be in the best interest of its holders of Common Stock.\nThe conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock is subject to anti-dilution adjustments in the event that the Company sells or issues Common Stock to any third-party investor at any time prior to July 2, 2022 at a price that is less than $3.85 per share of Common Stock (although such adjustments cannot result in a conversion price for the Series B Preferred Stock of less than $3.47). Additionally, as long as EW Healthcare Partners holds at least 10% of our outstanding Common Stock (calculated on an as converted basis), it has certain preemptive rights to participate in offerings of Common Stock to any person, subject to customary exceptions.\nFurthermore, in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock will have certain redemption rights, which, if exercised, could require us to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for cash at the original purchase price of Series B Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. Any required repurchase of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.\nThe preferential rights of the Series B Preferred Stock could also result in divergent interests between the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and our common shareholders.\nSee Item 8, Note 10, \u201cEquity\u201d for more information regarding our Series B Preferred Stock.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of our Common Stock, and any such conversion may dilute the value of our Common Stock.\nHolders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock have the right, at their option, to convert each share of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock, except that no holder may convert its shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock if such conversion would result in such holder and its affiliates holding more than 19.9% of the aggregate voting power of our Common Stock or beneficially owning in excess of 19.9% of our then-outstanding shares of Common Stock. Additionally, each share of Series B Preferred Stock (including any accrued and unpaid dividends) will automatically convert into shares of our Common Stock at any time after July 2, 2023, provided that our Common Stock has traded at 200% or more of the then conversion price (i) for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days preceding, and (ii) as of the close of trading on the date immediately prior to conversion. The conversion of Series B Preferred Stock may significantly dilute our common shareholders and adversely affect both our net income per share of Common Stock and the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe price of our Common Stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price of our Common Stock, like that of the securities of many other healthcare companies that are engaged in research, development, and commercialization, has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our Common Stock will fluctuate in the future. The market price of our Common Stock could be impacted by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022Our prior delisting from Nasdaq, and then subsequent re-listing on Nasdaq;\n\u2022Fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies or of the markets generally;\n\u2022Our ability to successfully launch, market and earn significant revenue from our products;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain additional financing to support our continuing operations;\n\u2022Disclosure of the details and results of regulatory applications and proceedings;\n\u2022Developments in and disclosure or publicity regarding existing or new litigation or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022Changes in government regulations or our failure to comply with any such regulations;\n\u2022Additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022Our investments in research and development or other corporate resources;\n\u2022Announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022Developments in the patents or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us or our competitors;\n\u2022The timing of new product introductions;\n\u2022Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including any restatements of previously reported results;\n\u2022Our ability to effectively and consistently manufacture our products and avoid costs associated with the recall of defective or potentially defective products;\n\u2022Our ability and the ability of our distribution partners to market and sell our products;\n\u2022Changes in reimbursement for our products or the price for our products to our customers;\n\u2022Removal of our products from the FSS, or changes in how government accounts purchase products such as ours or in the price for our products to government accounts;\n\u2022Activities of market participants and investors, including analysts and MiMedx shareholders;\n\u2022Material amounts of short-selling of our Common Stock; and\n\u2022The other risks detailed in this Item 1A.\nPrice volatility or a decrease in the market price of our Common Stock could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital, liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurities analysts may elect not to report on our common stock or may issue negative reports that adversely affect the stock price.\nWe have conducted extensive investor relations outreach to the investment analysts community with the goal of attracting analyst coverage. However, at this time, only one securities analyst provides coverage on us, and we compensate that analyst\u2019s firm. There can be no assurance that any other analysts will cover our stock or, if they do, that they will continue to report on our common stock or that additional analysts will initiate reporting on our common stock.\nIf we fail to attract the coverage or securities analysts, or if securities analysts discontinue covering our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the actual and potential market price of our common stock. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry participants, industry analysts or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more analysts elect to cover us and then downgrade the stock, the stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nFluctuations in revenue or results of operations could cause additional volatility in our stock price.\nAny unanticipated shortfall in our revenue in any fiscal quarter could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in that quarter. The effect on our net income of such a shortfall could be exacerbated by the relatively fixed nature of most of our costs, which primarily include personnel costs as well as facilities costs. These fluctuations could cause the trading price of our stock to be negatively affected. Our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock.\nHolders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to contractually-determined dividends before holders of our Common Stock. See Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of, our common shareholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock. We currently expect to use available funds and any future earnings to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock; in the development, operation and expansion of our business; to repay debt; and, to the extent authorized by our Board, repurchasing our Common Stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be an investor\u2019s only source of potential gain from our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\nCertain provisions of Florida law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to shareholders, which could affect our share price adversely and prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management.\nThe Florida Business Corporation Act (the \u201cFBCA\u201d) includes several provisions applicable to the Company that may discourage potential acquirors. Such provisions include provisions that:\n\u2022allow directors to take other stakeholders into account in discharging their duties;\n\u2022a requirement that certain transactions with a shareholder of 10% or more ownership must be approved by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the other shareholders unless approved by a majority of the disinterested directors or certain fair price requirements are met; and\n\u2022voting rights acquired by a shareholder at ownership levels at or above one-fifth, one-third and a majority of voting power are denied unless authorized by the Board prior to such acquisition or by a majority of the other shareholders (excluding interested shares (as defined in the FBCA)).\nAdditionally, our organizational documents contain provisions:\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock\u037e\n\u2022restricting persons who may call shareholder meetings\u037e\n\u2022providing for a classified Board\u037e\n\u2022permitting shareholders to remove directors only \u201cfor cause\u201d and only by super-majority vote\u037e and\n\u2022providing the Board with the exclusive right to fill vacancies and to fix the number of directors.\nThese provisions of Florida law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could negatively affect our share price, prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management, prohibit or delay mergers or other takeovers or changes of control of the Company and discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 13878, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MDXG"}
