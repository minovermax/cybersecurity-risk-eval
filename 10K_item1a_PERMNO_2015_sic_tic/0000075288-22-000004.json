{"cik": "75288", "company": "OXFORD INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below highlight some of the factors that could materially affect our operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, prospects and/or operating results may be adversely affected. These are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we currently consider immaterial or are not presently known to us may also adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Industry and Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has created tremendous uncertainty in the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains and has had an adverse impact on our business, revenues and results of operations. In Fiscal 2020, we experienced a net sales decline of 33% from Fiscal 2019 and incurred a net loss of $96 million.\nAt various points during Fiscal 2020, all of our stores and restaurants were closed temporarily, as were all of the stores operated by our wholesale customers. Even after reopening, these physical locations were impacted by state and local government restrictions on occupancy levels, indoor dining and health and safety measures, which negatively impacted customer traffic to our locations.\nThe continued operation of our stores and restaurants, as well as many of our business activities, is dependent on, among other things, our personnel who work at these and other designated locations. In the event that an employee tests positive for COVID-19, we have had to, and may in the future have to, temporarily close one or more stores, restaurants, offices or distribution centers for cleaning and/or due to the unavailability of impacted employees, which could negatively impact our operations.\nWe also rely on suppliers outside of the United States to manufacture our products. As a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain the spread of the virus, our third party suppliers, who are concentrated in Asia, have been, and may in the future be, impacted by materials, capacity, capability or labor constraints. The failure to timely deliver products to us in accordance with our specifications negatively impacts our inventory levels and our ability to have fresh, in-season product available for sale, which may adversely impact our revenues. In addition, we engage freight forwarders, logistics providers and third party shipping vendors to deliver products to us, our retail locations and/or our customers. Service delays or disruptions, restrictions on services available to us or price increases imposed by these vendors due to increased demand or operational challenges has and will continue to exacerbate these challenges, which could also result in lost sales, returns, requests for refunds, cancellation of orders or lost sales, any or all of which could harm our reputation and relationships with our customers.\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the duration, severity and sustained geographic spread of the pandemic, additional waves of increased infections, the virulence and spread of different strains of the virus, and the extent to which associated prevention, containment, remediation and treatment efforts, including global vaccination programs and vaccine acceptance, are successful.\nFurther, even after containment of the virus, any prolonged reduction in consumer traffic, consumer willingness to visit malls, shopping centers or domestic resort areas or levels of consumer discretionary spending would result in a further loss of revenues. Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the other risk factors discussed in this report. Although we did see a rebound in consumer spending and customer traffic to our physical locations during Fiscal 2021, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nOur business and financial condition are heavily influenced by general economic and market conditions which are outside of our control.\nWe are a consumer products company and are highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending and retail traffic patterns, particularly in the United States. The demand for apparel products changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change and may be significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending patterns. These trends may be influenced by employment levels; recessions; increases in inflation and interest rates; fuel and energy costs; tax rates; personal debt levels; savings rates; stock market and housing market volatility; shifting social ideology; and general uncertainty about the future. The factors impacting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending patterns are outside of our control and difficult to predict, and, often, the apparel industry experiences longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy. In addition, as the growth in our direct to consumer operations continues to outpace our other operations, we may have increased exposure to certain risks associated with a volatile and unpredictable economic environment. Any decline in consumer confidence or change in discretionary consumer spending patterns could reduce our sales, increase our inventory levels, result in more promotional activities and/or lower our gross margins, any or all of which may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with significant pricing pressures and heightened customer expectations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry in which the principal competitive factors are the reputation, value and image of brand names; design of differentiated, innovative or otherwise compelling product; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. The highly competitive apparel industry is characterized by low barriers to entry, with new competition entering the marketplace regularly. There are numerous domestic and foreign apparel designers, distributors, importers, licensors and retailers, some of whom are also our customers. Some of these companies may be significantly larger or more diversified than us and/or have significantly greater financial resources than we do.\nCompetition in the apparel industry is particularly enhanced in the digital marketplace for our rapidly growing e-commerce businesses, where there are new entrants in the market, greater pricing pressure and heightened customer expectations and competitive pressure related to, among other things, customer engagement, delivery speed, shipping charges and return privileges. In addition, fast fashion, value fashion and off-price retailers have shifted customer expectations of pricing for well-known brands and have contributed to additional promotional pressure in recent years.\nThese and other competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales, increased costs, lower prices for our products and/or decreased margins.\nFailure to anticipate and adapt to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences could harm our reputation and financial performance.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and presenting appealing products for consumers when and where they seek it. Although certain of our products carry over from season to season, the apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer expectations, as evidenced by the recent acceleration of casualization trends in the apparel industry. The increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication, as well as the attempted replication of our products by competitors, presents emerging challenges for our business. The apparel industry is also impacted by changing consumer preferences regarding spending categories generally, including shifts\naway from traditional consumer product spending and towards \u201cexperiential\u201d spending and sustainable products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with evolving consumer preferences and changes in consumer demographics. Any failure on our part to develop and market appealing products could harm the reputation and desirability of our brands and products and/or result in weakened financial performance.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers, vendors and wholesale customers may be affected by changes in weather patterns, natural or man-made disasters, public health crises, war, terrorism or other catastrophes.\nOur sales volume and operations and the operations of third parties on whom we rely, including our suppliers, vendors, licensees and wholesale customers, may be adversely affected by unseasonable or severe weather conditions, natural or man-made disasters, public health crises, war, terrorist attacks, including heightened security measures and responsive military actions, or other catastrophes which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations. Our business may also be adversely affected by instability, disruption or destruction, regardless of cause. These events may result in closures of our retail stores, restaurants, offices or distribution centers and/or declines in consumer traffic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Because of the seasonality of our business, the concentration of a significant proportion of our retail stores and wholesale customers in certain geographic regions, including a resort and/or coastal focus for most of our lifestyle brands, and the concentration of our sourcing and distribution center operations, the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the financial and economic sanctions and other measures imposed by the European Union, the U.S., and other countries and organizations in response is creating, and may continue to create, market disruption and volatility and instability in the geopolitical environment. The extent to which this conflict escalates to other countries and the resulting impact on the global market, including consumer confidence and spending in the United States, remains uncertain. We cannot predict if this situation will result in broader economic and security concerns or in material implications for our business. This event could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Related to our Business Strategy and Operations\nFailure to maintain the reputation or value of our brands could harm our business operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on the reputation and value of our brand names. The value of our brands could be diminished by actions taken by us or by our licensees, wholesale customers or others who have an interest in our brands. Actions that could cause harm to our brands include failing to respond to emerging fashion trends or meet consumer quality expectations; selling products bearing our brands through distribution channels that are inconsistent with customer expectations; becoming overly promotional; or setting up consumer expectations for promotional activity for our products. In addition, social media is a critical marketing and customer acquisition strategy in today\u2019s technology-driven retail environment, and the value of our brands could be adversely affected if we do not effectively communicate our brand message through social media vehicles, including with respect to our social responsibility and sustainability initiatives. The significant concentration in our portfolio heightens the risks we face if one of our larger brands is adversely impacted by actions we or third parties take with respect to that brand.\nThe improper or detrimental actions of a licensee or wholesale customer, including a third party distributor in an international market, could also significantly impact the perception of our brands. While we enter into comprehensive license and similar collaborative agreements with third party licensees covering product design, product quality, brand standards, sourcing, social compliance, distribution, operations, manufacturing and/or marketing requirements and approvals, there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products or concepts outside of our core apparel products and by the market perception of the third parties with whom we associate. In addition, we cannot always control the marketing and promotion of our products by our wholesale customers, and actions by such parties that adversely affect the appeal of our products could diminish the value or reputation of one or more of our brands and have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margins and business operations.\nThe appeal of our brands may also depend on the perceived success of our environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives and our commitments to operating our business in a socially responsible fashion. ESG risks include increased stakeholder focus on environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal welfare and land use. ESG risks may also include increased pressure to expand our disclosures in these areas, make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. The metrics we disclose may not meet stakeholder expectations and may impact our reputation and the value of our brands, and a failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur inability to execute our direct to consumer and portfolio-level strategies in response to shifts in consumer shopping behavior could adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nOne of our key long-term initiatives over the last several years has been to grow our branded businesses through distribution strategies that allow our consumers to access our brands whenever and wherever they choose to shop. Our ability to anticipate and transform our business in response to the manner in which consumers seek to transact business and access products requires us to introduce new retail, restaurant and other concepts in suitable locations; anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing technology to align with our consumers\u2019 shopping preferences; invest in appropriate digital and other technologies; establish the infrastructure necessary to support growth; maintain brand specific websites and mobile applications that offer the functionality and security customers expect; and effectively enhance our advertising and marketing activities, including our social media presence, to maintain our current customers and attract and introduce new consumers to our brands and offerings.\nEven prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the retail apparel market was evolving very rapidly in ways that are disruptive to traditional fashion retailers. These changes included sustained declines in bricks and mortar retail traffic; entry into the fashion retail space by large e-commerce retailers and others with significant financial resources and enhanced distribution capabilities; increased costs to attract and retain consumers; increased investment in technology and multi-channel distribution strategies by large, traditional bricks and mortar and big box retailers; ongoing emphasis on off-price and fast fashion channels of distribution, in particular those who offer brand label products at clearance; and increased appeal for consumers of products that incorporate sustainable materials and processes in the supply chain and/or otherwise reflect their social or personal values. In response, fashion retailers and competing brands have increasingly offered greater transparency for consumers in product pricing and engaged in increased promotional activities, both online and in-store. These trends accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and are likely to continue to evolve in ways that may not yet be evident.\nIn response to these evolving and rapidly changing trends in consumer shopping behavior, we have made and expect to continue to make significant capital investments in expanding our digital capabilities and technologies in three key areas: mobile technology; digital marketing; and the digital customer experience. Although we experienced significant growth in our e-commerce businesses during both Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, there is no assurance that we will realize a return on these investments or be successful in continuing to grow our e-commerce businesses over the long term.\nAny inability on our part to effectively adapt to rapidly evolving consumer behavioral trends may result in lost sales, increase our costs and/or adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, reputation and credibility.\nWe may be unable to grow our business through organic growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nA key component of our business strategy is organic growth in our brands. Organic growth may be achieved by, among other things, increasing sales in our direct to consumer channels; selling our products in new markets; increasing our market share in existing markets; expanding the demographic appeal of our brands; expanding our margins through product cost reductions, price increases or otherwise; expanding the customer reach of our brands through new and enhanced advertising initiatives; and increasing the product offerings and concepts within our various operating groups, such as the opening of additional Marlin Bars at Tommy Bahama and owned retail stores at Southern Tide and TBBC. Successful growth of our business is also subject to our ability to implement plans for expanding and/or maintaining our\nexisting businesses at satisfactory levels. We may not be successful in achieving suitable organic growth, and our inability to grow our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, investments we make in technology, advertising and infrastructure, retail stores and restaurants, office and distribution center facilities, personnel and elsewhere may not yield the full benefits we anticipate, and sales growth may be outpaced by increases in operating costs, putting downward pressure on our operating margins and adversely affecting our results of operations. If we are unable to increase our revenues organically, we may be required to pursue other strategic initiatives, including reductions in costs and/or acquisitions, in order to grow our business. These initiatives may not be available to us on desirable terms, inhibiting our ability to increase profitability.\nThe acquisition of new businesses is inherently risky, and we cannot be certain that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition.\nGrowth of our business through acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model is a component of our long-term business strategy. The competitive climate for desirable acquisition candidates drives higher market multiples, and we may pay more to consummate an acquisition than the value we ultimately derive from the acquired business. Acquisitions may cause us to incur debt or make dilutive issuances of our equity securities, and may result in certain impairment or amortization charges in our statements of operations. In addition, we may not complete a potential acquisition for a variety of reasons but still incur material, unrecoverable costs in the preliminary stages of evaluating and pursuing an acquisition. Additionally, as a result of acquisitions, we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence.\nIn addition, the benefits of an acquisition may not materialize to the extent or within the time periods anticipated. Integrating acquired businesses is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. The integration process for newly acquired businesses could create a number of challenges and adverse consequences for us associated with the integration of product lines, support functions, employees, sales teams and outsourced manufacturers; employee turnover, including key management and creative personnel of the acquired business and our existing businesses; disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines; maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; operating a business in new geographic territories; diversion of the attention of our management from other areas of our business; and the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses. Furthermore, certain acquisitions may also be structured utilizing contingent consideration based on the acquired business\u2019 post-acquisition results, and the principals from whom we acquired such a business, many of whom may continue to operate the business as our employees, may have differing interests than those of our shareholders because of such arrangements.\nAs the fashion retail environment evolves, our investment criteria for acquisitions has grown to include smaller brands and non-controlling investments in burgeoning brands seeking debt or equity financing. The limited operating history, less experienced management teams and less sophisticated systems, infrastructure and relationships generally associated with such brands may heighten the risks associated with acquisitions generally. Minority investments present additional risks, including the potential disproportionate distraction to our management team relative to the potential financial benefit; the potential for a conflict of interest; the damage to our reputation of associating with a brand which may take actions inconsistent with our values; and the financial risks associated with making an investment in an unproven business model.\nThe divestiture or discontinuation of businesses and product lines could result in unexpected liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may also divest or discontinue businesses, product lines and/or wholesale relationships that do not align with our strategy or provide the returns that we expect or desire, such as our Fiscal 2021 exit of the Lanier Apparel business. Such dispositions and/or discontinuations may result in underutilization of our retained resources if the exited operations are not replaced with new lines of business, either internally or through acquisition. In addition, we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels.\nMany factors, such as economic conditions, fashion trends, consumer preferences, the financial condition of our wholesale customers and weather, make it difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products. In order to meet the expected demand for our products in a cost-effective manner, we make commitments for production several months prior to our receipt of goods and typically without firm commitments from our customers. Depending on the demand for our products, we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered or that we have in our inventory, which may result in inventory markdowns, costs incurred to cancel inventory purchases or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices and through off-price channels. These events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate the timing or extent of demand for our products or if we are unable to access our products when we need them, for example due to a third party manufacturer\u2019s inability to source materials or produce goods in a timely fashion or as a result of delays in the delivery of products to us, issues which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in lost sales, unfilled orders, negatively impacted customer relationships, and diminished brand loyalty, any of which could harm our business. These risks relating to inventory may also escalate as our direct to consumer sales, for which we do not have any advance purchase commitments, continue to increase as a proportion of our consolidated net sales.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing real estate for our retail stores and restaurants.\nWe lease all of our retail store and restaurant locations. Successful operation of our retail stores and restaurants depends, in part, on our ability to identify desirable, brand appropriate locations; the overall ability of the location to attract a consumer base sufficient to make sales volume profitable; our ability to negotiate satisfactory lease terms and employ qualified personnel; and our ability to timely construct and complete any build-out and open the location in accordance with our plans, which could be delayed due to supply chain constraints and/or labor or materials shortages. A decline in the volume of consumer traffic at our retail stores and restaurants, due to economic conditions, shifts in consumer shopping preferences or technology, a decline in the popularity of malls or lifestyle centers in general or at those in which we operate, the closing of anchor stores or other adjacent tenants or otherwise, all of which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, could continue to have a negative impact on our sales, gross margin and results of operations. Our growth may be limited if we are unable to identify new locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level or the local market reception to a new retail store opening is inconsistent with our expectations.\nOur retail store and restaurant leases generally represent long-term financial commitments, with substantial costs at lease inception for a location\u2019s design, leasehold improvements, fixtures and systems installation and recurring fixed costs. On an ongoing basis, we review the financial performance of our retail and restaurant locations in order to determine whether continued operation is appropriate. Even if we determine that it is desirable to exit a particular location, we may be unable to close an underperforming location due to continuous use clauses and/or because negotiating an early termination would be cost prohibitive. In addition, due to the fixed-cost structure associated with these operations, negative cash flows or the closure of a retail store or restaurant could result in impairment of leasehold improvements, impairment of operating lease assets and/or other long-lived assets, severance costs, lease termination costs or the loss of working capital, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. Furthermore, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could force us to close retail stores and/or restaurants in desirable locations.\nFurthermore, a deterioration in the financial condition of shopping center operators or developers could, for example, limit their ability to invest in improvements and finance tenant improvements for us and other retailers and lead consumers to view these locations as less desirable. In addition, if our e-commerce businesses continue to grow, they may do so in part by attracting existing customers, rather than new customers, who choose to purchase products from us online through our websites rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our bricks-and-mortar operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may make use of debt to finance our operations, which could expose us to risks that adversely affect our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur cash requirements vary as a result of the seasonality of our business, investments in our operations and working capital needs. The continued growth of our business depends on our access to sufficient funds. If the need arises in the future to finance expenditures in excess of those supported by our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement, we may need to seek additional funding through debt or equity financing. Our ability to obtain that financing will depend on many factors, including prevailing market conditions, our financial condition and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions. The terms of any such financing or our inability to secure such financing could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategies, and the negative covenants in our debt agreements, now or in the future, may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and/or limit our flexibility in carrying out our business strategy and plans.\nIn addition, we have interest rate risk on indebtedness under our variable rate U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. Our exposure to variable rate indebtedness may increase in the future, based on our debt levels and/or the terms of future financing arrangements. Further, an anticipated increase in the interest rate environment would require us to pay a greater amount towards interest if and when we access capital under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement or other financing arrangements.\nThe loss of one or more of our key wholesale customers, or a significant adverse change in a customer\u2019s financial position, could negatively impact our net sales and profitability.\nWe generate a material percentage of our wholesale sales, which was 20% of our net sales in Fiscal 2021, from a few key customers. In Fiscal 2021, our largest customer represented 4% of our consolidated net sales. Over the last several years, department stores and other large retailers have faced increased competition from online competitors, declining sales and profitability and tightened credit markets, resulting in store closures, bankruptcies and financial restructurings. These challenges were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn. Restructuring of our customers\u2019 operations, continued store closures or increased direct sourcing by customers could negatively impact our net sales and profitability.\nWe also extend credit to most of our key wholesale customers without requiring collateral, which results in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers. A significant adverse change in a customer\u2019s financial position or ability to satisfy its obligations to us could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, in some cases after we have already made product purchase commitments for inventory; require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer\u2019s receivables; or limit our ability to collect amounts related to shipments to that customer. In addition, a decision by one or more of our key wholesale customers to terminate its relationship with us or to reduce its purchases from us or our licensees, whether motivated by competitive considerations, a change in desired product assortment, quality or style issues, financial difficulties, economic conditions or otherwise, could also adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Information Technology\nCybersecurity attacks and/or breaches of information security or privacy could disrupt our operations, cause us to incur additional expenses, expose us to litigation and/or cause us financial harm.\nCybersecurity attacks continue to become increasingly sophisticated, and experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our assets, including confidential information, or disrupt our systems. We collect, use, store and transmit sensitive and confidential personal information of our customers, employees, suppliers and others as an ongoing part of our business operations, and we are regularly subject to attempts by attackers to gain unauthorized access to our networks, systems and data, or to obtain, change or destroy confidential information. In addition, customers may use devices or software that are beyond our control environment to purchase our products, which may provide additional avenues for attackers to gain access to confidential information.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, if an actual or perceived data security breach occurs, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, vandalism, ransomware, human error or otherwise, or if there are perceived vulnerabilities in our systems, the image of our brands and our reputation and credibility could be damaged, and, in some cases, our continued operations may be impaired or restricted. Ongoing and increasing costs to enhance cybersecurity protection and prevent, eliminate or mitigate vulnerabilities and comply with required security or other measures under state, federal and international laws, which may include deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants, are significant. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our operations may be adversely affected by an actual or perceived data security breach. Costs to resolve any litigation or to investigate and remediate any actual or perceived breach could result in significant financial losses and expenses, as well as lost sales. While we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance in an escalating threat environment that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts.\nAs part of our routine operations, we also contract with third party service providers to store, process and transmit personal information of our customers and employees. Although we may contractually require that these providers implement reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur at their location or within their systems. Privacy breaches of confidential information stored or used by our third party service providers or disruptions in their systems may expose us to the same risks as a breach of our own systems, including negative publicity, potential out-of-pocket costs and adverse effects on our business and customer relationships.\nOur operations are reliant on information technology, and any interruption or other failure could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on information technology. This requires us to devote significant financial and employee resources to information technology initiatives and operations. Information systems are used in all stages of our operations and as a method of communication, both internally and with our customers, service providers and suppliers. Many of our information technology solutions are operated and/or maintained by third parties, including our use of cloud-based solutions. Additionally, each of our operating groups uses e-commerce websites, point-of-sale systems, enterprise order management systems, warehouse management systems and wholesale ordering systems to acquire, manage, sell and distribute goods. Our management also relies on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information in order to allocate resources, manage operations and forecast, account for and report our operating results. Service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors, including power outages, consumer traffic levels, computer viruses, sabotage, hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties, human error, disasters or failures to properly install, upgrade, integrate, protect, repair or maintain our various systems, networks and e-commerce websites. All of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe similarly rely on the information technology resources of third parties, including logistics providers. In February 2022, Expeditors International of Washington Inc. announced that it was the subject of a targeted cyberattack, which resulted in a shutdown of its ability to conduct operations, resulting in a delay in the delivery of our products. In light of the current geopolitical environment, there are heightened risks that our information technology systems, as well as those of third parties on whom we rely in order to conduct our operations, could be compromised by threat actors.\nReliance on outdated technology or failure to upgrade our information technology systems and capabilities could impair the efficient operation of our business and our ability to compete.\nAny failure to timely upgrade our technology systems and capabilities may impair our ability to market, sell and deliver products to our customers, efficiently conduct our operations, facilitate customer engagement in today\u2019s digital marketplace and/or meet the needs of our management. We regularly evaluate upgrades or enhancements to our information systems to more efficiently and competitively operate our businesses, including periodic upgrades to digital commerce and marketing, warehouse management, guest relations, omnichannel and/or enterprise order management systems in our businesses. Digital commerce and marketing have continued to increase in importance to our business, and we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital in the digital strategies, systems, expertise and\ncapabilities necessary for us to compete effectively in this arena. Upgrades to our systems may be expensive undertakings, may not be successful and/or could be abandoned, as we did in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2020 with a Tommy Bahama information technology project. We may also experience difficulties during the implementation, upgrade or subsequent operation of our systems, including the risk of introducing cybersecurity vulnerabilities into our systems or the loss of certain functionality, information from our legacy systems and/or efficient interfaces with third party and continuing systems. Temporary processes or solutions, including manual operations, which may be required to be instituted in the short term could also significantly increase the risk of loss or corruption of data and information.\nRemote work arrangements could inhibit our ability to effectively operate our business and result in enhanced cybersecurity risks.\nThe majority of our corporate and office employees continue to perform some or all of their duties on a remote basis, and we anticipate continuing to implement remote work arrangements for a substantial portion of our employees in the future. If remote work arrangements negatively impact the performance or management of our employees, whether as a result of technological challenges, unsuitable work environments or other limitations, our ability to carry out key functions and successfully manage our operations could be compromised. In addition, remote work arrangements could exacerbate our existing cybersecurity and privacy risks, including by introducing vulnerabilities in our systems due to the use of laptops, mobile devices and remote work environments. Cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents resulting from a failure to manage these risks could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Sourcing and Distribution Strategies\nOur reliance on third party producers in foreign countries to meet our production demands exposes us to risks that could disrupt our supply chain, increase our costs and negatively impact our operations.\nWe source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third party producers located in foreign countries. Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers, we do not have long-term supply contracts but instead conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Therefore, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We also depend on the ability of these third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity, and in some cases, the products we purchase and the raw materials that are used in our products are available only from one source or a limited number of sources. Although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of available production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. In addition, we may experience disruptions in our supply chain as we continue to diversify the jurisdictions from which we source products. Any such difficulties may impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, increase our costs, negatively impact our customer relationships and result in lower net sales and profits.\nOur operations are dependent on the global supply chain, and the impact of supply chain constraints may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nStarting in the latter part of Fiscal 2020 and continuing into the early part of Fiscal 2022, our operations have been, and are expected to be, impacted by supply chain constraints, labor shortages and raw material shortages, resulting in increased costs for raw materials, longer lead times, port congestion and increased freight costs caused, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic, increased consumer demand, the uncertain economic environment, and other macroeconomic trends. As a result of these factors within the global supply chain, our gross margins were negatively impacted during Fiscal 2021. We also rely on logistics providers to transport our products to our distribution centers in the United States. During Fiscal 2021, international shipping to the United States was disrupted and delayed. Continued or additional delays in shipping may cause us to have to use more expensive air freight or other more costly methods to ship our products. Failure to adequately produce and timely ship our products to customers could lead to increased costs and lost sales, negatively impact our relationships with customers, and adversely impact our brand reputation.\nAny disruption or failure in our primary distribution facilities may materially adversely affect our business or operations.\nWe rely on our primary distribution facilities in order to support our direct to consumer and wholesale operations, meet customer fulfillment expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies. We may have a greater risk than our peers due to the concentration of our distribution facilities, as substantially all of our products for each operating group are distributed through one or two principal distribution centers. The primary distribution facilities that we operate are as follows: a distribution center in Auburn, Washington dedicated to our Tommy Bahama products; a distribution center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania dedicated to our Lilly Pulitzer products; and a distribution center in Lyons, Georgia primarily dedicated to supporting all of our brands. Although we continue to enhance our enterprise order management capabilities to deliver products from other physical locations, our ability to effectively support our direct to consumer and wholesale operations, meet customer expectations, manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities, each of which manages the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of finished goods.\nIf any of our primary distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including as a result of natural or man-made disasters, pandemics or epidemics (including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), human error, or cybersecurity attacks or computer viruses, or if we are unable to receive or ship the goods in a distribution center, as a result of a technology failure, labor shortages or otherwise, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, a reduction in sales, higher costs, insufficient inventory at our retail stores to meet consumer expectations and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products. In addition, for the distribution facilities that we operate, there are substantial fixed costs associated with these large, highly automated distribution centers, and we could experience reduced operating and cost efficiencies during periods of economic weakness. Any disruption to our distribution facilities or in their efficient operation could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships.\nFluctuations and volatility in the cost and availability of raw materials, labor and freight may materially increase our costs.\nWe and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices. The principal fabrics used in our business are cotton, linens, wools, silk, other natural fibers, synthetics and blends of these materials. The prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them. The cost of the materials and components that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other costs, can fluctuate. We historically have not entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices. In Fiscal 2021 and the early part of Fiscal 2022, the costs of raw materials, including cotton and oil, have rapidly increased, and we expect this inflationary pressure to continue during Fiscal 2022. These price increases could continue in future years.\nEmployment costs represented more than 40% of our consolidated SG&A in Fiscal 2021, and we have seen increases in the cost of labor in our retail, restaurant and distribution center operations as well as at many of our suppliers in recent years, which intensified during Fiscal 2021. Employment costs are affected by labor markets, as well as various federal, state and foreign laws governing matters such as minimum wage rates, overtime compensation and other requirements. In addition, in recent years, there has been significant political pressure and legislative action to increase the minimum wage rate in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have also experienced increases in freight costs and distribution and logistics functions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors and may continue to see such cost and capacity pressures, including as a result of the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, which is expected to impact energy costs. Although we attempt to mitigate the effect of increases in our cost of goods sold, labor costs, occupancy costs, other operational costs and SG&A items through sourcing initiatives and by selectively increasing the prices of our products, we may be unable to fully pass on these costs to our customers, and material increases in our costs may reduce the profitability of our operations and/or adversely impact our results of operations.\nLabor-related matters, including labor disputes, may adversely affect our operations.\nWe may be adversely affected as a result of labor disputes in our own operations or in those of third parties with whom we work. Our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner, and our new retail store and restaurant growth is dependent on timely construction of our locations. While we are not subject to any organized labor agreements and have historically enjoyed good employee relations, there can be no assurance that we will not experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future with our non-unionized employees. In addition, potential labor disputes at independent factories where our goods are produced, shipping ports or transportation carriers create risks for our business, particularly if a dispute results in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing, shipping and selling seasons. Further, we plan our inventory purchases and forecasts based on the anticipated timing of retail store and restaurant openings, which could be delayed as a result of a number of factors, including labor disputes among contractors engaged to construct our locations or within government licensing or permitting offices or the unavailability of qualified contractors due to labor shortages. Any potential labor dispute, either in our own operations or in those of third parties on whom we rely, could materially affect our costs, decrease our sales, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively affect our operations.\nOur international operations, including foreign sourcing, result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to certain currency exchange risks in conducting business outside of the United States. The substantial majority of our product purchases are from foreign vendors and are denominated in U.S. dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future, then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase and we may be unable to pass this increase on to customers, which would negatively impact our margins. However, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product, the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by competitors that pay for goods in local currencies, and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies in which we have sales could also result in lower levels of sales and earnings reported in our consolidated statements of operations and lower gross margins. Additionally, currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance.\nOur geographic concentration of retail stores, restaurants and wholesale customers exposes us to certain regional risks.\nOur operations and retail and restaurant locations are heavily concentrated in the United States and certain geographic areas within the United States, including Florida, California, Texas and Hawaii for our Tommy Bahama operations; Florida for our Lilly Pulitzer operations; and Florida for our Southern Tide operations, where six of seven total retail stores are anticipated to be open by the end of Fiscal 2022. Additionally, the wholesale sales for each of Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide are also geographically concentrated, including in geographic areas where we have concentrations of our own retail store locations. Due to these concentrations, as well as our brands\u2019 association with the resort lifestyle and destinations, we have heightened exposure to factors that impact these regions, including general economic conditions, weather patterns, natural disasters, public health crises, changing demographics and other factors.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Tax and Financial Reporting Matters\nOur business is subject to various federal, foreign, state and local laws and regulations, and the costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our costs or operations.\nWe are subject to stringent standards, laws and other regulations, including those relating to health, product performance and safety, labor, employment, privacy and data security, anti-bribery, consumer protection, taxation, customs, logistics and other operational matters. These laws and regulations, in the United States and abroad, are complex and often vary widely by jurisdiction, making it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently or will in the future be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations in all the states and countries in which we operate. In\naddition to the local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, we are subject to certain anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If any of our international operations, or our employees or agents, violates such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nWe may be required to make significant expenditures and devote significant time and management resources to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, and a violation of applicable laws and regulations by us, or any of our suppliers or licensees, may restrict our ability to import products, require a recall of our products, lead to fines or otherwise increase our costs, negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or materially limit our ability to operate our business. In addition, regardless of whether any allegations of violations of the laws and regulations governing our business are valid or whether we ultimately become liable, we may be materially affected by negative publicity as a result of such allegations.\nIn November 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) issued an emergency temporary standard (\u201cETS\u201d) regulation requiring that all large employers, including us, require their employees to be fully vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 weekly. Certain local jurisdictions within the United States imposed similar requirements during Fiscal 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although OSHA withdrew the ETS regulation in January 2022, there can be no assurances that OSHA or state or local agencies will not attempt to impose similar regulations as a result of any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or variants. If any such regulations go into effect on a widescale basis, it is difficult to predict the disruptions we may experience due to employee attrition and increased labor costs, which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment governing our use of individually identifiable data is complex, and compliance with new and modified state, federal and international privacy and security laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 and similar laws being enacted in other states, may require us to modify our operations and/or incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes. In addition, because we process and transmit payment card information, we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard and card brand operating rules, which provide for a comprehensive set of rules relating to the retention and/or transmission of payment card information. If we do not comply with the applicable standards, we may be subject to fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nChanges in international trade regulation could increase our costs and disrupt our supply chain.\nDue to our international sourcing activities, we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate. These risks include imposition of additional or new antidumping, countervailing or other duties, tariffs, taxes or quota restrictions; government-imposed restrictions as a result of public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; changes in customs procedures for importing apparel products; restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries; and the issuance of sanctions and trade orders. Any of these factors may disrupt our supply chain, and we may be unable to offset any associated cost increases by shifting production to suitable manufacturers in other jurisdictions in a timely manner or at acceptable prices, and future regulatory actions or changes in international trade regulation may provide our competitors with a material advantage over us or render our products less desirable in the marketplace.\nThere have been periodic discussions, commentary and governmental actions regarding potentially significant changes to the United States\u2019 trade policies and tariffs regarding China, from which we sourced 38% of our products in Fiscal 2021. It is unclear what changes might be considered or implemented, particularly in the current geopolitical environment, and what response to any such changes may be taken by other governments. Significant tariffs or other restrictions placed on Chinese imports and any related countermeasures that are taken by China could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has increasingly been enforcing laws related to the prevention of forced labor in importers\u2019 supply chains, with a focus on commodities such as cotton, which is prevalent in our products. Any actions taken by customs officials to block products suspected of being manufactured with forced labor, whether or not accurate, could materially disrupt our supply chain, operations and financial results.\nAny violation or perceived violation of our codes of conduct or environmental and social compliance programs, including by our manufacturers or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our brands.\nWe have a robust legal and social compliance program, including codes of conduct and vendor compliance standards. The reputation of our brands could be harmed if we or our third party manufacturers and vendors, substantially all of which are located outside the United States, fail to meet appropriate product safety, product quality and social compliance standards. Despite our efforts, we cannot ensure that our manufacturers and vendors will at all times conduct their operations in accordance with ethical practices or that the products we purchase will always meet our safety and quality control standards, and any failure to do so could disrupt our supply chain and adversely affect our business operations.\nIn Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, the U.S. Government issued withhold release orders in response to concerns regarding forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (the \u201cXUAR\u201d) of China. The XUAR is the source of significant amounts of cotton. Although we do not knowingly source any products from the XUAR and we have no known involvement with China\u2019s Xinjiang Production and Construction Corporation (\u201cXPCC\u201d) or its affiliates, we could be subject to penalties, fines or sanctions if any of the factories from which we purchase goods is found or suspected to have dealings, directly or indirectly, with XPCC or entities with which it may be affiliated. Also, while we have diversified the jurisdictions from which we source products, our manufacturing operations remain concentrated in China, cotton is among the principal raw materials used in many of our goods and even the cotton used in our products manufactured outside of China largely originated in Chinese fabric mills. The presence or perception of forced labor in our supply chain in spite of our efforts to ensure that our third party manufacturers and vendors meet human rights and labor standards could result in adverse impacts on our business, including the detention of goods at U.S. points of entry, challenges in identifying replacement vendors and harm to our reputation.\nFurthermore, consumers are increasingly attuned to the environmental and social impact of the products they purchase and companies with which they do business. A failure to effectively communicate our core principles with our customers and investors or respond to concerns raised with respect to our social responsibility and sustainability initiatives, including through our social media channels, could result in a negative public perception of our brands and products and negatively impact our business.\nAs a multi-national apparel company, we may experience fluctuations in our tax liabilities and effective tax rate.\nAs a multi-national apparel company, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We record our income tax liability based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations, which requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation. In addition, we may from time to time modify our operations in an effort to minimize our consolidated income tax expense. Our effective income tax rate in any particular period or in future periods may be affected by a number of factors, including a shift in the mix of revenues, income and/or losses among domestic and international sources during a year or over a period of years; changes in tax laws and regulations and/or international tax treaties; the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions; the difference between the income tax deduction and the previously recognized income tax benefit related to the vesting of equity-based compensation awards; and the resolution of uncertain tax positions, any of which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nFurther, changes to U.S. and foreign tax laws and compliance with new tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense, cash flows and operations. There have been recent proposals to, among other things, increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate, increase the tax rate on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries and impose a minimum tax on worldwide book income, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense and cash flows. In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has published action plans that, if adopted by countries where we do business, could materially impact our tax obligations in those countries.\nImpairment charges for goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe carrying values of our goodwill and long-lived assets, including those recorded in connection with our acquisition of a business or our bricks and mortar operations, are subject to periodic impairment testing. Impairment\ntesting of goodwill and long-lived assets requires us to make estimates about future performance and cash flows that are inherently uncertain and can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic conditions, income tax rates, our results of operations and competitive conditions in the industry. For example, in Fiscal 2020, we recognized $60 million of non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, which reflected the impact of COVID-19 on the operations, plans and strategy of the Southern Tide business. Future impairment charges may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain liquor licenses or comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant operations.\nThe restaurant industry requires compliance with a variety of federal, state and local regulations. In particular, all of our Tommy Bahama restaurants and Marlin Bars serve alcohol and, therefore, maintain liquor licenses, which are becoming increasingly more expensive to obtain in various jurisdictions. Our ability to maintain our liquor licenses and other permits depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The loss of a liquor license or other critical permits would adversely affect the profitability of that restaurant. Additionally, as a participant in the restaurant industry, we face risks related to food quality, food-borne illness, injury, health inspection scores and labor relations. The negative impact of adverse publicity relating to allegations of actual or perceived violations at one of our restaurants may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of our other restaurants, as well as the image of the Tommy Bahama brand as a whole.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business depends on our senior management and other key personnel, and failure to successfully attract, retain and implement succession of our senior management and key personnel or to attract, develop and retain personnel to fulfill other critical functions may have an adverse effect on our operations and ability to execute our strategies.\nOur senior management has substantial experience in the apparel and related industries, with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Thomas C. Chubb III having worked with our company for more than 30 years, including in various executive management capacities. Our success depends on disciplined execution at all levels of our organization, including our senior management, and continued succession planning. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we compete to attract and retain these individuals with other companies that may have greater financial resources than us. While we believe that we have depth within our management team, the unexpected loss of any of our senior management, or the unsuccessful integration of new leadership, could harm our business and financial performance. In addition, we may be unable to retain or recruit qualified personnel in key areas such as product design, sales, marketing (including individuals with key insights into digital and social media marketing strategies), distribution, technology, sourcing and other support functions, which could result in missed sales opportunities and harm to key business relationships.\nIn Fiscal 2021, in particular, the U.S. labor market experienced significant turnover, which has been commonly referred to as the Great Resignation. During Fiscal 2021, we experienced staffing shortages, higher turnover rates and challenges in recruiting and retaining qualified employees at all levels of our organization, which may continue in the future. Our inability or failure to recruit and retain personnel in key functions could adversely impact our business, financial performance, reputation, our ability to keep up with the needs of our customers and overall customer satisfaction.\nIn addition, we must attract, develop, and retain qualified field and distribution center personnel in order to operate our business efficiently. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels and prevailing wage rates. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, particularly with the current challenges in the labor market, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by consumers and retailers. Substantially all of our consolidated net sales are attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark. Therefore, our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property. We rely on laws in the United States and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. However, we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We have also experienced inherent, expanding challenges with enforcing our intellectual property rights on third party e-commerce websites, especially those based in foreign jurisdictions. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm the reputation of our brands.\nWe devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts. Despite these efforts, we regularly discover products that infringe our proprietary rights or that otherwise seek to mimic or leverage our intellectual property. Counterfeiting and other infringing activities typically increase as brand recognition increases, and association of our brands with inferior counterfeit reproductions or third party labels could adversely affect the integrity and reputation of our brands.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. As we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of the sourcing, distribution and marketing of our brands\u2019 products, we could become subject to litigation or challenge based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, including by various third parties who have acquired or claim ownership rights in some of our trademarks internationally. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful or would otherwise affect our operations, we may be required to pay damages, royalties, license fees or other costs to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using, or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time. Litigation and other legal action of this type, regardless of whether it is successful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of the attention of our management and other resources.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation, which may cause us to incur substantial expenses or unexpected liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation matters, which may relate to consumer protection, employment practices, leasing arrangements, intellectual property infringement and contract disputes, and which may include a class action, and we are subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business operations. Often, these cases raise complex factual and legal issues and, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. Regardless of the outcome or whether the claims have merit, legal proceedings may be expensive and require significant management time.\nOur common stock price may be highly volatile, and we may be unable to meet investor and analyst expectations.\nOur common stock, which is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange, may be subject to extreme and unpredictable fluctuations in price. The market price of our common stock may decline if the results of our operations or projected results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or our shareholders, investors are unreceptive to an announcement of changes in our business or our strategic initiatives or securities analysts who follow our company change their ratings or estimates of our future performance. Our stock price may also change suddenly as a result of other factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, new or modified legislation impacting our industry, announcements by our competitors, or sales of our stock by existing shareholders.\nThe stock market has also experienced periods of general volatility which result in fluctuations in stock prices unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. We cannot provide assurances that there will continue to be an active trading market for our stock, and the price of our common stock may also be affected by illiquidity or perceived\nilliquidity of our shares. In addition, although we have paid dividends in each quarter since we became a public company in July 1960, we may discontinue or reduce dividend payments based upon several factors, including the terms of our credit facility and applicable law, the need for funding for our strategic initiatives or other capital expenditures and our future cash needs. Any modification or suspension of dividends could cause our stock price to decline. We also may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges or disruptions in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others.\nIn December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $150 million share repurchase authorization. Pursuant to that authorization, we entered into a share repurchase plan that commenced during the latter part of the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that a share repurchase will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the plan\u2019s effectiveness. Any failure to pay dividends or conduct share repurchases at expected levels, may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nOther factors may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOther risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, could negatively impact our business and financial performance, including changes in social, political, labor, health and economic conditions; changes in the operations or liquidity of any of the parties with which we conduct our business, or in the access to capital markets for any such parties; increasing costs of customer acquisition, activation and retention; consolidation in the retail industry and other factors. Any of these risks, and others of which we are not aware or that we currently consider to be immaterial, could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 34948, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "OXM"}
