{"cik": "1328571", "company": "NTELOS HOLDINGS CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely impact our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any or all of these risks. Until the consummation of the Merger, we are subject to a number of business uncertainties and contractual restrictions under the Merger Agreement.\nRisk Factors Related to the Merger with Shentel\nThere are risks related to the Merger that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nCompletion of the Merger with Shentel is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including approval of our stockholders and various government and regulatory approvals. Several of these conditions have been substantially satisfied, however, we have not received approval, or any indication thereof, from the FCC. There is no assurance that all conditions will be satisfied, that the FCC will provide its approval, or that the Merger will be consummated within the expected time frame or at all. If the Merger is not completed, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a premium related to the potential Merger consideration. Prior to the announcement of the proposed Merger, our common stock traded at a materially lower price. In addition, under certain circumstances, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may be required to pay Shentel a termination fee of $8.8 million, plus the reimbursement of up to $2.5 million of fees, costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Shentel in connection with the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement also restricts us from engaging in certain activities and taking certain actions without Shentel\u2019s approval, which could prevent us from pursuing opportunities that may arise prior to the closing of the Merger.\nThe pendency of the Merger, and potential failure to complete the Merger, could materially and adversely impact our business.\nThe Merger with Shentel could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example:\n\u25cf\nour employees may experience uncertainty about us and their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key managers and other employees;\n\u25cf\ncustomers and suppliers may experience uncertainty about the future and may seek alternative business relationships with third parties or seek to alter their business relationships with us;\n\u25cf\nthe attention of our management may be directed to transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day operations of our business; and\n\u25cf\nwe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger with Shentel, and many of these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether we consummate the transaction.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed, our Board of Directors may consider various alternatives available to us, including, among others, continuing as a public company with no material changes to our business or capital structure, seeking to raise capital through the sale of equity or debt securities, seeking additional debt financing, or attempting to sell our company to another potential acquirer. These alternatives may involve additional risks to our business, including, among others, risks related to the diversion of management\u2019s attention and additional expenses, our ability to consummate any such alternative transaction, our ability to obtain capital sufficient to operate our business, the valuation assigned to our business in any such alternative transaction, our ability or a potential buyer\u2019s ability to access capital on acceptable terms or at all and other matters that may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business\nIncreased competition and new market entrants in the wireless industry could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCompetition in the wireless industry is currently intense and is expected to continue to be intense. Our competition is led by the four largest nationwide providers of wireless services dominating the market. Our competition in the markets we serve have significantly greater resources than us, which could put us at a disadvantage in such things as product offerings, pricing, and roaming services. Additionally, new entrants have recently announced their intentions to compete for wireless subscribers, including cable companies and Google, potentially further increasing the competitive landscape. Our ability to effectively compete in this highly competitive market could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain subscribers, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are primarily in the business of selling wireless communications services to subscribers, and our success in that business is based on our ability to attract new subscribers and retain current subscribers. Our business strategy to attract and retain subscribers historically has been to differentiate our regional brand relative to our primary competitors, most of whom are national providers, based on offering our customers savings and service. Although attracting new subscribers and retaining existing subscribers are both important to the financial viability of our business, there is an added focus on customer retention because the costs of adding a new subscriber, including but not limited to commissions, equipment subsidies and other sales incentives, are significantly higher than the costs associated with retaining an existing subscriber.\nIf our business strategy is unsuccessful and we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those offered by our competitors, we may have difficulty attracting new customers and retaining current subscribers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results due to reduced revenues and higher operating costs.\nThe telecommunications industry is generally characterized by rapid development and technological innovations, which could increase our operating costs and diminish our ability to attract and retain subscribers, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe telecommunications industry has been, and we believe will continue to be, characterized by several trends, including the rapid development and introduction of new technologies and services, including but not limited to 5G, voice over WiFi or other technologies. A number of our competitors have deployed or are in the process of deploying next generation technologies that are focused on the provisioning of mobile data services with even higher speeds, which increasingly are becoming a critical component of many wireless service provider offerings. We believe our continued success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate or adapt to technological changes, to complete our 4G network upgrade plan, and to offer, on a timely basis, new services and technologies that meet customer demands.\nAs new technologies are developed and deployed by competitors in our service area, some of our subscribers may select other providers\u2019 offerings based on price, capabilities and personal preferences. We may not be able to respond to future changes and obtain access to new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. The development of these new technologies, products and services may cause us to incur considerably more in capital expenditures and incremental operating costs than we have anticipated. To the extent that we do not keep pace with technological advances, fail to offer technologies comparable to those of our competitors or fail to respond timely to changes in competitive factors in our industry, we could lose existing customers and experience a decline in revenues and net income. Each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of our largest wholesale customer, Sprint, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated approximately 37.8% of our revenues from the SNA with Sprint. In May 2014 the parties reached an amended agreement to extend the SNA through at least December 2022. Our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer material adverse consequences due to lost revenues and decreased cash flows if (a) we were to lose Sprint as a customer, such as because of termination of the SNA due to our failure to upgrade to 4G LTE as required, (b) we are unable to realize the benefits under the SNA, such as preferred device pricing and nationwide 4G LTE roaming charges, or (c) Sprint experiences severe financial difficulties and/or is unwilling or unable to pay our charges or becomes bankrupt.\nThe pricing arrangements under our SNA with Sprint may fluctuate and there could be a decrease in the usage of our networks by Sprint customers, either of which could result in a decline in our wholesale revenues.\nUnder the SNA, our wholesale revenues are based on usage of our network by Sprint\u2019s customers. In May 2014 the parties reached an amended agreement to extend the SNA through at least December 2022. The billable fixed fee element of the agreement was reduced pursuant to the amended SNA on August 1, 2015 and again on January 1, 2016. Additional annual reductions will occur on January 1 of each year resulting in a continual decrease of payments for the fixed fee element. Sprint could make changes to its subscriber contracts and national calling plans that could result in a decline in its overall subscriber base or Sprint may choose to manage its customers or distribution in our territories differently or take steps that reduce customer data or voice usage of our network. Additionally, we could experience migration by Sprint of its customers to non-CDMA technology, such as WiFi offloading or see a decline in the usage of our network by Sprint if we are unable to meet their customer demand for data services or fail to successfully design, build and deploy new technologies and services. If any or all of such events were to occur, or if, for any other reason, fewer Sprint customers were using our network or we experience lower usage of our network by Sprint, we could experience reduced revenues from Sprint.\nUnder the SNA, there are provisions, including rate reset provisions, which could, and have previously, resulted in disputes between us and Sprint from time to time. The SNA features a dispute resolution process which historically the parties have used in order to resolve open disputes. However, there can be no assurance that any future disputes will be resolved to our satisfaction and it is possible that the dispute resolution process might yield a result that would potentially lower Sprint\u2019s payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur largest competitors may build networks in our markets or use alternative suppliers, which may result in decreased revenues and severe price-based competition.\nThe national carriers and other larger wireless providers are investing substantial capital to deploy the necessary equipment for 4G LTE, LTE-A, 5G, and other enhanced network technologies and services, and may build or expand their own wireless networks in our service areas or obtain roaming services from alternative sources. Additionally, if any current or potential roaming partner or new alternative facilities-based provider were to launch or expand networks in our markets, we could experience increased price competition and potential loss of roaming business, which would adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nOur inability to obtain or gain access to additional spectrum in the future, including the licensing of additional spectrum by the FCC, could adversely affect our ability to compete in providing wireless services.\nWe may need to acquire or gain access to additional spectrum in the future in order to continue our customer growth, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer data usage demands and deploy new technologies. The wireless industry in general is experiencing a spectrum shortage and there is no assurance that any additional spectrum will be made available by Congress or the FCC, through auction or otherwise, on a timely basis, on terms and conditions or under service rules that we consider suitable for our commercial uses. Any additional spectrum made available from the FCC or from third parties may not be compatible with our existing spectrum, may not be readily usable as a result of the lack of technical standards of that spectrum, or we may not be able to acquire such spectrum at a reasonable cost or at all. Furthermore, the continued aggregation of spectrum by the largest nationwide carriers who, in the past, generally have been disinclined to divest or lease spectrum in secondary market transactions, may reduce our ability to obtain or gain access to additional spectrum from other carriers. Each of these factors would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf suppliers or vendors experience problems or favor our competitors, we could fail to obtain sufficient quantities of devices and accessories, or the products and services we require to operate our network successfully.\nWe depend on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors, including Apple, Samsung and others, for devices and accessories. Due to the scale of our operations, we may have difficulty obtaining specific types of devices, applications and content in a timely manner, or at all. The lack of availability to us of some of the latest and most popular devices, applications, and content, whether as a result of exclusive dealings, volume discounting, or otherwise, could put us at a significant competitive disadvantage and could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain our customers, especially as our competitors continue to aggressively offer device promotions with increased features, functionality and applications.\nApple devices represent a significant percentage of all devices sold by us. We have extended our existing contract with Apple through May 28, 2016. However, if we are unable to further extend our contract with Apple or enter into a new contract on a longer-term basis, with reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to attract and retain subscribers would be materially impacted.\nWe also rely on a limited number of network equipment manufacturers, including Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco Systems, Inc. and others, related to our network infrastructure. If these suppliers experience manufacturing delays, interruptions or other\nproblems delivering equipment and network components on a timely basis, our revenue and operating results could suffer significantly. Our initial choice of a network infrastructure supplier can, where proprietary technology of the supplier is an integral component of the network, cause us effectively to be locked into one or a few suppliers for key network components. If these companies experience financial or other problems, alternative suppliers and vendors may become necessary and we may not be able to obtain satisfactory and timely replacement supplies on economically attractive terms, or at all.\nWe may incur significantly higher wireless device and other costs than we anticipate in attracting new and retaining current subscribers.\nSubscribers are purchasing data-centric devices and smartphones, such as the iPhone, as technological innovations occur. The cost of these multi-functional devices continues to increase as the number of features and applications they support increase. In addition, we believe we generally pay more, on average, to purchase devices than many of our national competitors, who buy from manufacturers in larger volumes. As more subscribers purchase or upgrade to new data-centric devices and smartphones, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected during the period of the sale or upgrade.\nThe loss of or inability to obtain or maintain voice and/or data roaming agreements, including for 4G LTE data roaming, at cost-effective rates or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on roaming agreements, primarily with Sprint and also with other wireless carriers, to provide nationwide coverage. These agreements are subject to renewal and termination rights, and if such agreements are terminated or not renewed, or the rates charged to us increase substantially, we may be required to pay significantly more for roaming service and we may be unable to provide competitive regional and nationwide wireless service to our customers on a cost-effective basis. If we are unable to meet our customers\u2019 expectations for nationwide coverage for the services they want, including data roaming, it could reduce the number of new customers we add to our services and may increase our customer churn. In addition, many of our roaming partners have changed their technology from 3G to 4G LTE which may impact our ability to maintain 3G roaming for our customers with 3G only devices. Any inability to retain or obtain such data roaming agreements, 3G and 4G LTE, at cost-effective rates may limit our ability to compete effectively for subscribers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFuture regulatory changes also may affect our ability to enter into new or maintain existing roaming agreements on competitive terms. We have encountered substantial difficulty attempting to negotiate what we believe are reasonable roaming rates for data services with a number of national carriers. We believe this is a result of the continuing consolidation that has occurred within the telecommunications industry, which has resulted in substantial amounts of spectrum being amassed by a few industry participants. We believe that the rates charged by the largest carriers for voice and data roaming services are higher than the rates such carriers charge to other roaming partners and resellers, and in most cases higher than they charge their retail customers, and that such carriers, due to their nationwide networks, do not have the necessary incentives to provide both voice and data roaming on reasonable terms and conditions. If we are unable to negotiate reasonable voice and data roaming rates, and in the absence of regulatory action to prevent the warehousing and effective blocking of access to the use of spectrum at reasonable roaming rates, we may be unable to provide nationwide roaming services to our customers on a cost-effective basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe offer customers the ability to purchase devices under an EIP with discounted postpaid service rates and the ability to upgrade more frequently than traditional postpaid contracts, which could result in higher churn, higher bad debt expense and higher retention expense, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn August 2014, we started offering EIP which differs from the traditional subsidized postpaid plans. These plans do not require a customer to sign a service agreement to obtain postpaid service, but allow the customer to finance their device over 24 months, receive a discount on the postpaid service and allow for more frequent upgrades than traditional plans. We could experience reduced revenues from higher churn, increased costs from additional upgrades, increased credit risk and bad debt expense, and increased marketing efforts to retain customers. In addition, allowing these customers to pay for their device over 24 months will have a negative impact on working capital. If our EIP offering strategy is ineffective, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on indirect distribution channels to sell our products and services and are concentrated with two primary third party dealers. If we are unable to attract, incentivize and retain these third-party dealers, our revenues could decline and our costs could increase.\nOur indirect distribution channel generates approximately 33.1% of our gross adds. Additionally, two primary third-party dealers represent approximately 85% of our total indirect gross adds. These two dealers along with the other dealers maintain\napproximately 142 indirect retail distribution locations, many of which are not exclusive dealers, which means that these dealers may sell other third-party products and services in direct competition with us. As more of our competitors use third-party dealers to sell their products and services, competition for dealers intensifies and larger wireless carriers may be able to switch our two primary indirect distribution dealers, as well as the other smaller dealers, to their products and services by presenting more lucrative commissions and other benefits, due to a wider variety of products and services offered by these competitors. Additionally, due to dealer mismanagement, industry trends, macro-economic developments, or other reasons, our indirect distribution agents may experience problems and may be unable to continue or grow their operations. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining dealers and any inability to do so could have a negative effect on our ability to attract and obtain customers, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, a number of dealers that sell our products and services operate a significant number of separate locations. The loss of one or more of such dealers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt in future years and fund our other business needs, and may require additional capital to upgrade and operate our business, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur ability to make payments on, or to refinance or repay, our debt, and to fund capital expenditures will depend largely upon our ability in the future to generate cash flows from operations, including from our wholesale relationship with Sprint, and to raise additional funds, including through the offering of equity or debt securities. Our future operating performance is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. Our business may not generate enough cash flow, or future borrowings may not be available to us under the NTELOS Inc. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts or fund our other liquidity needs, including any unanticipated capital expenditures. Any failure to pay our debts or fund our liquidity needs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and ability to compete.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total outstanding debt, including capital lease obligations, was approximately $523.4 million. The significant amount of cash required to service our contractual obligations could substantially limit our resources for alternative capital needs by, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain any additional financing we may need to operate, develop and expand our business;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flows from operations to service our debt, which reduces the funds available for operations and future business opportunities, potentially decreasing our ability to effectively compete in our industry; and\n\u2022\nexposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because our borrowings have variable interest rates, which could result in higher interest expense if interest rates rise.\nThe ability to make payments on our debt will depend upon our subsidiaries\u2019 future operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we cannot control. If the cash flows from our subsidiaries\u2019 operating activities are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may take actions, such as delaying or reducing capital expenditures, reducing or terminating the amount of our stock repurchase program, attempting to restructure or refinance our debt, selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital. Any or all of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations. Further, we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner or at all. The NTELOS Inc. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement limits our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take several of these actions. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could lead to our inability to repay our obligations under our indebtedness which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe NTELOS Inc. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement imposes operating covenants and restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions.\nThe NTELOS Inc. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement imposes operating covenants and restrictions on our subsidiaries. These covenants and restrictions generally:\n\u2022\nrestrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestrict our subsidiaries from entering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nrestrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets;\n\u2022\nrequire our subsidiaries to use a portion of \u201cExcess Cash Flow\u201d (as defined in the agreement) to repay indebtedness if our leverage ratio exceeds specified levels; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or make advances to us to grant dividends.\nThese covenants and restrictions could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock, finance our future operations or capital needs or pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default of the NTELOS Inc. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. If a default occurs, our indebtedness under the NTELOS Inc. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement could be declared immediately due and payable, which could have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\nWe are exposed to certain market risks including the impact of interest rate changes, due to our substantial level of indebtedness. If interest rates for our long-term debt increase, our future cash interest expense could be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. See Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more specific information related to our exposure to changes in interest rates.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nOur credit risk is evaluated by independent rating agencies, which could downgrade our credit ratings in the future. Any downgrade could affect our ability to raise money in the future or increase the cost of new borrowings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.\nOur business is led by a small number of key executive officers, and directed by a core group of senior level financial and operational management, technical and sales personnel (\u201cqualified personnel\u201d). We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly knowledgeable qualified personnel. We believe that competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future sufficient to support our continued growth. We have experienced occasional difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such difficulties in the future. In addition, at this time, the exercise price of a substantial portion of our stock options is above, and in some cases significantly above, the current trading prices of our common stock, which we believe negatively impacts our retention of qualified personnel. The departure of, or our inability to attract or retain, highly qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we lose the right to install our equipment on wireless cell sites or are unable to renew expiring leases for wireless cell sites on favorable terms or at all, our business and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 99% of our cell sites were installed on leased facilities, with approximately 57% of the leased facilities installed on facilities owned by three tower companies, American Tower, Crown Communications and SBA, pursuant to license agreements, lease agreements, master lease agreements or master license agreements that govern the general terms of our use of that company\u2019s facilities. If a license agreement, lease agreement, master lease agreement or master license agreement with one of these tower companies were to terminate, or if one of these tower companies were unable to support our use of its facilities, we would have to find new sites or rebuild the affected portion of our network. In addition, the concentration of our cell site leases with a limited number of tower companies could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition if we are unable to renew our expiring leases with these tower companies either on terms comparable to those we have today or at all. If any of the tower companies with which we do business were to experience severe financial difficulties, or file for bankruptcy protection, our ability to use facilities leased from that company could be adversely affected. If a material number of cell sites were no longer available for our use, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nA change or disruption in our system infrastructure, including those from our third-party vendors, or our systems\u2019 ability to support changes in technologies and services expected by customers, could materially adversely affect our business.\nSophisticated information and billing systems are vital to our ability to monitor and control costs, bill customers, process customer orders, provide customer service, capture financial data and achieve operating efficiencies. We currently rely on\ninternal systems and third-party vendors to provide all of our information and processing systems. A disruption in our systems could be caused by aging systems and software, improperly installed new or upgraded business intelligence tools, performance issues experienced from our third party vendors, and dependency on licensing agreements. Additionally, our systems may not be able to support new technologies or changes to add and retain customers. In the event of any such disruption or inability to support technologies or expectations, we may not be able to conduct business in the normal course, which could cause a loss of customers and revenue and incur significant costs to repair or replace such systems.\nIn addition, we may, in the future, migrate our internal billing and point of sale systems to new third-party systems. Our inability to successfully migrate customers to new billing systems could result in billing delays and negative impacts to sales and customer service. These factors could materially adversely affect our business.\nA disruption to our operations or those of other companies critical to our network operations could cause delays or interruptions of service, which could cause us to lose revenues and incur expenses.\nTo be successful, we must provide our customers reliable network service. Some of the risks to our network and infrastructure include:\n\u2022\nphysical damage to outside plant facilities including third-party locations and network providers;\n\u2022\npower surges or outages;\n\u2022\nsoftware defects;\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\ndisruptions beyond our control, including disruptions caused by terrorist activities or severe weather; and\n\u2022\nfailures in operational support systems.\nNetwork disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose revenues and incur expenses.\nUnauthorized use of, or interference with, our network could disrupt service and increase our costs.\nWe may incur costs associated with the unauthorized use of our network including administrative and capital costs associated with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidence of fraud. Fraudulent use of our network may impact interconnection costs, capacity costs, administrative costs, fraud prevention costs and payments to other carriers for fraudulent roaming.\nCyber events may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers and significant expenses.\nOur network and systems, including those of our third party vendors, may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, hacking, theft, or similar unauthorized access and disruptive problems that pose risks to our ability to sustain service levels and ensure data security (collectively, \u201ccyber events\u201d). Cyber events are not limited to particular groups or locations and may be committed by employees or third parties from any location, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures or remedies may be unavailable or ineffective. We do experience cyber events and attempts of cyber events of varying degrees periodically, however, to date, none have been material, individually or in aggregate, to our operational or financial condition. We maintain technical and administrative controls in an effort to reduce the risks and potential of cyber events and maintain insurance in an effort to mitigate the expenses associated with the occurrence of a cyber event. However, such controls and/or insurance may become more expensive or difficult to obtain, or prove insufficient to repel or mitigate a cyber event in the future.\nCyber events may cause equipment failure or damage, or disrupt our networks and systems and those of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties we rely on. Damaged equipment, reduced network capacity, or other issues with networks or systems that may result from a cyber event may be difficult to remedy in a timely or cost effective manner. Our inability to operate networks or systems or provide services to our customers, even for a limited period of time, could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, a cyber event may result in confidential, personal, and/or payment information regarding our customers being accessed, stolen, deleted, modified, or published. Improper access to, misuse, or disclosure of such information could result in substantial harm to our customers and to us. We may incur significant expenses for any cyber event, including investigating the cause of the cyber event, repair or replacement of affected equipment, legally mandated notification costs, expensive incentives offered to existing customers to retain their business, increased expenditures on security measures, lost revenues, and/or litigation. Additionally, as a result of any cyber event, we may suffer damage to our reputation, which could result in a loss of customers or suppliers and adversely impact customer and investor confidence. The occurrence of any cyber event could result in a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe and our suppliers may be subject to claims of infringement regarding telecommunications technologies that are protected by patents and other intellectual property rights.\nIn general, we do not manufacture any of the equipment or software used in our telecommunications businesses and we do not own any patents. Instead, we purchase the infrastructure equipment, handsets and software used in our business from third parties and we obtain licenses to use the associated intellectual property. Telecommunications technologies are protected by a wide variety of patents and other intellectual property rights. We and some of our suppliers and service providers may receive assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties. These claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services. The manufacturers and suppliers that provide us with the equipment and technology we use in our business may agree to indemnify us against possible infringement claims. However, we do not always have such indemnification protections in place and, even if we have such agreements in place, we may not be fully protected against all losses associated with infringement claims. In addition, the manufacturers and suppliers also may require us to indemnify them against infringement claims asserted against them with respect to equipment they sell to us. Whether or not infringement claims are valid or successful, such claims could adversely affect our business by diverting management attention, involving us in costly and time-consuming litigation, requiring us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements (which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all), or requiring us to cease certain activities or to cease selling certain products and services to avoid claims of infringement.\nIf our long-lived or indefinite lived assets become impaired, it would materially adversely affect impact our operating results.\nWe test long-lived assets and intangibles subject to amortization for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances include declines in stock price, market capitalization, financial performance, or expectation of selling or disposing of an asset group or reporting unit. We are required to record a significant charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment was determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. In 2014, we recorded impairment charges on certain long-lived and indefinite-lived assets in the Eastern Markets. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe impact of economic downturns or other conditions leading to a decline in consumer discretionary spending may harm our business and materially adversely impact our operating results.\nThe impact of economic downturns on our customers, including unemployment and disruptions to the credit and financial markets, could cause customers to reduce spending. If demand for our services decreases, deactivations might increase and our revenues could be affected. In addition, during challenging economic times our customers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impair their ability to pay for services they have purchased and lead to greater expense for uncollectible customer balances. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide services or to which we outsource certain functions. The same economic conditions that may affect our customers could negatively affect such vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in quality or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. Any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by such third parties could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of our licenses could adversely affect our ability to provide wireless services.\nOur wireless licenses are generally valid for ten years from the effective date of the license. Licensees may renew their licenses for additional ten-year periods by filing renewal applications with the FCC. Our wireless licenses expire in various years. The renewal applications are subject to FCC review and potentially public comment to ensure that the licensees meet their licensing requirements and comply with other applicable FCC mandates. If we fail to file for renewal at the appropriate time or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, we could be denied a license renewal and, accordingly, our ability to provide or continue to provide service in that license area would be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, many of our licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements. While the licensees have generally met \u201csafe harbor\u201d standards for ensuring such benchmarks are met, we have relied on, and will in the future rely on, \u201csubstantial service\u201d thresholds for meeting build-out requirements. In such cases, there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction sufficient to meet the applicable construction requirement, in which case the FCC could terminate our license and our ability to continue to provide service in that license area would be adversely affected.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to legislative changes or regulatory requirements, which could affect our ability to compete and offer services.\nAs competition develops and technology evolves, federal and state regulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change. We anticipate that this state of regulatory flux will continue in the future as the FCC and state regulators respond to competitive, technological and legislative developments by modifying their existing regulations or adopting new ones. A number of recent actions indicate that the FCC will be proactive and potentially increase the regulatory requirements of wireless service providers. At this time, pending congressional legislative efforts to reform the Communications Act may cause major industry and regulatory changes that are difficult to predict. Taken together or individually, new or changed regulatory requirements affecting the telecommunications industry may harm our business and restrict the manner in which we operate our business. The enactment of adverse regulation or regulatory requirements may slow our growth and have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with regulatory mandates could adversely affect our ability to provide wireless services.\nThe FCC regulates the licensing, operation, acquisition and sale of the licensed spectrum that is essential to our business. We must comply with a number of regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, E-911, CALEA and the customer privacy mandates of the Customer Proprietary Network Information rules. We also must comply with regulations pertaining to the winning bid of our subsidiary in Mobility Fund Phase I. The FCC has taken an expansive view with respect to the scope of its authority over wireless carriers, which may lead to increased regulation of such carriers in the future. In addition, we must pay a variety of federal and state surcharges and fees on our gross revenues derived by interstate and intrastate services, the amount of which may be subject to review and revision in the future. Failure to comply with these and other regulatory requirements may have an adverse effect on our licenses or operations and could result in sanctions, fines or other penalties.\nOn January 29, 2015, the FCC adopted additional rules and regulations that require us and other carriers to implement requirements regarding location accuracy requirements for E-911. These stronger rules will enhance the ability of Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to accurately identify the location of wireless 911 callers when a caller is indoors. These revised rules also strengthen the FCC\u2019s existing E-911 location accuracy rules to improve location determination for outdoor calls as well. In addition, the FCC, in March 2015, adopted net neutrality rules for broadband Internet providers, including mobile broadband Internet providers, in which such providers would not be able to engage in various forms of blocking, throttling or engaging in paid prioritization agreements with respect to Internet content, subject to reasonable network management. The FCC also adopted enhanced transparency rules and a general conduct rule regarding behavior of broadband Internet providers. In doing so, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet service as a Title II service under the Communications Act. These network neutrality rules have been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and such appeal remains pending. We cannot predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of any Court action. The FCC, together with the FAA, also regulates tower marking and lighting. In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation. The FCC adopted significant changes to its rules governing historic preservation review of projects, which makes it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities, and is considering changes to its rules regarding environmental protection as related to tower construction, which, if adopted, could make it more difficult to deploy facilities.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements or may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we along with our independent registered public accounting firm are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to design and maintain effective internal controls could constitute a material weakness which could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures or failure to prevent fraud. If we were unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls, investor confidence regarding our financial statements and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these tax matters. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. We also estimate our ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of NOL carry-forwards and tax credits. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our taxes.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our judgments or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and reserves. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense or operating taxes, and therefore could have a material impact on our net income and cash flows.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. President Obama\u2019s administration has announced proposals for other U.S. tax legislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect our tax rate. There are other tax proposals that have been introduced, that are being considered, or that have been enacted by Congress that could affect our tax rate or our tax liabilities. Any of these changes could affect our net income and cash flows.\nIncreases in our costs of providing benefits under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and accounting policy elections. We are required to make assumptions and estimates that include the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, our expected level of contributions to the plans, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among other factors. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If our benefit plans\u2019 costs increase, due to adverse changes in the U.S. securities markets, resulting in worse-than-assumed investment returns and discount rates, and adverse medical cost trends, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has historically been volatile and may continue to be volatile and may not reflect our actual operations and performance.\nPrior to entering into the Merger Agreement, the trading price of our common stock had been and may in the future, particularly in the event that the Merger is not consummated, be subject to significant fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors unrelated to our performance, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual operating results or those of our competitors, including announcements of subscribers and churn rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by us or changes in financial estimates or recommendations by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the media or investment community about, or actual changes in, our current or future relationship with Sprint;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in Sprint\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in general or industry specific market conditions, trends or governmental regulations and approvals;\n\u2022\nconditions, trends or changes in the securities marketplace or stock market performance in the United States, including trading volumes;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in economic conditions, including the cost and availability or perceived availability of additional capital and market perceptions relating to our access to this capital;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of other companies operating in our industry;\n\u2022\nsignificant or sustained changes to our market capitalization;\n\u2022\ntechnological innovations by us or our competitors, including the availability of 4G LTE and/or deployment of next generation networks;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, significant contracts or divestitures;\n\u2022\nannouncements of investigations, regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic and global economic and political factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales of our common stock by our directors, executive officers or affiliates.\nStock price volatility and sustained decreases in our share price could subject our stockholders to losses and us to takeover bids or lead to action by the NASDAQ. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nQuadrangle continues to have significant influence over our business and could delay, deter or prevent a change of control, change in management or business combination that may not be beneficial to our stockholders and as a result, may depress the market price of our stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Quadrangle beneficially owned approximately 4.2 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, two of the eight directors that serve on our board of directors are representatives or designees of Quadrangle. By virtue of such stock ownership and representation on the board of directors, including a representative of Quadrangle being Chairman of the Board of Directors, Quadrangle continues to have the ability to influence corporate and management policies and all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of the directors, and to exercise significant control over our business, policies and affairs. Quadrangle\u2019s interests as a stockholder may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. In the event that the Merger is not consummated, such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control, change in management or business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders and, as a result, may depress the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and the General Corporation Law of Delaware could discourage potential acquisition proposals, could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could limit the price certain investors might be willing to pay for our common stock.\nAlthough our board of directors has approved the Merger Agreement, certain provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the state in which we are organized, and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit a change of control not approved by our board of directors or changes in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal our by-laws;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe inability of the stockholders to act by written consent; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and additional shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91099, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "NTLS"}
