{"cik": "1006269", "company": "LORAL SPACE & COMMUNICATIONS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nI. Risks Relating to the Transaction\nThe announcement and pendency of the Transaction may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the Transaction will be consummated. The Transaction Agreement contains a number of customary conditions that must be fulfilled to complete the Transaction, including (i) approval of (A) a majority of the outstanding Loral voting common stock and (B) a majority of the outstanding Loral voting common stock not held by MHR, PSP, any other party to the Transaction Agreement or certain of their respective affiliates; (ii) the parties having obtained certain regulatory consents and approvals; (iii) no legal proceedings having been commenced that would enjoin or prohibit the consummation of the Transaction; (iv) the listing of the Class A and Class B shares of Telesat Corporation on a U.S. securities exchange; (v) no \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect\u201d (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) having occurred; (vi) Telesat remaining in good standing with respect to its material debt obligations; (vii) the accuracy of certain representations (subject to certain qualifications as to materiality) and material performance of certain covenants by the parties, subject to specified exceptions; (viii) effectiveness of the registration statement on Form and the issuance of a receipt for each of the Canadian preliminary and final prospectuses in respect of the Transaction; (ix) no U.S., Canadian or Spanish governmental agency having commenced civil or criminal proceeding against Loral alleging that any member of the \u201cLoral Group\u201d has criminally violated any law, and no member of the \u201cLoral Group\u201d having been indicted or convicted for, or plead nolo contendere to, any such alleged criminal violation; (x) Loral remaining solvent and not having entered into any bankruptcy or related proceeding; and (xi) the delivery by the parties of certain closing deliverables. If the parties have confirmed that all the conditions are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which conditions are capable of being satisfied at the Closing), then PSP and Loral will each have the right to extend the Closing for any number of periods of up to 30 days each and no longer than 120 days in the aggregate, from the date on which the Closing otherwise would have occurred. If the Closing is extended, the Closing will occur on the first two consecutive business days commencing on the fifth business day after the expiration of the final extension period on which the conditions are satisfied or waived (other than the conditions (i) with respect to no \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect\u201d (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) having occurred, (ii) that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing and (iii) if PSP extends the Closing, with respect to a civil or criminal legal proceeding alleging that Loral or any of its subsidiaries (excluding XTAR and GdM and their subsidiaries), has criminally violated a law).\nThese conditions to the Closing may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Transaction may not be completed. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing and any extensions described above, we expect to complete the Transaction in the third quarter of 2021, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions for the Transaction will be satisfied or waived. In the event that the Transaction is not completed for any reason, we will remain an independent public company and holders of our common stock will continue to own their shares of common stock.\nAdditionally, if the Transaction is not completed and the Transaction Agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, Loral may be required to pay to Red Isle a termination fee of $6,550,000 or $22,910,000, or to pay to PSP a \u201cbreach\u201d fee of $40,000,000, in each case as provided in the Transaction Agreement. If we are required to make any of these payments, doing so may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhether or not we complete the Transaction, we may be subject to certain risks and consequences (all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Transaction) as a result of pursuing the Transaction, including, among others, the following:\n\u25cf consummation of the Transaction will require significant time and attention from management, which may distract management from operating our business and executing on other initiatives that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u25cf we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Transaction. These fees and costs will be substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filings fees and printing costs;\n\u25cf legal proceedings in connection with the Transaction, if any, could delay or prevent the completion of the Transaction and lead to additional costs;\n\u25cf restrictions in the Transaction Agreement on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Transaction may adversely affect our ability to operate our business; and\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including a material adverse effect on the stock price of Loral, particularly if we fail to complete the Transaction.\nThe anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe success of the Transaction will depend, in part, on the ability of Telesat Corporation to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction, including possibly accessing the public equity markets to fund Telesat\u2019s planned low-earth-orbit constellation, Telesat receiving certain important covenant relief under the terms of Telesat\u2019s existing debt securities due to Telesat being beneficially owned by a single public company such as Telesat Corporation, maintaining the Canadian character of Telesat and preserving Canadian government support therefor and improving liquidity over time, including by potentially attracting the interest of Canadian institutional investors. If Telesat Corporation is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits to shareholders may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the market price of publicly traded common shares of Telesat Corporation may be volatile and could decline.\nMany of these factors will be outside of Telesat Corporation\u2019s control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and other adverse impacts, which could materially affect Telesat Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nII. Financial, Capital Structure and Telesat Investment Risk Factors\nOur equity investment in Telesat may be at risk because of Telesat\u2019s leverage.\nAt December 31, 2020, Telesat had outstanding indebtedness of $2.5 billion, which matures in 2026 and 2027, and additional borrowing capacity of $200 million under its revolving facility which matures in 2024. Approximately $1.95 billion of this total borrowing capacity is secured by substantially all of Telesat\u2019s assets excluding the assets of unrestricted subsidiaries such as the subsidiary that is developing the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. This indebtedness represents a significant amount of indebtedness for a company the size of Telesat. The agreements governing this indebtedness impose operating and financial restrictions on Telesat\u2019s activities. These restrictions on Telesat\u2019s ability to operate its business could seriously harm its business by, among other things, limiting its ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities, which could in time adversely affect the value of our investment in Telesat. Borrowings under Telesat\u2019s senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose Telesat to interest rate risk. Assuming all revolving loans are fully drawn, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $3.1 million change in annual interest expense on indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities. Telesat has entered into, and in the future it may enter into, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. Telesat may not, however, maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all or any of its variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps Telesat enters into may not fully mitigate its interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous or may create additional risks.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of Telesat\u2019s outstanding debt was denominated in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates impact the amount that Telesat pays in interest and may significantly increase the amount that Telesat is required to pay in Canadian dollar terms to redeem the indebtedness either at maturity, or earlier if redemption rights are exercised or other events occur which require Telesat to offer to purchase the indebtedness prior to maturity, and to repay funds drawn under its U.S. dollar denominated facility. Unfavorable exchange rate changes could affect Telesat\u2019s ability to repay or refinance this debt.\nA breach of the covenants contained in any of Telesat\u2019s loan agreements, including without limitation, a failure to maintain the financial ratios required under such agreements, could result in an event of default. If an event of default were to occur, Telesat\u2019s lenders would be able to accelerate repayment of the related indebtedness, and it may also trigger a cross default under other Telesat indebtedness.\nIf Telesat is unable to repay or refinance its secured indebtedness when due (whether at the maturity date or upon acceleration as a result of a default), the lenders will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which consists of substantially all of the assets of Telesat and its subsidiaries. Telesat\u2019s ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its debt, will depend largely upon its future operating performance and market conditions. Disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult to renew or extend Telesat\u2019s facilities at current commitment levels on similar terms or at all. In the event that Telesat is not able to service or refinance its indebtedness, there would be a material adverse effect on the fair value of our equity investment in Telesat.\nWhile we own 62.6% of Telesat on an economic basis, we own only 32.6% of its voting stock and therefore do not have the right to elect or appoint a majority of the members of its Board of Directors and our interests and those of the other Telesat shareholders may diverge or conflict.\nWhile we own 62.6% of the economic interests in Telesat, we hold only 32.6% of its voting interests. Although the restrictions on foreign ownership of Canadian satellites have been removed by the government of Canada, we are still subject to our shareholders agreement with PSP and the articles of incorporation of Telesat, which do not allow us to own more voting stock of Telesat than we currently own. Also, under our shareholders agreement, the governance and management of Telesat is vested in its 10-member Board of Directors, comprised of three Loral-appointed directors, three PSP-appointed directors and four independent directors, two of whom also own Telesat shares with nominal economic value and 31.2% and 6.8% of the voting interests for Telesat directors, respectively. While we own a greater voting interest in Telesat than any other single stockholder with respect to election of directors and we and PSP, which owns 29.4% of the voting interests for directors and 67.4% of the voting interests for all other matters, together own a majority of Telesat\u2019s voting power, circumstances may occur where our interests and those of PSP diverge or are in conflict. In the event that our interests differ from those of PSP, PSP, with the agreement of at least three of the four independent directors, may, subject to veto rights that we have under Telesat\u2019s shareholders agreement, cause Telesat to take actions contrary to our wishes. These veto rights are, however, limited to certain extraordinary actions - for example, the incurrence of more than $100 million of indebtedness or the purchase of assets at a cost in excess of $100 million. Moreover, our right to block these actions under the shareholders agreement falls away if, subject to certain exceptions, either (i) ownership or control, directly or indirectly by Dr. Mark H. Rachesky (President of MHR Fund Management LLC (\u201cMHR\u201d), which, through its affiliated funds is our largest stockholder) of our voting stock falls below certain levels other than in certain specified circumstances or (ii) there is a change in the composition of a majority of the members of Loral\u2019s Board of Directors over a consecutive two-year period without the approval of the incumbent directors.\nLoral Space & Communications Inc. is a holding company with no current operations; we are dependent upon, and may not receive, sufficient cash flow from our affiliates or be able to incur sufficient borrowings to meet our financial obligations.\nLoral is a holding company with ownership interests in Telesat and XTAR and, as such, Loral has no independent operations or operating assets and has ongoing cash requirements. We are dependent upon, and may not receive, sufficient cash flow from our affiliates or be able to incur sufficient borrowings to meet our financial obligations.\nThe ability of Telesat and XTAR to make payments or distributions to Loral, whether as dividends or as payments under applicable consulting agreements or otherwise, will depend on their operating results, including their ability to satisfy their own cash flow requirements, and obligations including, without limitation, their debt service obligations. Moreover, covenants contained in the debt agreements of Telesat impose limitations on its ability to dividend or distribute funds to Loral. Even if the applicable debt covenants would permit Telesat to pay dividends or make distributions, Loral will not have the ability to cause Telesat to do so. See above \u201cWhile we own 62.6% of Telesat on an economic basis, we own only 32.6% of its voting stock and therefore do not have the right to elect or appoint a majority of the members of its Board of Directors and our interests and those of the other Telesat shareholders may diverge or conflict.\u201d Likewise, any dividends or distributions by XTAR would require the prior consent of our Spanish partner in the joint venture.\nAlthough our equity in Telesat has substantial value, our shareholders agreement with PSP regarding Telesat limits our ability to pledge our shares in Telesat as collateral for borrowing. For so long as the shareholders agreement is in place in its current form, we may not be able to borrow or access the debt markets on a secured basis to fund our financial obligations, and our ability to borrow or access the debt markets on an unsecured basis may be limited or not available at all.\nOur voting common stock could be delisted by Nasdaq.\nOn January 5, 2021, we received a written notice (the \u201cNasdaq Notice\u201d) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Rule 5620(a) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the \u201cNasdaq Rules\u201d) as a result of the Company not having held an annual meeting of stockholders within 12 months of the end of the Company\u2019s fiscal year on December 31, 2019. The Nasdaq Notice stated that, under the Nasdaq Rules, the Company had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Rules. On February 17, 2021, we submitted to Nasdaq our plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Rules. In our submission, we informed Nasdaq that, on February 11, 2021, a draft registration statement (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) containing a preliminary proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company was confidentially submitted to the SEC, and as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement is filed and declared effective by the SEC, we intend to mail the definitive proxy statement and hold our 2020 Annual Meeting. If Nasdaq accepts our plan, Nasdaq may grant us an extension of time of up to 180 days from our fiscal year end, or June 30, 2021, to hold our 2020 Annual Meeting.\nIf Nasdaq accepts our plan but we are unable to hold our 2020 Annual Meeting before expiration of the extension granted by Nasdaq or if Nasdaq does not grant us an extension, the Nasdaq Rules provide that the Nasdaq staff immediately issue to the Company a staff delisting determination indicating the date on which the Company\u2019s voting common stock will be suspended from trading. In such case, the Company will, however, have the opportunity to request a review by a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. Delisting of our voting common stock by Nasdaq could result in a material adverse effect on the liquidity, and have an adverse effect on the trading value, of our shares.\nInstability in financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access additional capital.\nIn past years, the volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets reached unprecedented levels. If these conditions reoccur, there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material adverse effect on our ability to borrow money or have access to capital, if needed. Lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money. In addition, if we determine that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future, the future cost of raising funds through the debt or equity markets may be expensive or those markets may be unavailable. If we were unable to raise funds through debt or equity markets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face indemnification claims for pre-closing taxes from our sale of SSL.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Space Systems/Loral, LLC (formerly known as Space Systems/Loral, Inc.) (\u201cSSL\u201d), to MDA Communications Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Maxar Technologies Inc. (formerly known as MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.) (\u201cMDA\u201d). Under the terms of the purchase agreement related to the SSL sale, we are obligated to indemnify MDA and its affiliates for certain pre-closing taxes. The final amounts of certain indemnification claims relating to pre-closing taxes have not yet been determined. Where appropriate, we intend vigorously to contest the underlying tax assessments, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful. We may not be able to settle indemnification claims at or below the value recorded in our financial statements, and indemnification claims under the purchase agreement, whether pending now or made in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, including liquidity, and results of operations.\nIII. Risk Factors Associated With Satellite Services\nTelesat\u2019s in-orbit satellites may fail to operate as expected due to operational anomalies resulting in lost revenues, increased costs and/or termination of contracts.\nSatellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and therefore are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. The risks include in-orbit equipment failures, malfunctions and other kinds of problems commonly referred to as anomalies. Satellite anomalies include, for example, circuit failures, transponder failures, solar array failures, telemetry transmitter failures, battery cell and other power system failures, satellite control system failures and propulsion system failures. Some of Telesat\u2019s satellites have had malfunctions and other anomalies in the past. Acts of war, terrorism, magnetic, electrostatic or solar storms, space debris, satellite conjunctions or micrometeoroids could also damage Telesat\u2019s satellites.\nSatellite anomalies are likely to be experienced in the future, whether due to the types of anomalies described above or arising from the failures of other systems or components. Despite working closely with satellite manufacturers to determine the causes of anomalies and mitigate them in new satellites and to provide for intra-satellite redundancies for certain critical components to minimize or eliminate service disruptions in the event of failure, Telesat cannot assure that, in these cases, it will be possible to restore normal operations. Where service cannot be restored, the failure could cause the satellite to have less capacity available for sale, to suffer performance degradation or to cease operating prematurely, either in whole or in part.\nAny single anomaly or series of anomalies or other failure (whether full or partial) of any of Telesat\u2019s satellites could cause Telesat\u2019s revenues, cash flows and backlog to decline materially, could require Telesat to repay prepayments made by customers of the affected satellite and could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s relationships with current customers and its ability to attract new customers for satellite services. A failure could result in a customer terminating its contract for service on the affected satellite. If Telesat is unable to provide alternate capacity to an affected customer, the customer may decide to procure all or a portion of its future satellite services from an alternate supplier or the customer\u2019s business may be so adversely affected by the satellite failure that it may not have the financial ability to procure future satellite services. It may also require Telesat to expedite its planned replacement program, adversely affecting its profitability, increasing its financing needs and limiting the availability of funds for other business purposes. Finally, the occurrence of anomalies may adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to insure satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all, and may cause insurers to demand additional exclusions in policies they issue.\nSome of Telesat\u2019s satellites have experienced in-orbit anomalies and may in the future experience further anomalies that may affect their performance.\nA number of Telesat\u2019s in-orbit satellites have experienced anomalies and may in the future experience further anomalies that may affect their performance. Past anomalies include:\nNimiq Satellites:\nA number of LM A2100 series of satellites have suffered in-orbit failures of circuits on their solar arrays. Lockheed Martin has determined that Nimiq 1 and Nimiq 2 are in the family of spacecraft that is susceptible to this anomaly.\nTelesat\u2019s Nimiq 1 has suffered a number of solar array circuit/string failures, resulting in a reduction of total available power. Currently, the solar array power continues to support operations. In addition, Telesat\u2019s Nimiq 1 has suffered a number of battery cell failures, which have required some adjustments to the spacecraft\u2019s operations to support the provision of satellite services, including reducing the number of transponders available for use during periods of solar eclipse. Nimiq 1 has also experienced thruster anomalies that have required some adjustments to the spacecraft\u2019s operations but have not impacted service.\nIn February 2003, Nimiq 2 experienced an anomaly affecting the available power on the satellite. Lockheed Martin, the satellite\u2019s manufacturer, concluded the most likely cause of this anomaly was an electrical short-circuit caused by foreign object debris located in a single power-carrying connector. As a result of this anomaly, the south solar array power cannot be recovered. In addition, Nimiq 2 has experienced solar array circuit failures, resulting in a significant reduction of available power. These failures have substantially reduced the number of transponders Telesat can operate at saturation and it is currently expected that the available capacity will be further reduced over time. In April 2005, another satellite operator reported that a satellite of the same series as Nimiq 2 suffered a solar array anomaly that resulted in the complete loss of one array and a corresponding 50% reduction in available satellite power. Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer, has traced the most likely cause of this failure to a component on the solar array drive. Unlike Nimiq 1, Nimiq 2 has this component in its remaining functioning solar array. If this same component failed on the functioning array of Nimiq 2, it would result in a total loss of service of the satellite.\nAnik Satellites:\nAnik was designed with the capability to cover both North America and South America from the 107.3\u00b0 WL orbital location. In August 2001, Boeing, the manufacturer of the Anik satellite, advised Telesat of a gradual decrease in available power on-board the satellite. Boeing investigated the cause of the power loss and reported that the power will continue to degrade. Telesat procured a replacement satellite, AnikR, which was launched in 2005. The North American traffic on Anik was transferred to AnikR. Anik continued to provide coverage of South America until December 2020. Anik was recently moved to the 109.2\u00b0 WL orbital location where it commenced inclined orbit operations.\nTelesat has experienced and continues to experience intermittent anomalies with certain amplifiers in the Ka-band and Ku-band payloads on Anik. Boeing, the manufacturer, has completed its investigation of these anomalies. The majority of the affected Ka-band units continue to remain in service through modifying operational configurations. The Ku-band traveling-wave-tube amplifiers (\u201cTWTAs\u201d) that were affected as a result of these anomalies have failed. All but two of the failed transponders were replaced using spares and many of the Ku-band TWTAs currently in service have no further spares left to replace them should they fail. Anik has experienced an anomaly with one of its two telemetry transmitters. While the failure of a single telemetry transmitter does not impact satellite operations or the service Telesat provides to its customers, in the event Telesat is unable to restore any redundancy and the second telemetry transmitter were to fail, Telesat would cease receiving important information from the satellite regarding its position in orbit and health and Telesat\u2019s ability to operate the satellite would be adversely affected. A software patch for the satellite was developed by Boeing to provide telemetry to support operations in the event of a failure of the second transmitter and was implemented on the satellite in February 2013. Telesat\u2019s Anik satellite has also experienced an anomaly on one of the station-keeping thrusters. However, this thruster anomaly has had no impact on service and the thruster continues to support operations. There is a small Ka-band payload on Anik which experienced an anomaly following launch. Telesat implemented a plan to remedy the effect of this anomaly and the Ka-band payload is currently operational.\nTelstar Satellites:\nTelstar 12 VANTAGE began to suffer from degraded performance of four channels in late December 2016 due to increased noise levels. Following an investigation with the satellite manufacturer, the root cause of the anomaly was determined. As a result of this degradation, two channels on T12V are no longer usable. In 2017, Telesat received insurance proceeds in connection with this anomaly. Degradation of performance was observed on additional channels in May 2018 due to increased noise levels. The satellite manufacturer investigation concluded that the root cause of the anomaly was similar to that of the 2016 anomaly. The channels continue to support service. In the event of further degradation, Telesat may lose the capability to continue to use two channels.\nTelstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2\u2019s North solar array was damaged after launch and only partially deployed, diminishing the power and expected orbital maneuver life of the satellite. At the beginning of July 2011, the satellite began commercial service with substantially reduced available transponder capacity and with an expected end-of-orbital maneuver life reduced to 2024. It is currently expected that the available transponder capacity will be reduced over time. If the damaged solar array on Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 were to unexpectedly deploy in the future this could result in a loss of capability to provide service. In September 2016, the primary gyro utilized to maintain operational pointing of the satellite exhibited degraded performance. The backup gyro unit was switched into service and is currently in operation. A ground-based system has been implemented, which provides the capability to operate the satellite in the absence of a functioning on-board gyro. This system will reduce the demands on the backup gyro unit and provide redundancy.\nTelstar 19 VANTAGE has suffered a number of failures of a component that supports the operation of two of the three batteries on the satellite. The satellite manufacturer is currently conducting an investigation into the root cause of the anomaly. There is a risk that the satellite will experience additional failures of these components and that, absent an operational workaround, Telesat may reach a point where Telesat would be unable to provide services on all or some portion of the satellite during eclipse seasons (from approximately late February to mid-April and late August to mid-October each year, when operating the satellite for a period of time daily is dependent on battery power). Services on Telesat 19 VANTAGE have not been impacted by the failures thus far. Telesat believes that it can implement an operational workaround to maintain services on the satellite through the eclipse season even if the satellite suffers additional component failures on the batteries that have been impacted to date. However, should Telesat suffer additional component failures and the operational workaround be ineffective and another workaround could not be implemented, Telesat would be unable to provide service during eclipse seasons to all or some of its customers. If that were the case, the affected customers would be entitled to terminate their agreements with Telesat, Telesat would be required to repay a portion of any prepayments it received on the satellite associated with the terminated services, and Telesat revenues and operating results would be adversely affected.\nIn general, Telesat\u2019s satellites are exposed to the potential risk of loss.\nChanges in consumer demand for traditional television services and expansion of terrestrial networks have adversely impacted the growth in subscribers to DTH television services in North America, which may adversely impact Telesat\u2019s future revenues.\nA substantial amount of Telesat\u2019s revenue is earned from customers who use Telesat\u2019s services to provide DTH television services to the public in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 94% of Telesat\u2019s broadcast revenue was derived from North American DTH television services. For various reasons, the number of DTH subscribers to whom Telesat\u2019s customers provide services has been decreasing. In many regions of the world, including North America, the terrestrial networks with which Telesat competes continue to expand. Terrestrial networks have advantages over traditional DTH services for the delivery of two-way services, such as on-demand video services. Moreover, one of Telesat\u2019s largest DTH customers also has a substantial fiber terrestrial broadcast distribution network that it is continuing to expand, which has led to certain of its own DTH customers migrating to its terrestrial network. The migration of DTH customers to terrestrial networks, in order to access improved two-way services or for other reasons, could decrease the demand for Telesat\u2019s services, adversely impacting its future revenue and financial performance.\nThe growth of \u201cover-the-top\u201d (\u201cOTT\u201d) video distribution (e.g., Netflix) may also have an adverse impact on Telesat\u2019s business. OTT distribution is an on-demand (i.e., non-linear) platform that provides delivery of broadcasting services to consumers through an internet service provider that may not be involved in the control or distribution of the content itself. The growth of OTT distribution may have a negative impact on the demand for the services of some of Telesat\u2019s large DTH customers, which could result in lower demand for its satellite capacity\nFluctuations in available satellite capacity could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s results.\nThe availability of satellite capacity has fluctuated over time, characterized by periods of undersupply of capacity, followed by periods of substantial new satellite construction which is, in turn, followed by an oversupply of available capacity. The industry appears to be currently experiencing a period of oversupply. Given the number of new satellites launched over the past several years, many of which contain high throughput payloads, as well as the number of satellite constellations being deployed and under development, unless Telesat experiences a corresponding increase in demand, the next several years are likely to continue to be characterized by an oversupply of capacity. In addition, changes in technology could introduce a substantial amount of new capacity into the market, further exacerbating the oversupply problem. An oversupply of capacity leads to a decrease in rates charged for satellite services which could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nDevelopments that Telesat expects to support the growth in demand for satellite services, such as continued growth in corporate data and internet traffic, may fail to materialize or may not occur in the manner or to the extent Telesat anticipates.\nTelesat is subject to significant and intensifying competition within the satellite industry and from other providers of communications capacity. Telesat\u2019s failure to compete effectively would result in a loss of revenues and a decline in profitability, which would adversely affect Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat provides point-to-point and point-to-multipoint services for voice, data and video communications and for high-speed internet access. Telesat competes against global competitors who are substantially larger than Telesat in terms of both the number of satellites they have in orbit as well as in terms of their revenues. Due to their larger sizes, these operators are able to take advantage of greater economies of scale, may be more attractive to customers, may (depending on the specific satellite and orbital location in question) have greater flexibility to restore service to their customers in the event of a partial or total satellite failure and may be able to offer expansion capacity for future requirements. Telesat also competes against regional satellite operators who may enjoy competitive advantages in their local markets. As a result of the availability of export credit agency financing for projects that would not otherwise obtain financing from commercial lenders, new entrants, including governments that have traditionally purchased satellite capacity from established satellite operators, are acquiring their own satellites, which increases the amount of available satellite capacity in the marketplace and decreases demand for Telesat services.\nA substantial portion of Telesat\u2019s business is in the Canadian domestic market. This market is characterized by increasing competition among satellite providers and rapid technological development. The Canadian government opened Canadian satellite markets to foreign satellite operators for the provision of FSS, with the exception of DTH television services provided through FSS, as part of its 1998 WTO commitments to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services, and in September 2005 revised its satellite-use policy to permit the use of foreign-licensed satellites for digital audio radio services in Canada. Further liberalization of the policy may occur and could result in increased competition in Canadian satellite markets. Historically, the Canadian regulatory framework has required the use of Canadian-licensed satellites for the delivery of DTH in Canada whether through FSS or DBS facilities. It is possible that this framework could change and allow non-Canadian satellite operators that have adequate service coverage in Canadian territory to compete for future business from Telesat\u2019s DTH customers.\nTelesat\u2019s business is also subject to competition from ground-based forms of communications technology. For many point-to-point and other services, the offerings provided by terrestrial companies can be more competitive than the services offered via satellite. A number of companies are increasing their ability to transmit signals on existing terrestrial infrastructures, such as fiber optic cable, DSL (digital subscriber line) and terrestrial wireless transmitters often with funding and other incentives provided by government. The ability of any of these companies to increase their capacity and/or the reach of their network significantly would likely result in a decrease in the demand for Telesat\u2019s services. Increasing availability of capacity from other forms of communications technology can create an excess supply of telecommunications capacity, decreasing the prices Telesat would be able to charge for its services under new service contracts and thereby negatively affecting Telesat\u2019s profitability. New technology could render satellite-based services less competitive by satisfying consumer demand in other ways. Telesat also competes for local regulatory approval in places where more than one provider may want to operate, and with other satellite operators for scarce frequency assignments and a limited supply of orbital locations.\nA failure to compete effectively could result in a loss of revenues and a decline in profitability, a decrease in the value of its business and a downgrade of its credit rating, which would restrict its access to the capital markets.\nChanges in technology could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nThe implementation of new technologies that can provide increased capacity to end-users at lower cost may reduce demand for Telesat\u2019s services. Many of the new satellites deployed over the last several years and replacement satellites expected to be deployed in the near term will be high throughput satellites, which are able to transmit substantially more data than pre-existing satellites or may include high throughput payloads. These satellites may decrease demand and/or prices for traditional satellite capacity. While Telesat owns the high throughput Canadian payload on ViaSat-1, and has incorporated high throughput payloads on Telesat\u2019s Telstar 12 VANTAGE, Telstar 18 VANTAGE and Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites, the introduction of more, and more capable, high throughput satellites by other operators into the markets in which Telesat participates could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nA number of NGSO satellite projects are in development, production, or in the process of being deployed, which, if implemented successfully, could have significant advantages over geostationary satellite systems, in particular for latency sensitive applications. These projects have the potential to substantially increase the amount of available capacity in the marketplace, decreasing demand for geostationary satellite services. In addition to new satellite technologies, new projects which could compete with traditional satellite services have recently been announced, including for the provision of telecommunications services using balloons or drones.\nImprovements in existing technologies could also adversely impact the demand for satellite services. For example, improvements in signal compression could allow Telesat\u2019s customers to transmit the same amount of data using a reduced amount of capacity, which could decrease demand for Telesat\u2019s services.\nThere are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with Telesat\u2019s business, including the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation. Telesat may be unable to raise sufficient capital to fund the Telesat Lightspeed constellation, Telesat may ultimately choose to not proceed with the project or Telesat may proceed with the project and it may not be successful, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat is currently developing an advanced low earth orbit satellite network consisting of several hundred satellites in NGSO. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with NGSO constellations generally and with the Telesat Lightspeed constellation.\nNGSO constellations are complex. In order to operate successfully and deliver a high-quality service, all components of the system, both on the ground and in space, must be integrated seamlessly and efficiently. Unlike most traditional geostationary satellites currently in use, which rely on legacy, space-tested hardware and established ground equipment infrastructures, some of the technology necessary for the successful operation of a LEO constellation, in particular the Telesat Lightspeed constellation, is still in development. The Telesat Lightspeed constellation design incorporates leading-edge satellite technologies, including on-board data processing, multi-beam phased array antennas and optical inter-satellite links; these are technologies that have not been fully developed for space applications at the scale, levels of performance and price points that are required for the successful operation and commercialization of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. In addition, in order to provide a competitive service in certain of the customer segments Telesat plans to serve, Telesat requires advances in ground terminal design and manufacturing, particularly electronic flat panel antennas capable of acquiring and tracking LEO satellites. If the Telesat Lightspeed constellation does not deliver the required quality of service at prices that are competitive relative to other satellite providers and alternative products, Telesat may not be able to acquire customers and establish a successful business. It is possible that Telesat may not be able to overcome the technological hurdles required to complete the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation, or due to technological issues the Telesat Lightspeed constellation may not operate as planned.\nThe implementation of the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation will require a substantial outlay of capital and Telesat may not be able to raise sufficient capital to successfully develop and commercialize the project. While Telesat has entered into agreements with Thales Alenia Space to be the prime manufacturer for the Telesat Lightspeed constellation and with MDA to manufacture the phased array antennas, the execution of the definitive manufacturing agreements with Thales Alenia Space and MDA, the commencement of full construction activities and the final constellation deployment schedule are subject to, and conditional upon, the progress of the financing for the program. Similarly, while Telesat has announced that the government of Quebec intends to invest CAD 400 million into the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation, that investment is subject to a number of conditions including the entering into of a further definitive agreement, which for various reasons, may not occur. If unable to raise sufficient capital, Telesat will not be able to build and deploy the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. In addition, if Telesat is successful in raising sufficient capital to fund the Telesat Lightspeed constellation and the constellation does not operate as expected or is otherwise commercially unsuccessful, it could result in a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat\u2019s planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation will require Telesat to develop significant commercial and service operational capabilities. Failure to effectively develop such operational capabilities could cause the Telesat Lightspeed constellation to fail to achieve commercial viability and could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat\u2019s planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation will offer an end-to-end network service with responsibility from the Point of Presence, where the constellation connects to the terrestrial internet, to the end-user\u2019s terminal. This contrasts with Telesat\u2019s current GEO satellites, from which Telesat currently derives a majority of Telesat\u2019s revenue, where Telesat primarily provides customers with access to Telesat\u2019s GEO satellites, and customers then combine this capacity with ground (hub) equipment to create a connectivity service. Telesat\u2019s failure to develop new supporting technologies, processes and procedures, competencies, and other capabilities to support the Telesat Lightspeed constellation may materially impact Telesat\u2019s ability to monetize the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. Additionally, the Telesat Lightspeed constellation will require an advanced ecosystem to support LEO installation, including terminals and related installs, which does not currently exist.\nTelesat\u2019s effective monetization of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation may require Telesat to provide ancillary services to combine with Telesat\u2019s LEO services, as customers may demand these services to create a complete solution for the communications requirements. Some examples of ancillary services are trained third parties who can install and maintain Telesat\u2019s LEO terminals. Telesat does not currently have these capabilities, and may be required either to develop such capabilities in house or partner with third parties to deliver these capabilities, and Telesat cannot assure that Telesat will be able to successfully harness such capabilities.\nA material part of Telesat\u2019s anticipated revenues from the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation will come from geographies where Telesat does not have a significant presence today, including Europe, Africa and Asia, and the expansion of Telesat\u2019s capabilities in other geographies where Telesat currently has operations. Telesat\u2019s failure to expand Telesat\u2019s sales and distribution capabilities in these geographies could cause the Telesat Lightspeed constellation to fail to achieve commercial viability.\nIn order to effectively operate the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation, Telesat will be required to develop and expand certain business operations capabilities, including management of inventory, tracking service installation and commissioning, network monitoring and customer call resolution. Telesat will also need to develop new network capabilities to provision terminals, manage bandwidth and monitor these services. If Telesat is unable to develop these capabilities, Telesat may be unable to provide customers with a level of service sufficient to support the Telesat Lightspeed constellation\u2019s adoption. The development and deployment of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation may place a significant burden on Telesat\u2019s management and other internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and internal resources to the Telesat Lightspeed constellation and away from existing operations could harm business and operating results.\nEven if Telesat is able to successfully build and deploy the Telesat Lightspeed constellation, Telesat may nonetheless fail to generate anticipated revenues due to slow market adoption or because the total addressable market for the Telesat Lightspeed constellation may be smaller than Telesat expects.\nTelesat\u2019s projected revenues from the Telesat Lightspeed constellation are based on the anticipated expansion of the market for satellite services as the availability for higher quality, lower priced services will lead to increased uses of satellite services. However, there may be factors, both internal to and extraneous to the development and deployment of Telesat\u2019s LEO satellites, that slow market adoption of LEO constellations and cause Telesat\u2019s LEO revenues to be lower than anticipated. LEO antennas require much greater clearance than GEO antennas because LEO satellites are in constant motion from the perspective of the earth. This may mean that LEO antennas are more difficult to install than anticipated, which could limit the adoption of LEO technology. LEO constellations may also suffer a lack of service availability because heavy rains result in service outages at Ka-band, and the level and frequency of outages may negatively impact the size of the market for LEO services. Additionally, LEO is a new technology, and many potential customers may not be willing to purchase LEO services until this new technology obtains widespread adoption. In particular, if sufficient LEO terminals are not installed prior to the commencement of global service, it could lead to a failure to achieve anticipated revenues on a timeline that supports the Telesat Lightspeed constellation\u2019s commercial viability. Moreover, certain users, particularly governments, may have requirements, including security requirements that Telesat is unable to meet, leading to lack of access to important markets.\nTelesat\u2019s business plan for the Telesat Lightspeed constellation is based on Telesat\u2019s own analysis of the total addressable market for the constellation\u2019s services. It is possible that Telesat\u2019s analysis of the total addressable market for the Telesat Lightspeed constellation is inaccurate and the total addressable market could be materially smaller than Telesat\u2019s analysis suggested.\nAlthough Telesat believes there is a significant market for the services Telesat expects to provide with the Telesat Lightspeed constellation, Telesat may not be able to attract enough customers to make the project successful and earn a sufficient return on its investment, which could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat faces robust competition to build and effectively deploy the Telesat Lightspeed constellation, and/or the pursuit of a LEO constellation may negatively impact Telesat\u2019s existing business. Telesat also faces increasing competition in Telesat\u2019s existing services.\nTelesat Lightspeed constellation will also compete with NGSO satellite projects announced by other companies, including OneWeb, SpaceX, SES/O3b, Amazon and others, as well as country-sponsored projects in China and Russia. Some of these potential competitors to Telesat\u2019s system have greater access to capital than Telesat has and/or may be at a more advanced stage of development. For example, China and Russia have access to larger amounts of capital and have government-owned satellite manufacturing and launch facilities at their disposal. SpaceX and Amazon are much larger than Telesat, have more diverse sources of revenue and have substantially greater financial resources than Telesat does.\nMany of Telesat\u2019s competitors have greater access to launch capabilities than Telesat does. OneWeb has already launched dozens of satellites into its constellation and SpaceX has launched over one thousand satellites. Both have announced that they will continue to regularly launch satellites well in advance of when Telesat is expected to begin deploying significant numbers of additional satellites as part of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. SpaceX has its own in-house launch capability. Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon\u2019s Chairman, current CEO and largest shareholder, Jeff Bezos, is significantly advanced in its development of launch vehicles. Each of Amazon\u2019s and SpaceX\u2019s greater access to launch vehicles for its own satellites may give it an advantage over Telesat since Telesat does not have in-house capability to launch its own satellites. In the event SpaceX or Blue Origin do not make their launch vehicles available to Telesat, Telesat\u2019s access to economically feasible launch vehicles for the Telesat Lightspeed constellation may be limited.\nAdditionally, some of Telesat\u2019s competitors are already providing beta service on their LEO constellations and Telesat believes Telesat will not be the first LEO constellation to market. If Telesat\u2019s competitors are able to establish operational constellations before Telesat does, it may be more difficult for Telesat to attract customers for its constellation. Further, to the extent that their constellations make use of Ka-band spectrum, as SpaceX and OneWeb have indicated they will, it may limit Telesat\u2019s access to sufficient Ka-band spectrum to operate the Telesat Lightspeed constellation efficiently and profitably. Telesat also anticipates that Telesat will compete with OneWeb, SpaceX, Amazon and other developers of NGSO satellite projects for human capital, and Telesat\u2019s failure to recruit and retain a workforce capable of developing and deploying the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation may cause Telesat to fail to successfully monetize the Telesat Lightspeed constellation.\nIf successfully implemented, the Telesat Lightspeed constellation may decrease demand for Telesat\u2019s other satellite services. Beyond the risk that the Telesat Lightspeed constellation decreases demand for Telesat\u2019s existing services, Telesat faces competition in the GEO and medium earth orbit segments, and Telesat\u2019s failure to compete in these markets could result in a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nThere are numerous risks related to monetizing C-band spectrum, and Telesat may not be able to do so in a timely way or at all.\nOn February 28, 2020, in the U.S., the FCC approved its Report and Order on Expanding Flexible use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz band, which Report and Order was released on March 3, 2020. The Report and Order indicated that Telesat could receive as much as $344.4 million from the repurposing of C-band spectrum. Telesat must take the necessary steps, as proscribed by the Report and Order, to clear the 3700 - 4000 MHz spectrum so that it can be used for 5G without interfering with those who will continue to receive C-band signals from Telesat\u2019s satellites. If Telesat is unable to fulfill this condition, Telesat would not be entitled to any proceeds.\nOn August 27, 2020, ISED launched a public consultation on a similar repurposing of C-band spectrum in Canada. In the consultation document, the Canadian government put forward a proposal to repurpose 60% of C-band spectrum for 5G and rural broadband where the satellite operators would not receive any compensation. The Canadian government included a proposal put forward by Telesat, whereby - as the sole C-band licensee in Canada - Telesat would accelerate the clearing of 60% of C-band spectrum for 5G and be fully responsible for the clearing of the spectrum. In return, Telesat would receive a license for 3700-3900 MHz, which Telesat would sell to the wireless carriers. Comments were submitted to the Canadian government on October 26, 2020 and Reply Comments were submitted on November 30, 2020. Telesat anticipates a decision in 2021. There is no guarantee Telesat will receive any proceeds or funding through this spectrum proceeding in Canada.\nThe actual orbital maneuver lives of Telesat\u2019s satellites may be shorter than Telesat anticipates, and Telesat may be required to reduce available capacity on its satellites prior to the end of their orbital maneuver lives.\nFor all but one of Telesat\u2019s GEO satellites, the current expected end-of-orbital maneuver life date goes beyond the manufacturer\u2019s end-of-service life date. A number of factors will affect the actual commercial service lives of Telesat\u2019s satellites, including: the amount of propellant used in maintaining the satellite\u2019s orbital location or relocating the satellite to a new orbital location (and, for newly-launched satellites, the amount of propellant used during orbit raising following launch); the durability and quality of their construction; the performance of their components; conditions in space such as solar flares and space debris; operational considerations, including operational failures and other anomalies; and changes in technology which may make all or a portion of Telesat\u2019s satellite fleet obsolete.\nTelesat has been forced to remove satellites from service prematurely in the past due to an unexpected reduction in their previously anticipated end-of-orbital maneuver life. It is possible that the actual orbital maneuver lives of one or more of Telesat\u2019s existing satellites may also be shorter than originally anticipated. Further, on some of Telesat\u2019s satellites it is anticipated that the total available payload capacity may need to be reduced prior to the satellite reaching its end-of-orbital maneuver life.\nTelesat periodically reviews the expected orbital maneuver life of each of its satellites using current engineering data. A reduction in the orbital maneuver life of any of Telesat\u2019s satellites could result in a reduction of the revenues generated by that satellite, the recognition of an impairment loss and an acceleration of capital expenditures. To the extent Telesat is required to reduce the available payload capacity prior to the end of a satellite\u2019s orbital maneuver life, its revenues from the satellite would be reduced.\nTelesat\u2019s insurance will not protect it against all satellite-related losses. Further, Telesat may not be able to renew insurance on its existing satellites or obtain insurance on future satellites on acceptable terms or at all, and, for certain of Telesat\u2019s existing satellites, Telesat has elected to forego obtaining insurance.\nTelesat\u2019s current satellite insurance does not protect it against all satellite-related losses that it may experience, and it does not have in-orbit insurance coverage for all of the satellites in its fleet. As of December 31, 2020, the total net book value of Telesat\u2019s five in-orbit GEO satellites for which it does not have insurance (Nimiq 1, Nimiq 2, Anik, AnikR, and ViaSat-1) was approximately CAD 23.3 million. Telesat\u2019s insurance does not protect it against business interruption, loss of revenues or delay of revenues. Telesat\u2019s existing launch and in-orbit insurance policies include specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations, and future insurance policies are expected to continue to include such features. Typically, these insurance policies exclude coverage for damage or losses arising from acts of war, anti-satellite devices, electromagnetic or radio frequency interference and other similar potential risks for which exclusions are customary in the industry at the time the policy is written. In addition, they typically exclude coverage for satellite health-related problems affecting Telesat\u2019s satellites that are known at the time the policy is written or renewed. Any claims under existing policies are subject to settlement with the insurers and may, in some instances, be payable to Telesat\u2019s customers.\nThe price, terms and availability of satellite insurance has fluctuated significantly in recent years. These fluctuations may be affected by recent satellite launch or in-orbit failures and general conditions in the insurance industry. Launch and in-orbit policies on satellites may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. To the extent Telesat experiences a launch or in-orbit failure that is not fully insured, or for which insurance proceeds are delayed or disputed, it may not have sufficient resources to replace the affected satellite. In addition, higher premiums on insurance policies increase Telesat\u2019s costs, thereby reducing its profitability. Future insurance policies may also have higher deductibles, shorter coverage periods, higher loss percentages required for constructive total loss claims and additional satellite health-related policy exclusions, all of which would reduce Telesat\u2019s expected profitability. There can be no assurance that, upon the expiration of an in-orbit insurance policy, which typically has a term of one year, Telesat will be able to renew the policy on terms acceptable to it.\nTelesat may elect to reduce or eliminate insurance coverage for certain of its existing satellites, or elect not to obtain insurance policies for its future satellites, especially if exclusions make such policies ineffective, the costs of coverage make such insurance impractical or if self-insurance is deemed more cost effective.\nTelesat derives a substantial amount of its revenues from only a few of its customers. A loss of, or default by, one or more of these major customers, or a material adverse change in any such customer\u2019s business or financial condition, could materially reduce Telesat\u2019s future revenues and contracted backlog.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Telesat\u2019s top five customers together accounted for approximately 63% of Telesat\u2019s revenues. At December 31, 2020, Telesat\u2019s top five backlog customers together accounted for approximately 89% of its backlog. If any of Telesat\u2019s major customers chooses not to renew its contract or contracts at the expiration of the existing terms or seeks to negotiate concessions, particularly on price, it could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. Telesat\u2019s customers could experience a downturn in their business or find themselves in financial difficulties, which could result in their ceasing or reducing their use of Telesat\u2019s services or becoming unable to pay for services they had contracted to buy. In addition, some of Telesat\u2019s customers\u2019 industries are undergoing significant consolidation, and Telesat\u2019s customers may be acquired by each other or other companies, including by Telesat\u2019s competitors. Such acquisitions could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to sell services to such customers and to any end-users whom they serve. Some customers have in the past defaulted, and Telesat\u2019s customers may in the future default, on their obligations to Telesat due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Such defaults could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s revenues, operating margins and cash flows. If Telesat\u2019s contracted revenue backlog is reduced due to the financial difficulties of its customers, Telesat\u2019s revenues, operating margins and cash flows would be further negatively impacted.\nTelesat\u2019s business is capital intensive and Telesat may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance its business strategies, or Telesat may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict its ability to operate its business.\nImplementation of Telesat\u2019s business strategy requires a substantial outlay of capital. As Telesat pursues its business strategies and seeks to respond to developments in its business and opportunities and trends in its industry, its actual capital expenditures may differ from its expected capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that Telesat will be able to satisfy its capital requirements in the future. In addition, if one of Telesat\u2019s satellites failed unexpectedly, there can be no assurance of insurance recovery or the timing thereof and Telesat may need to exhaust or significantly draw upon its amended revolving credit facility or obtain additional financing to replace the satellite. If Telesat determines that it needs to obtain additional funds through external financing and is unable to do so, Telesat may be prevented from fully implementing its business strategy.\nThe availability and cost to Telesat of external financing depend on a number of factors, including its credit rating and financial performance and general market conditions. Telesat\u2019s ability to obtain financing generally may be influenced by the supply and demand characteristics of the telecommunications sector in general and of the satellite services sector in particular. Declines in Telesat\u2019s expected future revenues under contracts with customers and challenging business conditions faced by its customers are among the other factors that may adversely affect Telesat\u2019s credit and access to the capital markets. Other factors that could impact Telesat\u2019s credit rating include the amount of debt in its current or future capital structure, activities associated with strategic initiatives, the health of its satellites, the success or failure of its planned launches, its expected future cash flows and the capital expenditures required to execute its business strategy. The overall impact on Telesat\u2019s financial condition of any transaction that it pursues may be negative or may be negatively perceived by the financial markets and rating agencies and may result in adverse rating agency actions with respect to its credit rating and access to the capital markets. Long-term disruptions in the capital or credit markets as a result of uncertainty or recession, changing or increased regulation or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s access to capital. A credit rating downgrade or deterioration in Telesat\u2019s financial performance or general market conditions could limit its ability to obtain financing or could result in any such financing being available only at greater cost or on more restrictive terms than might otherwise be available and, in either case, could result in Telesat deferring or reducing capital expenditures, including on new or replacement satellites.\nTelesat\u2019s satellite launches may be delayed, it may suffer launch failures or its satellites may fail to reach their planned orbital locations. Any such issue could result in the loss of a satellite or cause significant delays in the deployment of the satellite which could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nDelays in launching satellites and in the deployment of satellites are not uncommon and result from construction delays, the unavailability of reliable launch opportunities with suppliers, delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals and launch failures. If satellite construction schedules are not met, a launch opportunity may not be available at the time the satellite is ready to be launched. Satellites are also subject to certain risks related to failed launches. Launch vehicles may fail. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need to construct replacement satellites, which typically takes up to 30 months or longer, and to obtain another launch vehicle. A delay or perceived delay in launching a satellite, or replacing a satellite, may cause Telesat\u2019s current customers to move to another satellite provider if they determine that the delay may cause an interruption in continuous service. In addition, Telesat\u2019s contracts with customers who purchase or reserve satellite capacity may allow the customers to terminate their contracts in the event of a delay. Any such termination would require Telesat to refund any prepayment it may have received, and would result in a reduction in Telesat\u2019s contracted backlog and would delay or prevent Telesat from securing the commercial benefits of the new satellite. Launch vehicles may also underperform, in which case the satellite may be lost or, if it can be placed into service by using its onboard propulsion systems to reach the desired orbit or orbital location, will have a shorter useful life. Any launch failure, underperformance, delay or perceived delay could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nBecause Telesat\u2019s satellites are complex and are deployed in complex environments, Telesat\u2019s satellites may have defects that are discovered only after full deployment, which could seriously harm Telesat\u2019s business.\nTelesat produces highly complex satellites that incorporate leading-edge technology. Telesat\u2019s products are complex and are designed to be deployed across complex networks, which in some cases may include over a million users. Because of the nature of these satellites, there is no assurance that Telesat\u2019s pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects. As a result, Telesat\u2019s customers may discover errors or defects in Telesat\u2019s satellites, or Telesat\u2019s satellites may not operate as expected after they have been fully deployed. If Telesat is unable to cure an anomaly, Telesat could experience damage to Telesat\u2019s reputation, reduced customer satisfaction, loss of existing customers and failure to attract new customers, failure to achieve market acceptance, cancellation of orders, loss of revenues, reduction in backlog and market share, increased service and warranty costs, diversion of development resources, legal actions by Telesat\u2019s customers, issuance of credit to customers and increased insurance costs. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in Telesat\u2019s satellites could also result in financial or other damages to Telesat\u2019s customers. Telesat\u2019s customers could seek damages for related losses from Telesat, which could seriously harm Telesat\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of these problems would seriously harm Telesat\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations\nSpectrum values historically have been volatile, which could cause the value of Telesat\u2019s business to fluctuate.\nA material amount of Telesat\u2019s asset value is derived from Telesat\u2019s spectrum authorizations. Valuations of spectrum in other frequency bands historically have been volatile, and Telesat cannot predict any future change in the value of Telesat\u2019s spectrum and other assets. In addition, to the extent that the ITU or any governmental authority takes action that makes additional spectrum available or promotes the more flexible use or greater availability of existing satellite or terrestrial spectrum allocations, for example, by means of spectrum leasing or new spectrum sales, the availability of such additional spectrum could reduce the value of Telesat\u2019s spectrum authorizations and, as a result, the value of Telesat\u2019s business.\nTelesat operates in a highly regulated industry and government regulations may adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to sell Telesat\u2019s services, or increase the expense of such services or otherwise limit Telesat\u2019s ability to operate or grow Telesat\u2019s business.\nTelesat operates satellites that have been licensed by either Canada, the U.S. or Brazil. As a global satellite operator, Telesat has been granted authorization (sometimes referred to as \u201cmarket access\u201d) to provide services in many countries around the world, while in other countries there is no formal authorization requirement (sometimes referred to as \u201cOpen Skies\u201d). Therefore, Telesat is subject to regulation by government authorities in Canada, the U.S. and Brazil, and other countries in which Telesat operates.\nIn Canada, operations are subject to regulation and licensing by ISED pursuant to the Radiocommunication Act (Canada), and by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (\u201cCRTC\u201d) under the Telecommunications Act (Canada). Certain of Telesat\u2019s satellites are licensed by Canada. This includes the GSO Anik satellites,R,, and, the GSO Nimiq satellites 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, and the NGSO Telesat Lightspeed constellation. ISED has the authority to issue licenses for the frequencies used by Canadian satellite systems, issue earth station licenses, and establish policies and standards upon which Telesat\u2019s satellites and earth stations depend. The Minister responsible for ISED has broad discretion in exercising this authority to issue licenses, establish and amend conditions of licenses, and to suspend or even revoke them. The CRTC implements the broadcasting policy for Canada and can direct the allocation of satellite capacity to particular broadcasting undertakings. Telesat is required to pay \u201cuniversal service\u201d charges in Canada and have certain research and development and public benefits obligations that do not apply to other satellite operators with which Telesat competes. These obligations could change at any time. With respect to market access, ISED maintains a list of foreign satellites approved to provide FSS in Canada. Telesat\u2019s Telstar 11N, Telstar 12 VANTAGE, Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 and Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites are currently authorized to serve the Canadian market in accordance with these procedures.\nIn the U.S., the FCC regulates the provision of satellite services to, from or within the U.S. Certain of Telesat\u2019s satellites are owned and operated through a U.S. subsidiary and are regulated by the FCC. This includes Telstar 11N and Telstar 12 VANTAGE. With respect to market access, operators may apply to have their satellites either placed on the FCC\u2019s Permitted Space Station List (for certain frequencies) or be granted a declaratory ruling (for other frequencies). Telesat\u2019s Anik FlR, Anik, Anik, Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 and Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites are currently authorized to serve the U.S. market in accordance with these procedures, and Telstar 18 VANTAGE has access to the U.S. market through an earth station authorization. The Telesat Lightspeed constellation has also been granted U.S. market access.\nIn Brazil, the national telecommunications agency, ANATEL, regulates the granting of exploitation and landing rights to the operation of Brazilian and foreign satellites and their use to transport telecommunication signals. Certain of Telesat\u2019s satellites are operated through a Brazilian subsidiary and are regulated by ANATEL pursuant to Concession Agreements. This includes Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 and Telstar 19 VANTAGE. With respect to market access ANATEL has also accredited the provision of service by foreign operators. Telesat\u2019s Telstar 12 VANTAGE and Anik G1 satellites are currently authorized to serve the Brazil market in accordance with these procedures.\nTelstar 18 VANTAGE operates at the 138\u00b0 EL orbital location under agreements with APT, which has been granted the right to use frequencies at the 138\u00b0 EL orbital location by The Kingdom of Tonga. The ViaSat-1 satellite at the 115\u00b0 WL orbital location, which has been granted the right to use frequencies at the 115\u00b0 WL orbital location by the United Kingdom regulatory agency, OFCOM, includes a payload that Telesat owns and operates. The rights to use certain frequencies on Telstar 12 VANTAGE, Telstar 18 VANTAGE and Telstar 19 VANTAGE have also been granted by OFCOM.\nIn addition to regulatory requirements governing the use of frequencies, most countries regulate transmission of signals to and from their territory, and Telesat is required to obtain and maintain authorizations to carry on business in the countries in which Telesat operates.\nIf Telesat fails to obtain or maintain particular authorizations on acceptable terms, such failure could delay or prevent Telesat from offering some or all of Telesat\u2019s services and adversely affect results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. In particular, Telesat may not be able to obtain all of the required regulatory authorizations for the construction, launch and operation of any of Telesat\u2019s future satellites, for the spectrum for these satellites and for Telesat\u2019s ground infrastructure, on acceptable terms or at all. Even if Telesat is able to obtain the necessary authorizations, the licenses Telesat obtains may impose significant operational restrictions, or not protect it from interference that could affect the use of satellites. Countries or their regulatory authorities may adopt new laws, policies or regulations, or change their interpretation of existing laws, policies or regulations, that could cause Telesat\u2019s existing authorizations to be changed or cancelled, require Telesat to incur additional costs, impose or change existing pricing, or otherwise adversely affect operations or revenues. As a result, any currently held regulatory authorizations are subject to rescission and renewal and may not remain sufficient or additional authorizations may be necessary that Telesat may not be able to obtain on a timely basis or on terms that are not unduly costly or burdensome. Further, because the regulatory schemes vary by country, Telesat may be subject to regulations in foreign countries with which Telesat is not presently aware that it is not in compliance, and as a result could be subject to sanctions by a foreign government.\nIn a number of countries, regulators are considering and may adopt new spectrum allocations for terrestrial mobile broadband and 5G, including in bands that are currently allocated to satellite services. New spectrum allocations may require satellite operators to vacate or share spectrum and may limit the spectrum that is available for satellite services, which could adversely impact Telesat\u2019s business.\nThe export from the U.S. of satellites and technical information related to satellites, earth station equipment and provision of services to certain countries are subject to Department of State, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury regulations, in particular the ITAR, which currently include satellites on the list of items requiring export permits. These ITAR provisions may constrain Telesat\u2019s access to technical information and may have a negative impact on Telesat\u2019s international consulting revenues. In addition, Telesat and Telesat\u2019s satellite manufacturers may not be able to obtain and maintain necessary export authorizations, which could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to procure new U.S.-manufactured satellites; control existing satellites; acquire launch services; obtain insurance and pursue Telesat\u2019s rights under insurance policies; or conduct Telesat\u2019s satellite-related operations and consulting activities.\nThe planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation will depend on the use of spectrum; regulations governing NGSO spectrum rights, including requirements to share spectrum, remain uncertain and could materially impact the Telesat Lightspeed constellation\u2019s system capacity.\nIn order to operate the Telesat Lightspeed constellation efficiently and in a commercially viable manner, Telesat will require access to a sufficient amount of spectrum. Telesat currently holds an authorization from Canada for an NGSO network in Ka-band. However, the regulatory framework relating to NGSO spectrum rights is not fully specified. Some of the international and domestic regulations governing NGSO satellites are undergoing revision or have yet to be established. Canada, the U.S. and the ITU have adopted deployment milestones for NGSO systems. These milestones could adversely impact Telesat\u2019s ability to maintain the priority of Telesat\u2019s rights for the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation and could affect Telesat\u2019s ability to maintain authorizations or lead to restrictions on the number of satellites Telesat is permitted to operate under these authorizations.\nIn addition, while the international rules governing coordination between satellite systems are well established and rely on international filing date priority, the U.S. has adopted a different approach to NGSO-NGSO coordination that requires band splitting during in-line interference events if NGSO operators are unable to reach a coordination agreement. As a result, the amount of spectrum that may be available to Telesat for Telesat\u2019s Telesat Lightspeed constellation in the U.S. is uncertain. It is possible that other jurisdictions may adopt the U.S. approach. Some of the spectrum utilized by the Telesat Lightspeed constellation is also allocated to terrestrial fixed and mobile services and GSO satellite services. Other portions of the spectrum Telesat plans to use are under consideration for being designated or have been designated for terrestrial fixed and mobile services. While some jurisdictions have established rules for sharing the spectrum, many jurisdictions have yet to address this issue. In addition, even under the international rules governing coordination between satellite systems, while the process for sharing spectrum is well established with respect to GSO systems, it is only now being implemented for the first time for large, broadband NGSO systems. Because the coordination of NGSO systems is both highly technically complex and new, uncertainties exist about spectrum sharing, which may limit Telesat\u2019s ability to operate and hence monetize the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. Consequently, Telesat\u2019s ability to use shared spectrum for the Telesat Lightspeed constellation may be adversely impacted by new rules, the implementation of existing rules or the absence of rules for spectrum sharing.\nIn order to successfully sell services on the Telesat Lightspeed constellation, Telesat will require market access to each country in which Telesat\u2019s customers are located. It is uncertain if Telesat will be successful in obtaining market access to all of the countries needed to make the Telesat Lightspeed constellation commercially successful.\nThere are certain environmental risks that have been raised in opposition to LEO constellations, including the potential for increased orbital debris and \u201clight pollution\u201d associated with light reflecting off satellites in the night sky. To the extent that governments impose restrictions or additional regulations to address any environmental concerns regarding LEO constellations, it may adversely impact Telesat\u2019s ability to successfully deploy the Telesat Lightspeed constellation.\nReplacing a satellite upon the end of its service life will require Telesat to make significant expenditures and may require Telesat to obtain shareholder approval and Telesat may choose not to, or be unable to, replace some of Telesat\u2019s satellites upon their end of life.\nTo ensure no disruption in Telesat\u2019s GEO business and to prevent loss of its customers, Telesat will be required to commence construction of a replacement satellite approximately five years prior to the expected end of service life of the satellite then in orbit. Typically, the construction, launch and insurance of a GEO satellite costs in the range of $250 million to $300 million. There can be no assurance that Telesat will have sufficient cash, cash flow or be able to obtain third-party or shareholder financing to fund such expenditures on favorable terms, if at all, or that Telesat will obtain shareholder approval to procure replacement satellites.\nCertain of Telesat\u2019s satellites are nearing their expected end-of-orbital maneuver lives. Should Telesat not have sufficient funds available to replace those satellites or should Telesat not receive approval from its shareholders to purchase replacement satellites, it could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. In order to justify the cost of replacing a satellite at the end of its life, there must be sufficient demand for services, and sufficient spectrum available to Telesat to provide those services, such that a reasonable business case can be made for its replacement. If there is insufficient demand for a replacement, or if Telesat does not have sufficient spectrum available to it as a result of the repurposing of C-band spectrum for terrestrial use or otherwise, Telesat may choose not to replace a satellite at the end of its life.\nTelesat may experience a failure of ground operations infrastructure or interference with its satellite signals that impairs the commercial performance of, or the services delivered over, its satellites or the satellites of other operators for whom it provides ground services, which could result in a material loss of revenues.\nTelesat operates an extensive ground infrastructure including a satellite control center in Ottawa, Ontario, its main earth station and back up satellite control facility at Allan Park, Ontario, nine earth stations throughout Canada, one teleport located in the United States and one in Brazil. These ground facilities are used for controlling Telesat\u2019s satellites and/or for the provision of end-to-end services to Telesat\u2019s customers.\nTelesat may experience a partial or total loss of one or more of these facilities due to natural disasters (tornado, flood, hurricane or other such acts of God), fire, acts of war or terrorism or other catastrophic events. A failure at any of these facilities would cause a significant loss of service for Telesat customers. Additionally, Telesat may experience a failure in the necessary equipment at the satellite control center, at the back-up facility, or in the communications links between these facilities and remote earth station facilities. A failure or operator error affecting tracking, telemetry and control operations might lead to a breakdown in the ability to communicate with one or more satellites or cause the transmission of incorrect instructions to the affected satellite(s), which could lead to a temporary or permanent degradation in satellite performance or to the loss of one or more satellites. Intentional or non-intentional electromagnetic or radio frequency interference could result in a failure of Telesat\u2019s ability to deliver satellite services to its customers. A failure at any of Telesat\u2019s facilities or in the communications links between its facilities or interference with its satellite signal could cause its revenues and backlog to decline materially and could adversely affect its ability to market its services and generate future revenues and profit.\nTelesat purchases equipment from third-party suppliers and depends on those suppliers to deliver, maintain and support these products to the contracted specifications in order for Telesat to meet its service commitments to its customers. Telesat may experience difficulty if these suppliers do not meet their obligations to deliver and support this equipment. Telesat may also experience difficulty or failure when implementing, operating and maintaining this equipment, or when providing services using this equipment. This difficulty or failure may lead to delays in implementing services, service interruptions or degradations in service, which could cause Telesat\u2019s revenues and backlog to decline materially and could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s ability to market its services and generate future revenues and profit.\nTelesat\u2019s operations may be limited or precluded by ITU rules or processes, and Telesat is required to coordinate Telesat\u2019s operations with those of other satellite operators.\nThe ITU, a specialized United Nations agency, regulates the global allocation of radio frequency spectrum and the registration of radio frequency assignments at any associated satellite orbit. Telesat participates in the activities of the ITU; however, only national administrations have full standing as ITU members. Consequently, Telesat must rely on the relevant government administrations to represent Telesat\u2019s interests.\nAccess to the radio frequency spectrum is governed by the ITU Radio Regulations, established in accordance with an international treaty, which contains the rules concerning frequency allocations and the procedure to obtain rights to use radio frequency assignments. The ITU Radio Regulations are periodically reviewed and revised at World Radiocommunication Conferences (\u201cWRC\u201d), which take place typically every three to four years. Terrestrial operators are increasingly seeking additional radio frequency assignments, including frequencies currently designated for exclusive or shared use by satellite systems, to support the increasing demand for terrestrial services. As a result, Telesat cannot guarantee that the ITU will not change its allocation decisions and rules in the future in a way that could limit or preclude Telesat\u2019s use of some or all of Telesat\u2019s existing or future spectrum.\nThe ITU Radio Regulations define the coordination, notification and recording procedures to obtain rights to use frequencies, including those frequencies used by Telesat\u2019s GEO satellites, and the planned Telesat Lightspeed constellation. In most of the frequency bands used or intended to be used by Telesat, a \u201cfirst-come, first-served\u201d procedure applies among geostationary orbit (\u201cGSO\u201d) systems or among NGSO systems where by earlier-registered satellite systems are protected from interference due to later-registered satellite systems. Between NGSO and GSO, in some cases NGSO must protect GSO and in some cases a \u201cfirst-come, first-served\u201d procedure applies. In order to comply with these rules, Telesat must coordinate the operation of Telesat\u2019s satellites, including any replacement satellite that has performance characteristics that are different from those of the satellite it replaces, with other satellites. This process requires potentially lengthy and costly negotiations with parties who operate or intend to operate satellites that could affect or be affected by Telesat\u2019s satellites.\nIn certain countries, a failure to resolve coordination issues is used by regulators as a justification to limit or condition market access by foreign satellite operators. In addition, while the ITU Radio Regulations require later-in-time systems to coordinate their operations with Telesat\u2019s, Telesat cannot guarantee that other operators will conduct their operations so as to avoid transmitting any signals that would cause harmful interference to the signals that Telesat, or Telesat\u2019s customers, transmit. In the extreme, this interference could require Telesat to take steps, or pay or refund amounts to customers that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. The ITU\u2019s Radio Regulations do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement regulations and neither the ITU specifically, nor international law generally, provides clear remedies if the ITU coordination process fails. Failure to coordinate Telesat\u2019s satellites\u2019 frequencies successfully or to obtain or maintain other required regulatory approvals could have an adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition, as well as on the value of Telesat\u2019s business.\nIf Telesat does not make use of Telesat\u2019s spectrum rights by specified deadlines, or does not continue to use the spectrum rights Telesat currently uses, these rights may become available for other satellite operators to use.\nTelesat\u2019s in-orbit satellites do not currently occupy all of the GSO locations for which Telesat has obtained spectrum authorizations. In some cases, Telesat\u2019s satellite that occupies a GSO location is not designed to use all of the frequency spectrum for which Telesat has been authorized. Similarly, Telesat has been granted regulatory authorizations for certain spectrum in NGSO orbits that are not yet occupied at all or in which the full complement of satellites has not yet been deployed.\nIn accordance with the ITU Radio Regulations, governments have rights to use radio frequencies assignments at certain GSO orbital locations and in NGSO orbits. Certain of these governments have in turn authorized Telesat to use these radio frequency assignments. Under the ITU Radio Regulations, Telesat must bring into use (\u201cBIU\u201d) these frequency assignments within a fixed period of time, or the governments in question would lose their international priority rights, and the frequencies at the GSO orbital location or in the NGSO orbit likely would become available for use by another satellite operator. In addition to ITU requirements, the governments that have authorized Telesat to use these orbital resources have generally conditioned such use on Telesat meeting certain milestones, including making use of the spectrum by a specified time.\nIf Telesat is unable to place satellites at GSO locations or into NGSOs in a manner that satisfies the ITU Radio Regulations and national regulatory requirements, or if the ITU or national regulatory requirements were to change, or if Telesat is unable to maintain satellites or make use of all of the spectrum for which Telesat has been authorized at the GSO locations that Telesat currently uses, Telesat may lose Telesat\u2019s rights to use these orbital resources and they would become available for other satellite operators to use. The loss of one or more of Telesat\u2019s orbital resources could negatively affect Telesat\u2019s plans and ability to implement Telesat\u2019s business strategy.\nTelesat needs to modify the authorizations from Canada and the U.S. for Telesat Lightspeed and there is no guarantee that Canadian and U.S. authorities will approve such modifications.\nThe parameters of Telesat\u2019s current Ka-band Telesat Lightspeed constellation design align with the parameters of the spectrum license from Canada; however, it may be necessary to amend the milestones in the conditions of license. There is no assurance that such amendment request would be approved. The parameters of Telesat\u2019s current Ka-band Telesat Lightspeed constellation design differ from the parameters of the market access grant from the U.S. Telesat applied on May 26, 2020 to modify Telesat\u2019s U.S. market access grant to match the parameters of Telesat\u2019s final Ka-band Telesat Lightspeed constellation design. There is no assurance that the modification will be approved or, if approved, that it will not have conditions that preclude Telesat from being able to deliver an acceptable level of service in the U.S.\nTelesat\u2019s failure to maintain or obtain authorizations under and comply with the U.S. export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nThe export of satellites and technical data related to satellites, earth station equipment and provision of services are subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws, implemented by regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of State, Department of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. If Telesat does not maintain its existing authorizations or obtain necessary future authorizations under the export control laws and regulations of the United States, it may be unable to export technical data or equipment to non-U.S. persons and companies, including to Telesat\u2019s own non-U.S. employees, as required to fulfill existing contracts. If Telesat does not maintain its existing authorizations or obtain necessary future authorizations under the trade sanctions laws and regulations of the United States, it may not be able to provide satellite capacity and related administrative services to certain countries subject to U.S. sanctions. Telesat\u2019s ability to acquire new United States-manufactured satellites, procure launch services and launch new satellites, operate existing satellites, obtain insurance and pursue its rights under insurance policies or conduct its satellite-related operations and consulting activities could also be negatively affected if Telesat and its suppliers are not able to obtain and maintain required U.S. export authorizations.\nIf Telesat does not obtain required security clearances from, and comply with any agreements entered into with, the U.S. Department of Defense, or if Telesat does not comply with U.S. law, Telesat may not be able to continue to sell Telesat\u2019s LEO services to the U.S. government.\nTo participate in classified U.S. government programs, Telesat may seek and obtain security clearances for one or more of Telesat\u2019s subsidiaries from the U.S. Department of Defense. Given Telesat\u2019s foreign domestication, Telesat may be required to enter into one or more agreements with the U.S. government that may limit Telesat\u2019s ability to control the operations of this subsidiary, as required under the national security laws and regulations of the U.S. If Telesat does not obtain these security clearances, Telesat\u2019s ability to sell LEO services to the U.S. government will be limited. As a result, Telesat\u2019s business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe content of third-party transmissions over Telesat\u2019s satellites may affect Telesat since Telesat could be subject to sanctions by various governmental entities for the transmission of certain content.\nTelesat provides satellite capacity for transmissions by third parties. Telesat does not decide what content is transmitted over its satellites, although its contracts generally provide it with rights to prohibit certain types of content or to cease transmission or permit Telesat to require its customers to cease their transmissions under certain circumstances. A governmental body or other entity may object to some of the content carried over Telesat\u2019s satellites, such as \u201cadult services\u201d video channels or content deemed political in nature. Issues arising from the content of transmissions by these third parties over Telesat\u2019s satellites could affect Telesat\u2019s future revenues, operations or its relationship with certain governments or customers.\nReductions in government spending could reduce demand for Telesat\u2019s services.\nGovernments, in particular the U.S. government, purchase a substantial amount of satellite services from commercial satellite operators, including Telesat. Spending authorizations for defense-related and other programs by the U.S. government have fluctuated in the past, and future levels of expenditures and authorizations for these programs may decrease, remain constant or shift to programs in areas where Telesat does not currently provide services. To the extent the U.S. government and its agencies reduce spending on commercial satellite services, this could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s revenue and operating margins. Many governments provide funding for satellite services that are used to provide broadband connectivity to rural and remote communities and those with limited terrestrial infrastructure. To the extent these governments reduce spending on satellite services, as a result of the need to reduce overall spending during periods of fiscal restraint, to reduce budget deficits or otherwise, demand for Telesat\u2019s services could decrease which could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s revenue, the prices it is able to charge for services and its results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nTelesat is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.\nTelesat\u2019s operations internationally are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business globally. Telesat is subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While Telesat\u2019s employees and contractors are required to comply with these laws, Telesat cannot be sure that its internal policies and procedures will always protect it from violations of these laws, despite Telesat\u2019s commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect Telesat\u2019s business, performance, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact Telesat\u2019s operating results.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on Telesat\u2019s variable rate debt, including Telesat\u2019s revolving credit facility, term loan, and interest rate swaps is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021, when private-sector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate. Without this data, LIBOR may no longer be published, or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market. As of December 31, 2020, Telesat has outstanding $1,552.8 million of indebtedness that matures after 2021 and includes LIBOR as a reference rate. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although the U.S. Federal Reserve, in connection with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of large U.S. financial institutions selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the rate that represents best practice for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR for use in new U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts, and has recommended a paced transition plan that involves the creation of a reference rate based on SOFR by the end of 2021. SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Although there have been debt issuances utilizing SOFR, it is unknown whether it will attain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the cessation of LIBOR will be further delayed due to COVID-19 or what form any delay may take, and there are no assurances that there will be a delay. It is also unclear what the duration and severity of COVID-19 will be, and whether this will impact LIBOR transition planning. COVID-19 may also slow regulators\u2019 and others\u2019 efforts to develop and implement alternative reference rates, which could make LIBOR transition planning more difficult, particularly if the cessation of LIBOR is not delayed but an alternative reference rate does not emerge as industry standard. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including but not limited to the need to amend some or all contracts with LIBOR as the reference rate and how this will impact Telesat\u2019s cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments. Telesat will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language, as published by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of Telesat\u2019s variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments which may be detrimental to Telesat\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\nTelesat\u2019s dependence on outside contractors could result in delays related to the design, manufacture and launch of its new satellites, or could limit its ability to sell its services, which could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s operating results and prospects.\nAny delays in the design, construction or launch of Telesat\u2019s satellites could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. There are a limited number of manufacturers that are able to design and build satellites according to the technical specifications and standards of quality Telesat requires, including Airbus Defense and Space, Thales Alenia Space, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, MELCO, Orbital and Maxar. Telesat also relies on the manufacturers of its satellites to provide support throughout the life of the satellite in the event it should suffer an anomaly. If any of Telesat\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 businesses fail, it could adversely impact Telesat\u2019s ability to overcome a satellite anomaly and maintain its satellites in service, in whole or in part. There are also a limited number of suppliers able to launch such satellites, including International Launch Services, Arianespace, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, SpaceX and Lockheed Martin. Should any of Telesat\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 or launch suppliers\u2019 businesses fail, it would reduce competition and could increase the cost of satellites and launch services. Adverse events with respect to any of Telesat\u2019s manufacturers or launch suppliers could also result in the delay of the design, construction or launch of satellites.\nGeneral economic conditions may also affect the ability of Telesat\u2019s manufacturers and launch suppliers to provide services on commercially reasonable terms or to fulfill their obligations in terms of manufacturing schedules, launch dates, pricing or other items. Even where alternate suppliers for such services are available, Telesat may have difficulty identifying them in a timely manner, or may incur significant additional expense in changing suppliers, and this could result in difficulties or delays in the design, construction or launch of Telesat\u2019s satellites.\nTelesat\u2019s future reported net income and asset values could be adversely affected by impairments of the value of goodwill and intangible assets.\nThe assets listed on Telesat\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 include goodwill with a carrying value of approximately CAD 2.4 billion and other intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately CAD 217 million. Goodwill and other intangible assets are qualitatively assessed for indicators of impairment. If the qualitative assessment concludes an indication of impairment, a quantitative impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets (such as orbital locations) with indefinite useful lives is undertaken. Telesat measures for the quantitative impairment test using a projected discounted cash flow method and confirms the assessment using other valuation methods. If the asset\u2019s carrying value is more than its recoverable amount, the difference is recorded as a reduction in the amount of the asset on the balance sheet and an impairment charge in the statement of income. Quantitative testing for impairment requires significant judgment by management to determine the assumptions used in the impairment analysis. Any changes in the assumptions used could have a material impact on the impairment analysis and result in an impairment charge. Telesat cannot predict whether an event that triggers impairment will occur, when it will occur or how it will affect the reported asset values. If Telesat\u2019s goodwill or other intangible assets are deemed to be impaired in whole or in part, it could be required to reduce or write-off such assets, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.\nTelesat may pursue acquisitions, dispositions and strategic transactions which could result in the incurrence of additional costs, liabilities or expenses in connection with the implementation of such transactions.\nIn the future, Telesat may pursue acquisitions, dispositions and strategic transactions, which may include joint ventures and strategic relations, as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets. Acquisitions, dispositions and strategic transactions involve a number of risks, including: potential disruption of ongoing business; distraction of management; may result in Telesat being more leveraged; the anticipated benefits and cost savings of those transactions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected; increasing the scope and complexity of Telesat\u2019s operations; and loss or reduction of control over certain of Telesat\u2019s assets.\nThe presence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to Telesat at the time of acquisition could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, business prospects and financial condition. A strategic transaction may result in a significant change in the nature of Telesat\u2019s business, operations and strategy. In addition, Telesat may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in implementing a strategic transaction.\nTelesat continues to evaluate the performance of all of its businesses and may sell businesses or assets. Such a sale could include a strategic disposition of one or more of Telesat\u2019s satellites. In addition to the risks listed above that may occur with any acquisition, disposition or strategic transaction, a satellite divestiture could result in a loss of revenues or significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that Telesat will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered.\nIV. Other Risks\nThreats to public health, and measures taken in response to them, may have an adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s or our business and results of operations.\nTelesat\u2019s or our business and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the current outbreak of COVID-19, and by measures taken to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, cancellation of events, remote working, and closure of workplaces and other businesses. Telesat\u2019s or our business and results of operations may also be negatively impacted by the adverse effect that COVID-19 has had and may continue to have on global economic activity, which may include a period of prolonged global or regional economic slowdowns or recessions. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 is subject to change and dependent on many factors, including, among others, the duration of the pandemic, the success and timing of the vaccination rollout, and the measures that may be implemented by, or that may be imposed upon, us, Telesat and Telesat\u2019s customers and suppliers in response to the pandemic, and is therefore difficult to predict. COVID-19 could also impact Telesat\u2019s or our ability to attract capital to finance business strategies, such as the development of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation and related network, and also could increase Telesat\u2019s cost of borrowing.\nTelesat\u2019s customers in the maritime and aeronautical markets have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and measures implemented in response to it. At the request of some of these customers, Telesat has agreed to amend the terms of certain of their contracts to mitigate the adverse financial impact that COVID-19 is having on their respective businesses. Other Telesat customers may make similar request in the future and Telesat may enter into similar arrangements. The arrangements into which Telesat has entered, and into which Telesat may enter in the future, will have an adverse impact on Telesat\u2019s revenues in the near term. In addition, certain of Telesat\u2019s maritime and aeronautical customers commenced voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, Telesat had to record a provision for bad debt expense for certain accounts receivable with these customers given the risk that Telesat may not receive payment for all, or substantially all, of the amounts owed to it. Further, bankruptcy laws permit the party in bankruptcy to choose to reject any existing contracts into which they have entered. To the extent they choose to reject the contracts they have with Telesat, Telesat\u2019s customers\u2019 obligations under those contracts would be voided and Telesat\u2019s revenues would be adversely impacted. Moreover, Telesat may not be able to sell the resulting excess capacity on favorable terms, if at all. The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in some of Telesat\u2019s other customers entering into bankruptcy in the future, or otherwise defaulting on their obligations to pay for Telesat\u2019s services, including the customers to whom Telesat has provided contractual relief. In any of these circumstances, Telesat\u2019s revenues, operating income and cash flows would be negatively impacted.\nTelesat purchases equipment from third-party suppliers and depends on those suppliers to deliver, maintain and support these products to the contracted specifications in order to meet Telesat\u2019s service commitments to its customers. Additionally, Telesat is currently developing an advanced LEO constellation consisting of several hundred satellites in non-geostationary orbit. There are a limited number of manufacturers that are able to design and build satellites and ground terminals according to the technical specifications and standards of quality Telesat requires and a limited number of launch providers that are able to launch Telesat\u2019s satellites. If Telesat\u2019s suppliers do not meet their obligations to deliver and support their equipment due to operational challenges, temporary or permanent shut downs, severe financial hardship or bankruptcy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or disruptions in their own supply chains, Telesat\u2019s ability to meet its service commitments to its customers may be adversely affected and the design, construction or launch of the Telesat Lightspeed constellation or components of the network that support it may be delayed.\nTelesat\u2019s and our corporate headquarters and many of Telesat\u2019s other offices and facilities, are located in jurisdictions that instituted work from home and social distancing requirements. These restrictions adversely impacted the ability of Telesat\u2019s and our employees to travel to their places of work, and, in the case of Telesat employees, to customer locations and to supplier facilities. Telesat and we enacted work from home policies for our respective employees effective March 16, 2020, which in the case of Telesat are ongoing; in our case, although we have adopted a plan for re-opening of our office in accordance with local regulations and guidance, our employees are nevertheless encouraged to work, and are generally still working, remotely. Telesat has also implemented processes that allow for a minimum number of its employees to be present at Telesat\u2019s facilities, primarily in an attempt to further ensure that its satellite control and network operations are not impacted. To date, Telesat and we have maintained our respective operations without any known material adverse impact on operations. The future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Telesat and us are dependent on many factors, including, among others, the duration and severity of the pandemic, whether a significant number of Telesat\u2019s or our respective employees supporting critical operations were to contract COVID-19, whether the current measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 continue, and whether new restrictions are imposed; the extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Telesat\u2019s or our business and results of operations is, therefore, difficult to predict. In the event that Telesat\u2019s or our ability to operate our respective businesses is adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or by measures taken to prevent its spread, Telesat\u2019s revenue and Telesat\u2019s or our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nInterruption or failure of, or cyber-attacks on, Telesat\u2019s or our information technology and communications systems, data breaches, data theft, unauthorized access or hacking could materially hurt Telesat\u2019s or our reputation and ability to operate our respective businesses effectively, any of which could harm Telesat\u2019s or our business and operating results.\nTelesat\u2019s and our ability to operate our respective businesses depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of Telesat\u2019s and our information technology and communications systems, which are an integral part of Telesat\u2019s and our businesses. We and Telesat rely on our information and communications systems, as well as on software applications developed internally and externally to, among other things, effectively manage the accounting and financial functions, including maintaining internal controls, and, in the case of Telesat, operate Telesat\u2019s satellites and satellites for third parties, provide consulting services by Telesat to customers and transmit customer proprietary and/or confidential content and assist with other operations. An increasing number of companies have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their computer networks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we and Telesat may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. If unauthorized parties gain access to Telesat\u2019s or our information technology systems, they may be able to misappropriate assets, including confidential trade secrets and intellectual property assets, which, in the case of Telesat, could be used to compete against Telesat\u2019s business and otherwise adversely impact Telesat\u2019s competitive position. They could also access sensitive information (such as personally identifiable information of Telesat\u2019s customers and Telesat\u2019s and our business partners and employees (\u201cStakeholders\u201d)), cause interruption in Telesat\u2019s or our operations, cause corruption of data or computers, or otherwise damage Telesat\u2019s or our reputation and business. In such circumstances, we or Telesat could be held liable to our respective Stakeholders or other parties, or be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy rules.\nWhile we and Telesat continue to bolster systems with additional security measures, and, working with external experts, mitigate the risk of security breaches, systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, inclement weather, natural or man-made disasters, earthquakes, explosions, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, power loss, telecommunications or equipment failures, transportation interruptions, accidents or other disruptive events or attempts to harm our or Telesat\u2019s systems. In addition, Telesat\u2019s and our facilities are also potentially vulnerable to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Telesat\u2019s and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Telesat\u2019s or our business and operations could be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, operations are disrupted or shut down, confidential or proprietary information is stolen or disclosed, Telesat loses customers, costs are incurred or fines are required in connection with confidential or export-controlled information that is disclosed, significant resources are dedicated to system repairs or to increase cyber security protection or we or Telesat otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of any such event. A serious disruption to systems could significantly limit Telesat\u2019s or our ability to manage and operate Telesat\u2019s or our business efficiently, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s or our business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, any compromise of Telesat\u2019s or our security could result in a loss of confidence in Telesat\u2019s or our security measures, and subject us or Telesat to litigation, civil or criminal penalties, or negative publicity that could adversely affect Telesat\u2019s or our financial condition and results of operations.\nTelesat\u2019s profitability may be adversely affected by swings in the global financial markets, which may have a material adverse effect on Telesat\u2019s customers and suppliers.\nSwings in the global financial markets that include illiquidity, market volatility, changes in interest rates and currency exchange fluctuations can be difficult to predict and negatively affect the ability of certain customers to make payments when due. Such swings may materially and adversely affect us due to the potential insolvency of Telesat\u2019s suppliers and customers, inability of customers to obtain financing for their transponder leases, decreased customer demand, delays in supplier performance and contract terminations. Telesat\u2019s customers may not have access to capital or a willingness to spend capital on transponder leases, or their levels of cash liquidity with which to pay for transponder leases may be adversely affected. Access of Telesat\u2019s suppliers to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventories, production levels or product quality may be adversely affected, which could cause them to raise prices or cease operations. As a result, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These potential effects of swings in the global financial markets are difficult to forecast and mitigate.\nTelesat\u2019s financial results and our U.S. dollar reporting of Telesat\u2019s financial results will be affected by volatility in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate.\nPortions of Telesat\u2019s revenue and expenses and all of its debt are denominated in U.S. dollars and changes in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate may have a negative impact on Telesat\u2019s financial results and affect the ability of Telesat to repay or refinance its borrowings. Telesat\u2019s main currency exposures as of December 31, 2020 lie in its U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and indebtedness, with the most significant impact being on the U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness. In addition, approximately 53% of Telesat\u2019s revenues, 46% of its operating expenses, 100% of its interest expense and a majority of its capital expenditures for 2020 were denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2020, a five percent increase (decrease) in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar on financial assets and liabilities would have increased (decreased) Telesat\u2019s net income by approximately $124.6 million. This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.\nLoral reports its investment in Telesat using the equity method of accounting. Loral reports its investment in Telesat in U.S. dollars while Telesat reports its financial results in Canadian dollars. As a result, Telesat\u2019s results of operations are subject to conversion from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Changes in the U.S. dollar relationship to the Canadian dollar affect how Telesat\u2019s financial results are reported in our consolidated financial statements. During 2020, the exchange rate moved from U.S. $1.00/CAD 1.2990 at December 31, 2019 to U.S. $1.00/CAD 1.2725 at December 31, 2020.\nThe soundness of financial institutions and counterparties could adversely affect Telesat or us.\nWe and Telesat have exposure to many different financial institutions and counterparties (including those under credit, financing and insurance arrangements), including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance providers and other institutions and industry participants. We and Telesat are exposed to risk, including credit risk resulting from many of the transactions executed in connection with hedging activities, in the event that any lenders or counterparties, including insurance providers, are unable to honor their commitments or otherwise default under an agreement with Telesat or us.\nThe loss of executive officers and our inability to retain other key personnel could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to pursue strategic alternatives.\nLoral and Telesat rely on a number of key employees, including members of management and certain other employees possessing unique experience in technical and commercial aspects of the satellite services business. If Loral or Telesat are unable to retain these employees, it could be difficult to replace them. In addition, the business of Telesat, with its constant technological developments, must continue to attract highly qualified and technically skilled employees. In the future, the inability to retain or replace these key employees, or the inability to attract new highly qualified employees, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, business prospects and financial condition of Loral or Telesat.\nAlso, we have retained Michael B. Targoff, our former chief executive officer and president, as a consultant, in particular to provide assistance and guidance in the oversight of strategic matters relating to Telesat and XTAR. The consulting agreement may be terminated by either the Company or Mr. Targoff at any time for any reason or for no reason on ten days prior notice. There can be no assurance that Mr. Targoff will not terminate the agreement, and, were he to do so, the ability of the Company to close and implement the Transaction, or maintain its presence on the XTAR board of managers, could be adversely affected.\nMHR may be viewed as our controlling stockholder and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, various funds affiliated with MHR and Dr. Rachesky held approximately 39.9% of the outstanding voting common stock of Loral as well as all issued and outstanding shares of Loral non-voting common stock, which, when taken together, represent approximately 58.4% of the outstanding common equity of Loral as of December 31, 2020. As of March 5, 2021, representatives of MHR occupy two of the seven seats on our Board of Directors. One seat on our board, previously occupied by a former managing principal of MHR, is currently vacant. In addition, one of our other directors was selected by the creditors\u2019 committee in our predecessor\u2019s chapter 11 cases, in which MHR served as the chairman. Conflicts of interests may arise in the future between us and MHR. For example, MHR and its affiliated funds are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Under our agreement with PSP, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that either (i) ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by Dr. Rachesky, of our voting stock falls below certain levels other than in certain specific circumstances or (ii) there is a change in the composition of a majority of the members of the Loral Board of Directors over a consecutive two-year period without the approval of the incumbent directors, we will lose our veto rights relating to certain actions by Telesat. In addition, after either of these events, PSP will have certain rights to enable it to exit from its investment in Telesat, including a right to cause Telesat to conduct an initial public offering in which PSP\u2019s shares would be the first shares offered or, if no such offering has occurred within one year due to a lack of cooperation from Loral or Telesat, to cause the sale of Telesat and to drag along the other shareholders in such sale, subject to our right to call PSP\u2019s shares at fair market value.\nThere is a thin trading market for our voting common stock.\nTrading activity in our voting common stock, which is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, has generally been light, averaging approximately 181,000 shares per day for the year ended December 31, 2020. Moreover, over 50% of our voting common stock is effectively held by MHR and several other stockholders. If any of our significant stockholders should sell some or all of their holdings, it will likely have an adverse effect on our share price. Although the funds affiliated with MHR have restrictions on their ability to sell our shares under U.S. securities laws, we have filed a shelf registration statement in respect of the voting common stock and non-voting common stock they hold in Loral that effectively eliminates such restrictions. Such funds also have other demand and piggyback registration rights in respect of their Loral voting common stock and non-voting common stock that would also, if exercised, effectively eliminate such restrictions.\nThe market for our voting common stock could be adversely affected by future issuance of significant amounts of our voting common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 21,427,078 shares of our voting common stock and 9,505,673 shares of our non-voting common stock were outstanding. On that date, there were also outstanding 98,917 vested restricted stock units. These restricted stock units may be settled either in cash or Loral voting common stock at the Company\u2019s option.\nSales of significant amounts of our voting common stock to the public, or the perception that those sales could happen, could adversely affect the market for, and the trading price of, our voting common stock.\nChanges in tax rates or policies or changes to our tax liabilities could affect operating results.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxation on our worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the United States. Telesat is subject to income taxes in Canada and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate tax liabilities, and future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the applicable tax laws, composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates, valuation and utilization of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world. Many countries have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting final proposals from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and specific country anti-avoidance initiatives. Such tax law changes increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our results of operations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, and there can be no assurance that any final determination by a taxing authority will not result in additional tax liability which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe future use of tax attributes is limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had various tax attributes including carryforwards for federal net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of $43.1 million and foreign tax credits (\u201cFTCs\u201d) of $109.6 million and state NOLs that are available to offset future tax liability (see Notes 2 and 7 to the Loral consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting treatment of such tax attributes). As our emergence from bankruptcy on November 21, 2005 constituted an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use these tax attributes existing at such effective date is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $32.6 million (tax effect of $6.8 million), subject to increase or decrease based on certain factors. If Loral experiences an additional \u201cownership change\u201d during any three-year period after November 21, 2005, future use of these tax attributes may become further limited. An ownership change may be triggered by sales or acquisitions of Loral equity interests in excess of 50% by shareholders owning five percent or more of our total equity value, i.e., the total market value of our equity interests, as determined on any applicable testing date. A strategic transaction with respect to our ownership interest in Telesat could result in such an ownership change. We would be adversely affected by an additional \u201cownership change\u201d if, at the time of such change, the total market value of our equity multiplied by the federal applicable long-term tax exempt rate, which at March 1, 2021 was 1.22%, was less than $32.6 million. As of March 1, 2021, the total market value of our equity ($1.5 billion) multiplied by the federal applicable long-term tax exempt rate was approximately $18.1 million.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we, our intermediaries or companies in which we have an interest, such as Telesat and XTAR, fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nDeclines in the stock market and reductions in interest rates will increase our pension plan\u2019s unfunded status resulting in increased pension liabilities on our balance sheet and may require us to increase our pension plan contributions or make such contributions earlier than anticipated, thereby having an adverse effect on our financial position.\nOur qualified pension plan is invested primarily in equity and fixed income investments. Steep declines in the equity markets will have the effect of reducing our pension plan assets, thereby increasing the plan\u2019s unfunded status, resulting in increased pension liabilities on our balance sheet. In addition, reductions in interest rates, whether in connection with the Federal Reserve attempting to stabilize the markets or otherwise, will have the effect of increasing our pension plan obligations. A significant reduction in pension plan assets and/or increase in pension plan obligations will increase pension liabilities on our balance sheet and may have the effect of requiring us to increase our contributions to our pension plan or make such contributions earlier than we anticipated thereby having an adverse effect on our financial position.\nThird parties have significant rights with respect to our affiliates.\nThird parties have significant rights with respect to, and we do not have control over management of, our affiliates. For example, while we own 62.6% of the participating shares of Telesat, we own only 32.6% of the voting power. Also, Hisdesat enjoys substantial approval rights in regard to XTAR, our X-band joint venture. The rights of these third parties and fiduciary duties under applicable law could result in others acting or failing to act in ways that are not in our best interest.\nThe Telesat information in this report other than the information included in the audited financial statements is based solely on information provided to us by Telesat.\nBecause we do not control Telesat, we do not have the same control and certification processes with respect to the information contained in this report on Telesat that we would have if we controlled Telesat. We are also not involved in managing Telesat\u2019s day-to-day operations. Accordingly, the Telesat information contained in this report other than the information included in the audited financial statements is based solely on information provided to us by Telesat and has not been separately verified by us.", "PERMNO": 91024, "SIC": 4841, "TIC": "LORL"}
