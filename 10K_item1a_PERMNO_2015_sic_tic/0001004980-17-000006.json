RISK FACTORS\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies described in MD&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nRisks Related to the Outcome of Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability that the Utility incurs in connection with the Butte fire.\nIn September 2015, a wildfire (known as the \u201cButte fire\u201d) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California. On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire. According to Cal Fire\u2019s report, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in two fatalities, destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commercial properties, and damaged 44 structures. Cal Fire\u2019s report concluded that the wildfire was caused when a Gray Pine tree contacted the Utility\u2019s electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility and/or its vegetation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc., to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure of the tree. In a press release also issued on April 28, 2016, Cal Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million from the Utility.\nOn May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California for Sacramento County. Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date. The California Judicial Council had previously authorized the coordination of all cases in Sacramento County. As of December 31, 2016, complaints have been filed against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador involving approximately 1,950 individual plaintiffs representing approximately 950 households and their insurance companies. These complaints are part of or are in the process of being added to the two master complaints. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on inverse condemnation and negligence theories of liability. The number of individual complaints and plaintiffs may increase in the future.\nIn connection with this matter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees without having been found negligent, through the theory of inverse condemnation. In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent. The Utility believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss of at least $750 million for all potential damages described above. The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Butte fire in an aggregate amount of approximately $900 million. Such insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient to cover the Utility\u2019s ultimate liability.\nThe process for estimating costs associated with claims relating to the Butte fire requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors. As more information becomes known, including additional discovery from the plaintiffs and results from the ongoing mediation and settlement process, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Butte fire may change. A change in management\u2019s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition and the results of operations during the period such change occurred.\nIf the Utility records losses in connection with claims relating to the Butte fire that materially exceed the amount the Utility accrued for these liabilities, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in the reporting periods during which additional charges are recorded, depending on whether the Utility is able to record or collect insurance recoveries in amounts sufficient to offset such additional accruals. (For more information, see \u201cEnforcement and Litigation Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A and in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s future financial results may be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC\u2019s investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requests for information. The Utility also could incur material costs and fines in connection with future investigations, citations, audits, or enforcement actions.\nThe Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with a potential settlement or litigated outcome of the CPUC\u2019s investigation of the Utility\u2019s compliance with the CPUC\u2019s rules regarding ex parte communications. While on October 14, 2016, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, ORA, the SED, TURN, and the Utility submitted a status report to the CPUC which proposed an update to the framework for resolving the proceeding and included a total of 164 communications in the scope of the proceeding, the Utility expects that the other parties may argue that the number of violations exceeds the 164 communications referenced in the status report either because a single communication may have violated more than one rule or because they believe some of the material provided during discovery constitutes impermissible ex parte communications. The Utility expects to contest many of these assertions. If the matter does not settle, the CPUC will determine which communications included within the scope of the proceeding were in violation of its rules. The CPUC will also determine whether to impose penalties or other remedies, as a result of a potential settlement or otherwise. The CPUC can impose fines up to $50,000 for each violation, and up to $50,000 per day if the CPUC determines that the violation was continuing. The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as how many days each violation continued; the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC is also required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged. The CPUC has historically exercised broad discretion in determining whether violations are continuing and the amount of penalties to be imposed. While it is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s liquidity and results of operations. (See the discussion under the heading \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in MD&A.)\nThe Utility also is a target of a number of investigations and government requests for information. In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel. In addition, in October 2016, the Utility received a grand jury subpoena and letter from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California advising that the Utility is a target of a federal investigation regarding possible criminal violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and conspiracy to violate the act. The Utility was also contacted by certain other federal agencies with requests for information. While the Utility believes that these requests for information are routine, their outcome is uncertain. The Utility also is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility.\nIf these investigations or requests for information result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties or suffer negative consequences described above in the immediately preceding risk factor. In addition, a negative outcome in any of these investigations or future enforcement actions may negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility\u2019s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility\u2019s violations.\nThe Utility may incur fines and penalties in connection with the Utility\u2019s efforts to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights of way and the Penalty Decision. The Penalty Decision requires the SED to review the Utility\u2019s gas transmission operations (including the Utility\u2019s compliance with the remedies ordered by the Penalty Decision) and to perform annual audits of the Utility\u2019s record-keeping practices for a minimum of ten years. The SED could impose fines on the Utility or require the Utility to incur unrecoverable costs, or both, based on the outcome of these future audits. In addition, although PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not currently face the possibility of fines or penalties in the first phase of the CPUC\u2019s pending investigation into the Utility\u2019s safety culture since it has been categorized as rate setting, it is uncertain how a next phase, if any, would be categorized. (See the discussion under the heading \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in MD&A.)\nThe Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s future financial results could be materially affected by the conviction of the Utility in the federal criminal proceeding and by the debarment proceeding.\nOn August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, found the Utility guilty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity management regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility. The court sentenced the Utility to a five-year corporate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years, a fine of $3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service. The Utility has decided not to appeal the convictions.\nThe probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utility is required to retain a third-party monitor. The goal of the monitorship will be to prevent the criminal conduct with respect to gas pipeline transmission safety that gave rise to the conviction. To that end, the goal of the monitor will be to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of the gas transmission pipeline system, performs appropriate integrity management assessments on its gas transmission pipelines, and maintains an effective ethics and compliance program and safety related incentive program.\nAfter an initial assessment is conducted and an initial report is prepared by the monitor, the monitor will prepare reports on a semi-annual basis setting forth the monitor\u2019s continued assessment and making recommendations consistent with the goals and scope of the monitorship. The Utility expects that the monitor will be retained before the end of the second quarter of 2017.\nAt December 31, 2016, PG&E Corporation and the Utility\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets included a $3 million accrual in connection with this matter. The Utility could incur material costs and additional penalties, not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to the monitor\u2019s compensation or costs resulting from recommendations of the monitor).\nAlso, in September 2015, the Utility was notified that the DOI had initiated an inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs citing the San Bruno explosion and indicating, as the basis for the inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping, poor identification and evaluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB\u2019s investigation. On December 21, 2016, the Utility and the DOI entered into an interim administrative agreement that reflects the DOI\u2019s determination that the Utility remains eligible to contract with federal government agencies while the DOI determines whether any further action is necessary to protect the federal government\u2019s business interests. The agreement will be effective until superseded by an amended agreement or determination. The agreement also provides that the DOI is still conducting a review to determine whether the Utility has an effective compliance and ethics program and that the DOI is required to use its best efforts to complete its review before the end of 2017. If the DOI determines that the Utility\u2019s program is not generally effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct, the Utility may be required to enter into an amended administrative agreement and implement remedial and other measures, such as a requirement that the Utility\u2019s natural gas operations and/or compliance and ethics programs be supervised by one or more independent third party monitor(s).\nThe Utility\u2019s conviction and the outcome of the debarment proceeding could harm the Utility\u2019s relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example by, enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty. They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility\u2019s business is conducted or organized. As discussed under the heading \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A, the SED continues evaluating PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s organizational culture and governance in the CPUC\u2019s pending investigation to examine the Utility\u2019s safety culture.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility\u2019s ability to manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner.\nAs a regulated entity, the Utility\u2019s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover reasonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility\u2019s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the Utility\u2019s reputation (especially as a result of the Utility\u2019s conviction in the federal criminal trial), the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility\u2019s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility\u2019s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services.\nThe Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. The Utility\u2019s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility\u2019s electricity and natural gas services.\nIn addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility\u2019s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as storms, fires, accidents, catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility\u2019s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility.\nThe Utility\u2019s ability to recover its costs also may be affected by the economy and its impact on the Utility\u2019s customers. For example, a sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy could reduce the Utility\u2019s sales to industrial and commercial customers or the level of uncollectible bills could increase. Although the Utility generally recovers its costs through rates, regardless of sales volume, rate pressures increase when the costs are borne by a smaller sales base.\nChanges in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility\u2019s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as \u201cpass-through\u201d costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as \u201cpass-through\u201d costs. To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results depend upon the Utility\u2019s continuing ability to recover \u201cpass-through\u201d costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility\u2019s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility\u2019s rates to reflect such events.\nThe Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility\u2019s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of \u201cleast cost dispatch\u201d and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.\nFurther, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility\u2019s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility\u2019s customers to other retail providers. In particular, the Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the higher targets established by California SB 350 that became effective on January 1, 2016. Despite the CPUC\u2019s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the costs are unreasonably above market.\nThe Utility\u2019s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers. For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in California\u2019s then-newly established wholesale electricity market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimately causing the Utility to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nFurther, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through municipalization of the Utility\u2019s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See \u201cCompetition in the Electricity Industry\u201d in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. In addition, the Utility\u2019s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all.\nIn addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering (\u201cNEM\u201d), which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers. In January 2016, the CPUC adopted new NEM rules and rates. The new rules and rates became effective for new NEM customers of the Utility in December 2016. New NEM customers will be required to pay an interconnection fee, will go on time of use rates, and will be required to pay some non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay. However, the resulting rules will still put upward rate pressure on remaining customers, and remove the cap on the number of NEM customers. Significantly higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers. The CPUC states that it intends to revisit these rules in 2019.\nA confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility\u2019s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility\u2019s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility\u2019s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility\u2019s level of capital investment would likely decline as well, in turn leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results.\nThe CPUC has begun to implement rate reform to allow residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities\u2019 actual costs of providing service and decrease cost-subsidization among customer classes. Many aspects of rate reform are not yet finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose a fixed charge on certain customers. If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility\u2019s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected.\nRisks Related to Liquidity and Capital Requirements\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results will be affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to seek funds in the capital and credit markets to enable the Utility to make capital investments, pay fines that may be imposed in the future, as well as costs related to rights-of-way and legal and regulatory costs. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to access the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend primarily on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s credit ratings and outlook. Their credit ratings and outlook can be affected by many factors, including the pending CPUC investigations and ratemaking proceedings. If PG&E Corporation\u2019s or the Utility\u2019s credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing options, including reduced, or lack of, access to the commercial paper market, additional collateral posting requirements, which in turn could affect liquidity and lead to an increased financing need. Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies generally or PG&E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry, volatility in electricity or natural gas prices, an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, and general economic and financial market conditions.\nThe reputations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to suffer from the negative publicity about matters discussed under \u201cEnforcement and Litigation Matters\u201d in Item 7. MD&A. The negative publicity and the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters may undermine confidence in management\u2019s ability to execute its business strategy and restore a constructive regulatory environment, which could adversely impact PG&E Corporation\u2019s stock price. Further, the market price of PG&E Corporation common stock could decline materially depending on the outcome of these matters. The amount and timing of future share issuances also could affect the stock price.\nIf the Utility were unable to access the capital markets, it could be required to decrease or suspend dividends to PG&E Corporation and PG&E Corporation could be required to contribute capital to the Utility to enable the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve. To maintain PG&E Corporation\u2019s dividend level in these circumstances, PG&E Corporation would be further required to access the capital or credit markets. PG&E Corporation may need to decrease or discontinue its common stock dividend if it is unable to access the capital or credit markets on reasonable terms.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s ability to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the Utility\u2019s earnings and cash flows.\nPG&E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own. The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation. Under the CPUC\u2019s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility\u2019s dividend policy must be established by the Utility's Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and PG&E Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors give \u201cfirst priority\u201d to the Utility\u2019s capital requirements, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility\u2019s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. The CPUC has interpreted this \u201cfirst priority\u201d obligation to include the requirement that PG&E Corporation \u201cinfuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.\u201d In addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&E Corporation, the Utility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equity component.\nIf the Utility were required to pay a material amount of fines or incur material unrecoverable costs in connection with the terms of the probation or monitorship, the pending CPUC investigations, or other enforcement matters, it would require incremental equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to restore its capital structure. PG&E Corporation common stock issuances used to fund such equity contributions could materially dilute EPS. (See \u201cLiquidity and Financial Resources\u201d in Item 7. MD&A.) Further, if PG&E Corporation were required to infuse the Utility with significant capital or if the Utility was unable to distribute cash to PG&E Corporation, or both, PG&E Corporation may be unable to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend, or meet other obligations.\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s ability to pay dividends also could be affected by financial covenants contained in their respective credit agreements that require each company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated capitalization of at most 65%.\nRisks Related to Operations and Information Technology\nThe Utility\u2019s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can adversely affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results. The Utility\u2019s insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic event, or may not become available at a reasonable cost, or available at all.\nThe Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system. (See \u201cElectric Utility Operations\u201d and \u201cNatural Gas Utility Operations\u201d in Item 1. Business.) The Utility\u2019s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives. The Utility\u2019s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility\u2019s control, including those that arise from:\n\u25cf\nthe breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions, fires, or other catastrophic events;\n\u25cf\nan overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operating procedures, or welding or fabrication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets and uncontained natural gas flow;\n\u25cf\nfailure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life;\n\u25cf\na prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility\u2019s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environmental damage, or reputational damage;\n\u25cf\nthe release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility\u2019s assets are built;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion), and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event;\n\u25cf\ninadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or extended outages;\n\u25cf\nsevere weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, wild land and other fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters;\n\u25cf\noperator or other human error;\n\u25cf\nan ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;\n\u25cf\nconstruction performed by third parties that damage the Utility\u2019s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or \u201cdig-ins\u201d that damage the Utility\u2019s underground pipelines;\n\u25cf\nthe release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the Utility\u2019s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and\n\u25cf\nattacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility\u2019s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties.\nIn particular, the Utility may incur material liability in connection with the Butte fire. (See \u201cPG&E Corporation and the Utility may incur material liability in connection with Butte Fire\u201d above.) Additionally, on January 12, 2017, a residential structure fire occurred in Yuba City, California resulting in the collapse of the house and injuries to two persons inside the house. The CPUC, a third-party engineering firm, and local fire and police officials are investigating the origin and cause of the incident. The Utility may incur material costs, including as a result of these investigations or any proceedings that could be commenced in connection with this incident.\nFurther, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor\u2019s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions.\nInsurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results. Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility\u2019s current insurance coverage or may not be available at all.\nFurther, California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California for wildfire damages. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys\u2019 fees) for damages and takings as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including its electric transmission lines. As a result of the strict liability standard applied to wildfires, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increase of wildfires including as a result of the ongoing drought, and the Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at comparable cost and terms as the Utility\u2019s current insurance coverage, or at all. In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.\nIf the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected.\nThe Utility\u2019s operational and information technology systems could fail to function properly or be improperly accessed or damaged by third parties (including cyber-attacks and physical acts) or damaged by severe weather, natural disasters, or other events. Any of these events could disrupt the Utility\u2019s operations and cause the Utility to incur unanticipated losses and expense or liability to third parties.\nThe operation of the Utility\u2019s extensive electricity and natural gas systems relies on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties. All of the Utility\u2019s operational and technology systems and network infrastructure are vulnerable to disability or failures in the event of cyber-attacks and physical acts. Cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and may include computer hacking, viruses, malware, social engineering, denial of service attacks, ransomware, destructive malware, or other means of disruption, destruction, or unauthorized access, acquisition or control. In addition, hardware, software, or applications the Utility develops or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Physical attacks may include acts of sabotage, acts of war, acts of terrorism, or other physical acts. The Utility\u2019s operational and information technology systems and networks are deemed critical infrastructure, and any failure or decrease in their functionality could, among other things, cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility\u2019s ability to generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas, or otherwise operate in the most efficient manner or at all, undermine the Utility\u2019s performance of critical business functions, damage the Utility\u2019s assets or operations or those of third parties, and lead to reputational harm. As a result, such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in fines and penalties, and loss of customers, any of which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Utility\u2019s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require ongoing maintenance, modification, and updating, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction. The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility\u2019s systems and information, or experience internal or external security incidents. Any incidents, disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification of existing systems or implementation of new systems could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, or diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention and resources, or negatively affect the Utility\u2019s ability to maintain effective financial controls or timely file required regulatory reports. The Utility also could be subject to patent infringement claims arising from the use of third-party technology by the Utility or by a third-party vendor.\nIn addition, the Utility\u2019s information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees. A data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utility to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. It could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the Utility\u2019s reputation.\nThe Utility and its third party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility\u2019s information technology systems, or confidential data, or to disrupt the Utility\u2019s operations. None of these attempts or breaches has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent the unauthorized access to its systems, infrastructure, or data, or the disruption of its operations, either of which could materially affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile the Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.\nThe operation and decommissioning of the Utility\u2019s nuclear power plants expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire.\nThe operation of the Utility\u2019s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility\u2019s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)\nOn August 11, 2016, the Utility submitted an application to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 and replace it with a portfolio of energy efficiency and GHG-free resources. The application includes a joint proposal between the Utility and certain interested parties, entered into on June 20, 2016. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility\u2019s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility\u2019s financial results.\nIn addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the company. The Utility currently estimates that the additional cost of the employee retention program and the employee retraining and development program will be approximately $350 million. The Joint Proposal seeks confirmation from the CPUC that these costs will be recovered through the Utility\u2019s nuclear decommissioning electric rates. The employee retention and retraining and development programs are subject to bargaining with the Utility\u2019s labor unions. The Utility will also incur costs in connection with an employee severance program. The severance program was previously approved by the CPUC in prior nuclear decommissioning ratemaking proceedings.\nThe Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. (See \u201cRegulatory Environment\u201d in Item 1. Business.) If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2016, the Utility\u2019s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion.\nAt the state level, the California Water Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%. If the California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge. If the Utility obtains contingent approvals referred to herein that will result in retiring Diablo Canyon at the end of the current NRC operating licenses, the Utility will not be required to install cooling towers or implement alternative measures in order to comply with the California State Water Board Once-Through Cooling Water Policy, thus eliminating the regulatory uncertainty regarding the measures that could have been imposed on the Utility or of incurring a material charge related thereto. Even if the Utility is ultimately not required to install cooling towers, under the State Water Board\u2019s interim mitigation measures applicable to Diablo Canyon\u2019s operations prior to 2025, starting in 2016, it will be required to make payments to the California Coastal Conservancy to fund various environmental mitigation projects, that the Utility does not expect to exceed $5 million per year.\nOn June 28, 2016 the California State Lands Commission approved an extension of the Utility\u2019s leases of coastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge structures for the nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon, to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon\u2019s current operating licenses. The Utility will be required to obtain an additional lease extension from the State Lands Commission to cover the period of time necessary to decommission the facility. The State Lands Commission and California Coastal Commission will evaluate appropriate environmental mitigation and development conditions associated with the decommissioning project, the costs of which could be substantial.\nThe Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. If the Utility\u2019s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected.\nRisks Related to Environmental Factors\nThe Utility\u2019s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results.\nThe Utility\u2019s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)\nEnvironmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions.\nThe CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates.\nSome of the Utility\u2019s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. (See \u201cEnvironmental Regulation\u201d in Item 1.) The Utility\u2019s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.\nThe Utility\u2019s future operations may be affected by climate change that may have a material impact on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the Utility\u2019s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather. While snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains has been at higher than normal levels this winter, California has experienced ongoing drought in the past. If temperatures and the levels of precipitation in the Utility\u2019s service territory continue to change, that could impact the levels of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. As a result, the Utility\u2019s hydroelectric generation could change and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation.\nIf the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, increasing temperatures and lower levels of precipitation could increase the occurrence of wildfires in the Utility\u2019s service territory causing damage to the Utility\u2019s facilities or the facilities of third parties on which the Utility relies to provide service, damage to third parties for loss of property, personal injury, or loss of life. In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility\u2019s facilities, including hydroelectric assets such as dams and canals, and the electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase.\nEvents or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility\u2019s operations than the Utility\u2019s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility\u2019s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nOther Risk Factors\nPG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected as a result of political and legislative developments.\nThe Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected as a result of the recent change in federal administration from President Barack Obama to President Donald Trump. For example, the new administration has indicated tax reform as a priority. Tax reform outlines produced by both President Trump and the Tax Reform Task Force include proposals related to federal tax rates, deductions for state income taxes (and potentially property tax), interest expense deduction, capital expenditure deduction, and expensing plant. It is unclear what tax reform may be ultimately adopted. It is generally expected that a tax reform bill will be introduced in early 2017.\nThe Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility\u2019s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal.\nThe Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility\u2019s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility\u2019s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility. If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility\u2019s compliance costs. In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility\u2019s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility. In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain.\nThe Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected.\nPoor investment performance or other factors could require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial results could be materially affected.\nThe Utility\u2019s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur.\nThe Utility\u2019s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility\u2019s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings. Any such occurrences could negatively impact PG&E Corporation\u2019s and the Utility\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 13688, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "PCG"}
