The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry and customer needs or trends may affect our competitiveness or demand for our products, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Our businesses operate in industries that are subject to technological advancements, new competitors, developing industry standards, and changing customer needs and preferences. Also, our customers continue to adopt new technology for business and personal uses. We must anticipate and respond to these industry and customer changes in order to remain competitive within our relative markets. For example, our ability to provide innovative point-of-sale technology to our merchant customers could have an impact on our International and Merchant Solutions business. Furthermore, customers' potential negative reaction to our products and services can spread quickly through social media and damage our reputation before we have the opportunity to respond.\nSecurity breaches or attacks of our systems may have a significant effect on our business.\nIn order to provide our services, we process and store sensitive business information and personal consumer information in order to provide our services. The confidentiality of the customer/consumer information that resides on our systems is critical to the successful operations of our business. We have what we deem to be sufficient security around the system to prevent unauthorized access to the system. However, our position in the global payments industry may attract hackers to conduct attacks on our systems that could compromise the security of our data. In addition, the increasing sophistication level of cyber criminals may increase the risk of a security breach of our systems. A breach of our products or systems processing or storing sensitive business information or personal consumer information could lead to claims against us, reputational damage, loss of customers\u2019 confidence, as well as imposition of fines and damages, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, and future growth. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve we may be required to invest additional resources to modify the security of our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe depend, in part, on our merchant relationships and alliances to grow our Merchant Solutions business. If we are unable to maintain these relationships and alliances, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur alliance structures take on different forms, including consolidated subsidiaries, equity method investments, and revenue sharing arrangements. Under the alliance program, a bank or other institution form an alliance with us, either contractually or through a separate legal entity. Merchant contracts may be contributed to the alliance by us and/or the bank or institution. The banks and other institutions generally provide card association sponsorship, clearing, and settlement services. These institutions typically act as a merchant referral source when the institution has an existing banking or other relationship. We provide transaction processing and related functions. Both alliance partners may provide management, sales, marketing, and other administrative services. The alliance structure allows us to be the processor for multiple financial institutions, any one of which may be selected by the merchant as their bank partner. We rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships, alliances, and other distribution channels. There can be no guarantee that this growth will continue. The loss of merchant relationships or alliance and financial institution partners could negatively impact our business and result in a reduction of our revenue and profit.\nThe market for our electronic commerce services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough for us to maintain and increase our profitability.\nIf the number of electronic commerce transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services, it could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We believe future growth in the electronic commerce market will be driven by the cost, ease-of-use, and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses. In order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability, consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services, including our merchant suite, Clover, Perka, and Gyft solutions.\nThe ability to recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel is critical to our success and growth.\nAll of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological, social, economic, and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. For us to successfully compete and grow, we must retain, recruit, and develop the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of our intellectual capital needs. In addition, we must develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. However, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our effort to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. We cannot assure that key personnel, including executive officers, will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nGlobal economics, political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending, which may adversely impact our revenue and profitability.\nThe global electronic payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business, and government spending. A sustained deterioration in the general economic conditions, particularly in the United States or Europe, or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards. A reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease of our revenue and profits.\nA weakening in the economy could also force some retailers to close, resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and transaction declines and us earning less on transactions due also to a potential shift to large discount merchants. Additionally, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and be more selective with regard to which they issue credit cards. Changes in economic conditions could adversely impact our future revenues and profits and result in a downgrade of our debt ratings which may lead to termination or modification of certain contracts and make it more difficult for us to obtain new business.\nWe are subject to the credit risk that our merchants will be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our merchants being unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable. For example, our merchant acquiring alliances along with us are contingently liable for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants. If we or the alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, due to the merchant\u2019s insolvency or other reasons, we or the alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. We have an active program to manage our credit risk and often mitigate our risk by obtaining collateral. However, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. Examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit, debit or prepaid card, card number or other credentials to record a false sales transaction, processes an invalid card, or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud. It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud would increase our chargeback liability or other liability. Increases in chargebacks or other liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may experience breakdowns in our processing systems that could damage customer relations and expose us to liability.\nOur core business depends heavily on the reliability of our processing systems. A system outage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Not only would we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage, but we may also be liable to third parties. Many of our contractual agreements with financial institutions require us to pay penalties if our systems do not meet certain operating standards. To successfully operate our business, we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption, including from events that may be beyond our control. Events that could cause system interruptions include, but are not limited to, fire, natural disaster,\nunauthorized entry, power loss, telecommunications failure, computer viruses, terrorist acts, and war. Although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures, there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures. We perform the vast majority of disaster recovery operations ourselves, though we utilize select third parties for some aspects of recovery, particularly internationally. To the extent we outsource our disaster recovery, we are at risk of the vendor\u2019s unresponsiveness in the event of breakdowns in our systems. In addition, our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur.\nWe may experience software defects, computer viruses and development delays, which could damage customer relations, our potential profitability and expose us to liability.\nOur products are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays, and the underlying software may contain undetected errors, viruses or defects. Defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential customers, harm to our reputation, or exposure to liability claims. In addition, we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation-of-liability provisions in our license and customer agreements, we cannot assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability.\nFuture consolidation of client financial institutions or other client groups may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have experienced the negative impact of the substantial bank industry consolidation in recent years. Bank industry consolidation impacts existing and potential clients in our service areas, primarily in Financial Services and Merchant Solutions. Our alliance strategy could be negatively impacted as a result of consolidations, especially where the banks involved are committed to their internal merchant processing businesses that compete with us. Bank consolidation has led to an increasingly concentrated client base, resulting in a changing client mix for Financial Services as well as increased price compression. Further consolidation in the bank industry or other client base could have a negative impact on us, including a loss of revenue and price compression.\nAcquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results.\nWe have been an active business acquirer and may continue to be active in the future. The acquisition and integration of businesses involves a number of risks. The core risks are in the areas of valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business) and integration (managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company\u2019s people, products, technology, and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition).\nIn addition, international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for example:\n\u2022\nmanaging geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;\n\u2022\ncomplying with foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nenforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulty entering new foreign markets due to, among other things, customer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nWe rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. If we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. If such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services we must find other financial institutions to provide those services. If we are unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers, which could negatively impact our revenue and earnings.\nChanges in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations.\nFrom time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the organization and/or processing fees (known as interchange fees) that they charge. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. Any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes.\nOur business may be adversely affected by risks associated with foreign operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to the changes in currency rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenue and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, we utilize foreign currency forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with foreign currency-denominated transactions. However, these hedge contracts may not eliminate all of the risks related to foreign currency translation. In addition, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into U.S. dollars. The occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues and earnings we derive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2014, we had $20.9 billion of total debt. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to obtain network sponsorship and clearing services from financial institutions or to obtain or retain other business with financial institutions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nOur senior secured revolving credit facility has $1.0 billion in commitments that mature in September 2016. We may not be able to refinance our senior secured credit facilities or our other existing indebtedness because of our high levels of debt, debt incurrence restrictions under our debt agreements or because of adverse conditions in credit markets generally.\nIncrease in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities to the extent the interest rate is not fixed by an interest rate swap, are at variable rates of interest. An increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $8.6 billion aggregate principal amount of variable rate long-term indebtedness, of which interest rate swaps fix the interest rate on $5.0 billion in notional amount. We also had a $750 million fixed to floating swap to preserve the ratio of fixed and floating rate debt that we had prior to the April 2011 debt modification and amendment. As a result, as of December 31, 2014, the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $44 million. See the discussion of our interest rate swap transactions in Note 5 \"Derivative Financial Instruments\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 60% of our total assets at December 31, 2014. These assets consist primarily of goodwill and customer relationship intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. We also expect to engage in additional acquisitions, which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets. Under current accounting standards, we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset, while goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized. On a regular basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and certain intangible assets. If the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense.\nOur tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local, and international taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions, and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. These reserves reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority. While we believe that the reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there is no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost not in excess of any related reserve. An unfavorable resolution, therefore, could negatively impact our effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in the current and/or future periods. Refer to Note 15 \"Income Taxes\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nAs a voluntary filer, the information provided in our periodic reports is subject to limited regulatory oversight which may adversely impact our ability to provide accurate and complete financial reports. In addition, we could discontinue filing with the SEC at any time.\nWe are currently a voluntary filer and not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. While we are required to provide certain information, including financial information, about our company to holders of our indebtedness pursuant to the agreements governing such indebtedness and our parent company is required to provide certain information to its shareholders, we may discontinue filing periodic reports with the SEC at any time. As a voluntary filer, our periodic reports will be subject to less oversight and regulatory scrutiny than those subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. In addition, even if we file a registration statement that is declared effective during the year and we become subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC, any of our periodic reporting responsibilities will automatically terminate in the event that we have less than 300 shareholders after the year in which any registration statement that we file with the SEC becomes effective.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nFailure to comply with or changes in laws, regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect the products, services and markets in which we operate.\nWe, and our customers, are subject to laws and regulations that affect the electronic payments industry in the many countries in which our services are used. In particular, our customers are subject to numerous laws and regulations applicable to banks, financial institutions and card issuers in the United States and abroad, and, consequently, we are at times affected by these\nfederal, state, and local laws and regulations. The U.S. Congress and governmental agencies have increased their scrutiny of a number of credit card practices, from which some of our customers derive significant revenue. Regulation of the payments industry, including regulations applicable to us and our customers, has increased significantly in recent years. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and/or the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. We are subject to U.S. and international financial services regulations, a myriad of consumer protection laws, economic sanctions, laws and regulations, and anti-corruption laws, escheat regulations and privacy and information security regulations to name only a few. Changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement of them, could have a negative financial effect on us. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which was signed into law in July 2010, significantly changed the U.S. financial regulatory system, including creating a new independent agency funded by the Federal Reserve Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to regulate consumer financial products and services (including many offered by our customers), restricting debit card fees paid by merchants to issuer banks and allowing merchants to offer discounts for different payment methods.\nChanges in credit card association or other network rules or standards could adversely affect our business.\nIn order to provide our transaction processing services, several of our subsidiaries are registered with Visa and MasterCard and other networks as members or service providers for member institutions. As such, we and many of our customers are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our customers to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us, acquirer customers, processing customers, and merchants. Visa, MasterCard, and other networks, some of which are our competitors, set the standards with respect to which we must comply. The termination of our member registration or our status as a certified service provider, or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to or through our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights and defend ourselves from potential patent infringement claims may diminish our competitive advantages or restrict it from delivering our services.\nOur trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property are important to our future success. The FIRST DATA trademark and trade name and the STAR trademark and trade name are intellectual property rights which are individually material to us. These trademarks and trade names are widely recognized and associated with quality and reliable service. Loss of the proprietary use of the FIRST DATA or STAR trademarks and trade names or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with them could harm the growth of our businesses. We also rely on proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology. Assurance of protecting our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information cannot be guaranteed. Our patents could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others, and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or advantage. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could lose competitive advantages and be materially adversely affected. The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings could prevent us from selling our services or prevent us from preventing others from selling competing services, and thereby may have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations. Additionally, claims have been made, are currently pending, and other claims may be made in the future, with regard to our technology allegedly infringing on a patent or other intellectual property rights. Unfavorable resolution of these claims could either result in us being restricted from delivering the related product or service or result in a settlement that could be materially adverse to us.\nFailure to comply with state and federal antitrust requirements could adversely affect our business.\nThrough our merchant alliances, we hold an ownership interest in several competing merchant acquiring businesses while serving as an electronic processor for those businesses. In order to satisfy state and federal antitrust requirements, we actively maintain an antitrust compliance program. Notwithstanding our compliance program, it is possible that perceived or actual violation of state or federal antitrust requirements could give rise to regulatory enforcement investigations or actions. Regulatory scrutiny of, or regulatory enforcement action in connection with, compliance with state and federal antitrust requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe are the subject of various legal proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nWe are involved in various litigation matters. We are also involved in or are the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations and makes voluntary self-disclosures to government or regulatory agencies from time to time. If we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters, or any other legal proceeding, we may be forced to pay damages or fines, enter into consent decrees and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.", "PERMNO": 77546, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "FDC"}
