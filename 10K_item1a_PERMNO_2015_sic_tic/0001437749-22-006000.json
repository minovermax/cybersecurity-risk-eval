{"cik": "1132651", "company": "AMES NATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below is a description of risk factors related to the Company\u2019s business, provided to enable investors to assess, and be appropriately apprised of, certain risks and uncertainties the Company faces in conducting its business. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere in this Report, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are also applicable to forward-looking statements contained in this Report and in other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nEconomic and Market Condition Risks\nChanges in general business, economic and political conditions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nOur earnings and financial condition are affected by general business, economic and political conditions. For example, a depressed economic environment increases the likelihood of lower employment levels and recession, which could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. General business and economic conditions that could affect us include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and the strength of the national and local economies in which we operate. Political conditions can also affect our earnings through the introduction of new regulatory policies, changes in tax laws and changes in trade policies.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of customers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment not only in the markets where we operate but also in the state of Iowa generally and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors: economic growth; efficient capital markets; low inflation; low unemployment; high business and investor confidence; and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nEconomic conditions in our market, the state of Iowa, and the United States have been highly volatile primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic wanes economic conditions may improve, but there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue or occur at a meaningful rate. Stagnant or declining economic conditions, whether due to continuing adverse effects of the pandemic or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nHigher inflation may affect the Company\u2019s interest rates, provision for loan losses and general operating expenses.\nConsumer inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (\u201cCPI\u201d) has increased from 1.4% as of December 31, 2020 to 7.0% as of December 31, 2021. This increase in inflation creates upward pressure on the cost of hiring, training, and retaining employees, other general operating expense and interest rates. The challenge for the Company will be keeping wages competitive and maintaining general operating expenses at their current levels, while balancing a potential decrease in net interest income due to the Company\u2019s greater sensitivity to the repricing of its interest-bearing liabilities than its interest-earning assets in the short-term. The Company\u2019s provision for loan losses may be impacted by the borrower\u2019s ability to service their debt if inflation is prolonged.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the national, Iowa and local economies in which the Company conducts business, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, increased unemployment levels and created hardships for our customers. The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability.\nAlthough the Company continued operating during the initial shutdowns, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and could continue to cause disruptions in the future. Impacts to our business have included costs due to remote access for our employees and additional health and safety precautions implemented at our offices; increases in customers' inability to make scheduled loan payments; increases in requests for loan modifications; and an adverse effect on accounting estimates that we use to determine our provision and allowance for credit losses. A worsening or prolonged continuation of unfavorable economic conditions could further impact our provision and allowance for credit losses, and could impact the value of certain assets that we carry on our balance sheet such as goodwill.\nWhile we have taken and are continuing to take precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or appropriate. The continued or renewed spread of COVID-19, including the new Omicron variant of the virus recently discovered, could negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business, the business and operations of our third-party service providers who perform critical services for our business, or the businesses of many of our customers.\nAmong the factors outside our control that are likely to affect the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have on our business are:\n\u25cf\nthe pandemic's course, duration and severity;\n\u25cf\nthe direct and indirect results of the pandemic, such as the disruption of supply chains, the emergence of significant inflationary pressures in the economy and recessionary economic trends, including with respect to employment, wages and benefits, commercial activity, consumer spending and real estate market values;\n\u25cf\nthe continuing impact of the pandemic on the ability of our loan customers to perform their loan obligations;\n\u25cf\ndeclines in collateral values;\n\u25cf\npolitical, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic, including the effects of restrictions on commerce and banking, such as moratoria and other suspensions of collections, foreclosures, and related obligations;\n\u25cf\nthe timing, magnitude and effect of public spending, directly or through subsidies, its direct and indirect effects on commercial activity and incentives of employers and individuals to resume or increase employment, wages and benefits and commercial activity;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and availability of direct and indirect governmental support for various financial assets;\n\u25cf\npotential longer-term effects of increased government spending on the interest rate environment and borrowing costs for non-governmental parties;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our employees and our third-party vendors to work effectively during the course of the pandemic; and\n\u25cf\nany increase in cyber and payment fraud related to COVID-19, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from disruption, given increased online banking, e-commerce and other online activity.\nWe are monitoring the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks, although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. However, if the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise result in a continuation or worsening of the current economic environment, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCredit Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk.\nThe operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. In order to successfully manage credit risk, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards, implement and observe appropriate procedures for monitoring our outstanding loans and ensure that our bankers follow those standards and procedures. The weakening of these standards or procedures for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, our inability to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers may negatively impact the quality of our loan portfolio, result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, therefore reducing our earnings. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk, particularly during the period of economic disruption caused by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe commercial real estate loan portfolio is a significant part of the Company\u2019s business and subject to the risk of fluctuating collateral values.\nCommercial real estate loans were a significant portion of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021. The market value of real estate securing these loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nIf the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that was anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could cause an increase in charge-offs, resulting in the need to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affecting our operating results and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the national, Iowa and local economies and, in turn, on the Company\u2019s borrowers. In particular, the Company\u2019s management believes that the credit risk associated with the hospitality and fitness loans included in the Company\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio has been heightened as a result of the pandemic. This sector has been affected more than other areas of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio and, consequently, the credit management team has remained in regular contact with these borrowers in an effort to better manage potential credit losses.\nIf the Company\u2019s actual loan losses exceed the allowance for loan losses or increase significantly, the Company\u2019s net income will decrease.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level believed to be adequate to absorb estimated losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; credit loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.\nDetermination of the allowance is inherently subjective, and has become more challenging with the uncertainty of the effects and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it requires significant estimates and management\u2019s judgment of credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses to be funded through provision expense. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. Also, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses or increase significantly; we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increase in provision expense will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLoans to agricultural-related borrowers are subject to factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including fluctuations in commodity and livestock prices, government trade policies and other risks, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s loan portfolio.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans to borrowers who are directly or indirectly affected by the health of the Iowa agricultural economy. An extended period of low commodity and/or livestock prices, together with other risks to which our agricultural borrowers are subject, including poor weather conditions, higher input costs, changes in governmental support programs and uncertainty regarding governmental mandates affecting ethanol production, could result in reduced cash flows and profit margins, negatively affecting these borrowers and making it more difficult for them to repay their loan obligations to us. Moreover, uncertainty as to the status of tariffs on products that our agricultural borrowers export to foreign markets could result in further volatility and deterioration of the price of agricultural products, providing further challenges and risk to our portfolio of agricultural loans. A general decline in the agricultural economy could also negatively affect us by reducing the value of agricultural real estate which secures some of our agricultural loans, creating the potential for greater losses if these borrowers are unable to repay their loans and we are forced to rely on this collateral. Moreover, a general decline in the agricultural economy could also negatively impact some of our commercial borrowers whose businesses are directly or indirectly dependent on the health of the agricultural economy. All of these risks, which are beyond our control, could produce losses in our loan portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit risk related to defaulted PPP loans that are determined to be non-compliant.\nThere is credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, or if the borrowers fraudulently obtained a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nLiquidity and Interest Rate Risks\nFair values of investments in the Company\u2019s securities portfolio may adversely change.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $831.0 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of those securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, an unfavorable change in the liquidity of an investment, rating agency downgrades of the securities, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause us to recognize an other-than- temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods and result in realized losses that negatively impact earnings. The success of any investment activity is affected by general economic conditions. Unexpected volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which we hold securities could reduce our liquidity and stockholders' equity. To mitigate these risks, we have access to lines of credit that provide additional liquidity, if needed.\nOur investment securities are analyzed quarterly to determine whether, in the opinion of management, any of the securities have OTTI. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities is determined to have OTTI and is credit loss related, we will recognize a charge to our earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made, and our earnings and capital ratios will be adversely impacted. Generally, a fixed income security is determined to have OTTI when it appears unlikely that we will receive all of the principal and interest due in accordance with the original terms of the investment. In addition to credit losses, losses are recognized for a security having an unrealized loss if we have the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before collection of the principal amount.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nShort-term federal funds interest rates remained stable in 2021 after falling 1.50% in 2020. Intermediate and longer-term rates increased in 2021 after decreasing in 2020. With interest rates now at historically low levels, but expected to increase during 2022 in response to inflationary pressure in the economy, the Company\u2019s challenge will be managing its interest expense which will increase more quickly than interest income, as the interest-bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets, placing downward pressure on the net interest margin. A reduction in the net interest margin could negatively affect our results of operations, including earnings. In response to this challenge, we model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates. Management believes our earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and interest rate risk positions.\nThe inability to deploy excess liquidity may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is essential to the banking business. Excess liquidity or the inability to maintain liquidity through deposits, borrowing, sale of securities or other sources could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity.\nWe maintain liquidity primarily through customer deposits and through access to other short-term funding sources, including advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) overnight borrowings, purchased federal funds and a line of credit. If governmental programs or economic conditions change so that we continue to have excess liquidity due to increases in deposit balances, we might experience excess liquidity issues. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated increase or reductions in our liquidity. In such events, our cost of funds may decrease, but our investments options may become limited, thereby reducing our net interest income. This situation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on dividends and other payments from its Banks for substantially all of its revenue.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our Banks, and we receive substantially all of our operating cash flows from dividends and other payments from our Banks. These dividends and payments are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amounts of dividends that our Banks may pay to us. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event our Banks are unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. The inability to receive dividends from our Banks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company may not be able to attract and retain key personnel and other skilled employees.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the skills of our management team and our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key officers and employees. Our senior management team has significant industry experience, and their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replace. None of our executive officers have employment agreements in keeping with the past practice of the Company and the Banks. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. Competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is considerable, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. We need to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business. In addition, as a provider of commercial and agricultural banking services, we must attract and retain qualified banking personnel to continue to grow our business, and competition for such personnel can be intense. Our ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive compensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by applicable banking laws and regulations. The loss of the services of any senior executive or other key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, to attract and retain personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, we may offer a variety of benefits, which could reduce our earnings or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures, errors, data security breaches and customer or employee fraud.\nThere have been a number of publicized cases involving errors, fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. Employee fraud, errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could also subject us to civil claims for negligence.\nAlthough we maintain a system of internal controls and procedures designed to reduce the risk of loss from employee or customer fraud or misconduct and employee errors as well as insurance coverage to mitigate against some operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud; these internal controls may fail to prevent or detect such an occurrence, or such an occurrence may not be insured or exceed applicable insurance limits.\nIn addition, there have also been a number of cases where financial institutions have been the victim of fraud related to unauthorized wire and automated clearinghouse transactions. The facts and circumstances of each case vary but generally involve criminals posing as customers (i.e., stealing bank customers\u2019 identities) to transfer funds out of the institution quickly in an effort to place the funds beyond recovery prior to detection. Although we have policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of our customers and prevent identity theft, we can provide no assurances that these policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. In addition, although we have safeguards in place, it is possible that our computer systems could be infiltrated by hackers or other intruders resulting in loss, destruction or misuse of our data or confidential information about our customers. We can provide no assurances that these safeguards will prevent all unauthorized infiltrations or breaches. Identity theft, successful unauthorized intrusions and similar unauthorized conduct could result in reputational damage and financial losses to the Company.\nAn impairment charge of goodwill or other intangibles could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the Company has grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets are included in the consolidated assets reflected in our financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets were $14.9 million as of December 31, 2021. Under generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually or sooner if events occur that indicate impairment could exist. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a sustained decline in a reporting unit\u2019s fair value, legal and regulatory factors, operating performance indicators, competition and other factors. GAAP requires us to assign and then test goodwill at the reporting unit level. If over a sustained period of time we experience a decrease in our stock price and market capitalization, which may serve as an estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit, this may be an indication of impairment. If the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its net book value, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future. In addition, if the revenue and cash flows generated from any of our other intangible assets is not sufficient to support its net book value, we may be required to record an impairment charge. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken.\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards, or changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how the Company reports its results of operations and financial condition.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our results of operation and financial condition. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our accounting policies could materially affect our financial statements. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the SEC, banking regulators and our outside auditors) may change positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially affect how we report our results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently and retroactively, which may result in the Company being required to restate prior period financial statements in material amounts. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring, and given the current economic and regulatory environment, more significant changes may occur. The implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring companies to estimate current expected credit losses. The standard, which is a major change for banking organizations, becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. The new standard is likely to result in more timely recognition of credit losses than under the incurred loss model currently used by the Company, and the Company is evaluating the extent to which the new guidance will affect results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies and methods require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure they comply with GAAP and reflect management's judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances. The application of that chosen accounting policy or method might result in us reporting different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. If management's estimates or assumptions are incorrect, we may experience a material loss.\nWe have identified three accounting policies as being \"critical\" to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These critical accounting policies relate to (1) the fair value and possible impairment losses on investment securities available for sale, (2) the allowance for loan losses, and (3) impairment of goodwill. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the estimates required to apply these policies, no assurance can be given that application of alternative policies or methods might not result in the reporting of different amounts of the fair value of securities available for sale, the allowance for loan losses, goodwill valuation and, accordingly, net income.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are concentrated in Iowa.\nOur operations are concentrated primarily in central, north-central and south-central Iowa. As a result of this geographic concentration, our results of operations may correlate to the economic conditions in this area. Any deterioration in economic conditions in central, north-central or south-central Iowa, particularly in the industries on which the area depends (including agriculture which, in turn, is dependent upon commodity prices, weather conditions, trade policies and government support programs), may adversely affect the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services, and accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to the Company\u2019s reputation could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends upon earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, investors, and employees. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business. Harm to our reputation could arise from numerous sources, including employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation, breach of information security or other cybersecurity events, or governmental investigations, among other things. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation, breach of information security, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which could lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Adverse publicity about us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our business. Should any events or circumstances that could undermine our reputation occur, there can be no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we may incur in addressing such issues would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in technology could be costly.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and there is a risk we could become less competitive if we are unable to take advantage of these improvements due to the cost limitations or otherwise.\nA breach of information security, compliance breach, or error by one of the Company\u2019s agents or vendors could negatively affect the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nWe depend on data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks over the Internet. A cyber-attack on our systems could result in the theft, loss or destruction of our information or the theft or improper use of confidential information about our customers, any of which could harm our reputation and expose us to financial losses. We cannot be certain all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards which have been installed. We also outsource certain key aspects of our data processing and communication to certain third-party providers. While we have selected these third-party providers carefully, we cannot control their actions or their degree of compliance with their own systems of internal control. If information security is breached, or one of our service providers or vendors breaches compliance procedures, our or our customers\u2019 information could be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damage to our customers or others. If information security is breached either on our systems or those of our vendors, our financial condition, results of operations, reputation and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nStrategic and External Risks\nThe Company may have difficulty continuing to grow, and even if we do grow, our growth may strain our resources and limit our ability to expand operations successfully.\nOur future profitability will depend in part on our continued ability to grow both loans and deposits; however, we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rate or be able to grow at all. In addition, our future success will depend on competitive factors and on the ability of our senior management to continue to maintain an appropriate system of internal controls and procedures and manage a growing number of customer relationships. We may not be able to implement changes or improvements to these internal controls and procedures in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Consequently, continued growth, if achieved, may place a strain on our operational infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces competition from other financial institutions.\nThe banking and financial services business in our market area continues to be a highly competitive field and is becoming more competitive as a result of:\n\u25cf\nchanges in regulations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in technology and product delivery systems;\n\u25cf\nthe accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers; and\n\u25cf\nfinancial technology, or fintech, companies emerging in key areas of banking.\nIt may be difficult for us to compete effectively in the market, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by the nature or pace of change in competition. We compete for loans, deposits and customers with various bank and non-bank financial services providers, many of which are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, offer a broader array of financial services or, in the case of credit unions, do not pay federal income taxes. Our strategic planning efforts continue to focus on capitalizing on our strengths in local markets while working to identify opportunities for improvement to gain competitive advantages.\nFederal Government spending and increase in monetary supply could adversely affect our business.\nThe banking and financial services business is negatively affected by increased federal government spending and increases in monetary supply. The increase in the balances of customers deposit accounts due to government stimulus programs and increase in the monetary supply puts a strain on the Company\u2019s capital ratios. The increase in the money supply also keeps interest rates at historically low levels and may cause inflation. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by these changes if continued over a period of time.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, acquire other financial institutions or bank offices when we believe such acquisitions support our business strategy. Acquisitions involve many risks including: (i) incurring time and expense associated with identifying, evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions, resulting in management\u2019s attention being diverted from operation of our existing business, (ii) the risk that the acquired business will not perform to our expectations, including a failure to realize anticipated synergies or costs savings, (iii) entering markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience, (iv) difficulties or increased expenses associated with integrating the operations of the acquired business, (v) the potential for claims or unexpected liabilities arising out of the acquired business, and (vi) the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions we may undertake.\nCurrent and future government regulations may increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business.\nCurrent and future legislation and the policies established by federal and state regulatory authorities will affect our operations. We are subject to extensive supervision of, and examination by, federal and state regulatory authorities which may limit our growth and the return to our shareholders by restricting certain activities, such as:\n\u25cf\nthe payment of dividends to our shareholders;\n\u25cf\nthe payment of dividends to the Company by the Banks;\n\u25cf\npossible mergers with or acquisitions of or by other institutions;\n\u25cf\ninvestment policies;\n\u25cf\nloans and interest rates on loans;\n\u25cf\ninterest rates paid on deposits;\n\u25cf\nexpansion of branch offices; and/or\n\u25cf\nthe ability to provide or expand securities or trust services.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and, among many other things, established the federal CFPB and required the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many significant rules and regulations with which we must comply. Compliance with the law and regulations has resulted in additional costs, and not all the rules and regulations have been finalized.\nWe cannot predict what changes, if any, will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that any changes may have on future business and earnings prospects, although the pace of the new and proposed regulations has slowed. The cost of compliance with future regulatory requirements may adversely affect our net income.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses. In particular, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on our customers that are directly or indirectly engaged in industries that could be affected by the pandemic, such as, hospitality and fitness clubs. Their businesses may be adversely affected by quarantines and travel restrictions in areas most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, entire industries, such as agriculture, may be adversely impacted due to lower exports caused by reduced economic activity in the affected areas. As a result, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic may materially and adversely impact various aspects of our operations and financial results, by requiring us to take certain responsive actions, including but not limited to, increasing our loan loss reserves, incurring costs for emergency preparedness, closing branch offices or branch operations, and significant illnesses among our staff or requiring that employees work remotely, which may lead to personnel shortages. The occurrence of any of the events in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks related to the Company\u2019s Stock\nThe Company may not pay dividends on its common stock in the future.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. However, our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, we are a bank holding company, and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends depends primarily on our receipt of dividends from our Banks, the payment of which is subject to numerous limitations under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. See \"Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Dividends.\" As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nRisk related to volatility of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market is relatively limited compared to those of companies with larger capitalization listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the NASDAQ Global Markets, the New York Stock Exchange or other consolidated reporting systems or stock exchanges. A change in the supply or demand for our common stock, or other events affecting our business, may have a more significant impact on the price of our stock than would be the case for more actively traded companies. The Company\u2019s stock is no longer included as a component of the Russell 3000 Index as of June 2021 due to the reconstitution of the Index based on market capitalization.", "PERMNO": 90470, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ATLO"}
