RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception, including net losses of $33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $133.6 million. To date, we have not commercialized any products or generated any revenues from the sale of products, and we do not expect to generate any product revenues in the foreseeable future. We do not know whether or when we will generate revenue or become profitable.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our clinical and preclinical development activities related to our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant. Overall, we expect our research and development expenses to be substantial and to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical investigation of our current and future products. Our lead product candidate, Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, is currently being studied in a pivotal probable benefit study and, as a result, we expect that it could be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant or other products, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our products have received approval, our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors and other factors.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing net losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u2022 continue our pivotal probable benefit study of Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant;\n\u2022 continue the research and development of our other product candidates;\n\u2022 have our product candidates manufactured for clinical trials and for commercial sale;\n\u2022 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022 maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022 continue our research and development efforts for new product opportunities.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing our product candidates with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, developing additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product\ncandidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the initial stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of our Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our Company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which will affect our ability to obtain future financing and may require us to curtail our operations.\nOur financial statements as of December 31, 2015 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2015 financial statements, in their report, included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses since inception and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.2 million. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue.\nWe will need additional funding in the future. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we conduct our pivotal probable benefit study of, and seek regulatory approval for, our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our consolidated cash balance was approximately $20.2 million. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents are adequate to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in their report on our financial statements. Our future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical studies for our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant and any other product candidates that we may develop or acquire;\n\u2022 future clinical trial results of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant;\n\u2022 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant if our pivotal probable benefit study is successful, and the outcome of regulatory review of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant;\n\u2022 the cost and timing of future commercialization activities for our products, if any of our product candidates are approved for marketing, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u2022 the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022 the cost of having our product candidates manufactured for clinical trials in preparation for regulatory approval and in preparation for commercialization;\n\u2022 the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our product candidates;\n\u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u2022 the cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022 the efforts and activities of competitors and potential competitors;\n\u2022 the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022 the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and if we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not be able to continue as a going concern\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates on unfavorable terms to us.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and other third-party funding alternatives including license and collaboration agreements. To raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock which will dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or that may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant or any other product candidates that we develop or acquire.\nWe license certain technology underlying the development of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold from BCH and MIT, and the loss of the license would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results and cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe license technology from BCH and MIT that is integrated into our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant under an exclusive license. Under the license agreement, we have agreed to milestone payments and to meet certain reporting obligations. In the event that we were to breach any of the obligations under the agreement and fail to timely cure, BCH and MIT would have the right to terminate the agreement upon notice. In addition, BCH and MIT have the right to terminate our license upon the bankruptcy or receivership of the Company. If we are unable to continue to use or license this technology on reasonable terms, or if this technology fails to operate properly, we may not be able to secure alternatives in a timely manner and our ability to develop our products could be harmed.\nWe depend heavily on the success of one product candidate, Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, which is currently being studied in a pivotal probable benefit study. Even if we obtain favorable clinical results, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant.\nWe currently have only one product candidate, Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, in clinical development, and our business depends almost entirely on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of that product candidate, which may never occur. We currently have no products available for sale, generate no revenues from sales of any products, and we may never be able to develop marketable products. Our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, which is currently being studied in an ongoing pivotal probable benefit study, will require substantial additional clinical development, testing, manufacturing process development, and regulatory approval before we are permitted to commence its commercialization. Our other product candidate, Bioengineered Neural Trails\u2122, is in preclinical development. The clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approval via the HDE pathway for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment. Alternatively, if we were to seek PMA approval for our product candidates, that would require demonstration that the product is safe and effective for use in each target indication. This process can take many years. Of the large number of medical devices in development in the United States, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite capital to continue to fund our development and clinical programs, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant or any other product candidate..\nWe may experience delays in our ongoing pivotal probable benefit study for our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, and we do not know whether future clinical trials of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, or other future product candidates, will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, we must complete the pivotal probable benefit study. Our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant is currently being studied in a 20 subject pivotal study under our approved IDE application for the treatment of complete traumatic acute spinal cord injury. Our preclinical testing to date has been limited in nature and we cannot predict whether more extensive clinical testing will obtain similar results. Even though the initial\nresults of our clinical studies in humans are promising, our results may subsequently fail to meet the safety and efficacy standards required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our pivotal probable benefit study may not be successfully completed or may take longer than anticipated because of any number of factors, including potential delays in the enrollment of subjects in the study, the availability of scaffolds to supply to our clinical sites, failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, or unforeseen safety issues.\nIn additional, clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u2022 obtain regulatory approval to commence future clinical trials;\n\u2022 reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022 obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u2022 recruit, enroll and retain patients through the completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022 maintain clinical sites in compliance with trial protocols through the completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022 address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of the trial;\n\u2022 initiate or add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or\n\u2022 manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the relevant IRBs at the sites at which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, or changes in laws or regulations. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical studies, which could delay or prevent clinical studies of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical studies of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical studies depends on the speed at which we can enroll patients to participate in testing our product candidates. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical studies as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical studies, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nPatient enrollment is affected by a number of factors including:\n\u2022 severity of the disease or condition under investigation;\n\u2022 design of the study protocol;\n\u2022 size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022 eligibility criteria for and design of the study in question;\n\u2022 perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022 proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022 availability of competing therapies and clinical studies;\n\u2022 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical studies;\n\u2022 patient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u2022 ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical studies if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical studies required by regulatory agencies. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical studies as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical studies, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of new medical devices do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. The design of our clinical trials is based on many assumptions about the expected effects of our product candidates, and if those assumptions are incorrect, the trials may not sufficiently produce results to support regulatory applications. We are currently pursuing marketing approval via our HDE which requires us to show the device does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and that the probable benefit of health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use. Preliminary results may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the detailed results of an early clinical trial. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show safety and probable benefit sufficient to support intended use claims despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. The data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate's profile. Because of the uncertainties associated with clinical development and regulatory approval, we cannot determine if or when we will have an approved product for commercialization or achieve sales or profits.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nOur medical device and biologic products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Government regulation of medical devices and biologic products is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:\n\u2022 design, development and manufacturing;\n\u2022 testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;\n\u2022 clinical trials;\n\u2022 product safety;\n\u2022 marketing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022 regulatory clearances and approvals including premarket clearance and approval;\n\u2022 conformity assessment procedures;\n\u2022 product traceability and record keeping procedures;\n\u2022 advertising and promotion;\n\u2022 product complaints, complaint reporting, recalls and field safety corrective actions;\n\u2022 post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u2022 post-market studies; and\n\u2022 product import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated medical device product in the United States, we must obtain clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), approval of a PMA application, or approval of a HDE, unless the device is specifically exempt from premarket review. Our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant is expected to be regulated by the FDA as a Class III medical device, requiring either PMA or HDE approval. A HUD designation was granted for the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant in 2013, opening the HDE pathway.\nIn the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval. The process of obtaining a PMA is costly and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained.\nAn HDE application is similar in form and content to a PMA application and, although exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA, an HDE does require sufficient information for FDA to determine that the device does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use. Like a PMA, changes to HDE devices generally need FDA approval.\nBiological products must satisfy the requirements of the Public Health Services Act and its implementing regulations. In order for a biologic product to be legally marketed in the U.S., the product must have a BLA approved by the FDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a product for many reasons, including:\n\u2022 we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u2022 the data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and\n\u2022 the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis.\nIn addition, even after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct postmarketing studies. Failure to conduct\nrequired studies in a timely manner could result in the revocation of approval for the product that is subject to such a requirement and could also result in the recall or withdrawal of the product, which would prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as:\n\u2022 warning letters;\n\u2022 fines;\n\u2022 injunctions;\n\u2022 civil penalties;\n\u2022 termination of distribution;\n\u2022 recalls or seizures of products;\n\u2022 delays in the introduction of products into the market;\n\u2022 total or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022 refusal of the FDA or other regulator to grant future clearances or approvals;\n\u2022 withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and/or\n\u2022 in the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must obtain FDA approval before we can sell any of our products in the United States and approval of similar regulatory authorities in countries outside the United States before we can sell our products in such countries. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our products if such approval is denied or delayed.\nThe development, manufacture and marketing of our products are subject to government regulation in the United States and other countries. In the United States and most foreign countries, we must complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive human clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product. If the FDA grants regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to its distribution. Expanded or additional indications for approved devices may not be approved, which could limit our potential revenues. Foreign regulatory authorities may apply similar limitations or may refuse to grant any approval. Consequently, even if we believe that preclinical and clinical data are sufficient to support regulatory approval for our products, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not ultimately grant approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction. If our products are not approved, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our business will be adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with pursuing FDA approval via an HDE pathway, including the possibility that the approval could be withdrawn in the future if FDA subsequently approves another device for the same intended use, as well as limitations on the ability to profit from sales of the product.\nExcept in certain circumstances, products approved under an HDE cannot be sold for an amount that exceeds the costs of research and development, fabrication, and distribution of the device (i.e., for\nprofit). Currently, a product is only eligible to be sold for profit after receiving HDE approval if the device (1) is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that occurs in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation, and such device is labeled for use in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation in which the disease or condition occurs; or (2) is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that does not occur in pediatric patients or that occurs in pediatric patients in such numbers that the development of the device for such patients is impossible, highly impracticable or unsafe. If an HDE-approved device does not meet either of the eligibility criteria, the device cannot be sold for profit.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain regulatory clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA. In particular, we and our third-party suppliers will be required to comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation or QSRs. These FDA regulations cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to QSR requirements, this could delay production of our product candidates and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we and our suppliers are required to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, and Good Tissue Practices, or GTPs, with respect to any human cells and biologic products we may develop, and International Standards Organization, or ISO, regulations for the manufacture of our products and other regulations which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval. Manufacturing may also be subject to controls by the FDA for parts of the combination products that FDA may find are controlled by the biologics regulations.\nThe FDA audits compliance with the QSR and other similar regulatory requirements through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022 untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022 unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022 customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022 operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022 refusing or delaying our requests for premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u2022 withdrawing PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022 refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022 criminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our medical device products, or malfunction of our medical device products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury before or after approval, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers with approved products are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. Any such serious adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. In the context of our ongoing clinical trial, we report adverse events in accordance with IDE regulations. No serious adverse events involving our products have been reported in the past, however we cannot guarantee that such events will not occur in the future. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, and either pre- or post-market, needed to address any serious adverse events will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nIn addition, if our products are approved for commercialization, the FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our partners could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our commercialized products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers' demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nFurther, under the FDA's medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we obtain approval for our products, we may be subject to enforcement action if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of our products.\nWe are not permitted to promote or market our investigational products. After approval, our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, use. Surgeons may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a surgeon's choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our\npromotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management's attention, result in substantial damage awards against us, and harm our reputation.\nSome of our future products will be viewed by the FDA as combination products comprised of a biologic and medical device component, and the review of combination products is often more complex and more time consuming than the review of other types of products.\nIt is possible that some of our products, including our Bioengineered Neural Trails injection, may be regulated by the FDA as combination products. For a combination product, the FDA must determine which center or centers within the FDA will review the product candidate and under what legal authority the product candidate will be reviewed. We are currently developing our regulatory strategies with respect to which regulatory pathway will be necessary to obtain clearance or approval, if medical device clearance or approval is required at all. We believe that the biologic component, as well as the associated biomaterial component, of the Bioengineered Neural Trails injection will be reviewed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. The delivery tools associated with that product may be reviewed by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH either in consultation with CBER as part of the Biologics License Application, or BLA, or separately as a medical device. The process of obtaining FDA marketing clearance or approval is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain, and we cannot be sure that our biologic-device combination products, or any other products, will be cleared or approved in a timely fashion, or at all. In addition, the review of combination products is often more complex and more time consuming than the review of a product candidate under the jurisdiction of only one center within the FDA. We cannot be sure that the FDA will not select to have our combination products reviewed and regulated by only one FDA center and/or different legal authority, in which case the path to regulatory approval would be different and could be more lengthy and costly. If the FDA does not approve or clear our products in a timely fashion, or at all, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot protect, maintain and, if necessary, enforce our intellectual property rights, our ability to develop and commercialize products will be adversely impacted.\nOur success, in large part, depends on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our technology. We and our licensors must prosecute and maintain our existing patents and obtain new patents. Some of our proprietary information may not be patentable, and there can be no assurance that others will not utilize similar or superior solutions to compete with us. We cannot guarantee that we will develop proprietary products that are patentable, and that if issued, any patent will give a competitive advantage or that such patent will not be challenged by third parties. The process of obtaining patents can be time consuming with no certainty of success, as a patent may not issue or may not have sufficient scope or strength to protect the intellectual property it was intended to protect. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will suffice or that our others will not independently develop competitive technology or design around patents or other intellectual property rights issued to us. Even if a patent is issued, it does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable. Any patents that we or our licensors have obtained or obtain in the future may be challenged, invalidated or unenforceable. If necessary, we may initiate actions to protect our intellectual property, which can be costly and time consuming.\nIf third parties successfully claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, our ability to continue to develop and commercialize products could be delayed or prevented.\nThird parties may claim that we or our licensors are infringing on or misappropriating their proprietary information. Other organizations are engaged in research and product development efforts that may overlap with our products. Such third parties may currently have, or may obtain in the future, legally blocking proprietary rights, including patent rights, in one or more products or methods under development or consideration by us. These rights may prevent us from commercializing products, or may require us to obtain a license from the organizations to use the technology. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses that may be required on reasonable financial terms, if at all, and cannot be sure that the patents underlying any such licenses will be valid or enforceable. There may be rights that we are not aware of, including applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research and development of the product that is the subject of the suit. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our trade secrets or other confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe will face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nIn general, the biotechnology industry is subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major drug companies, specialized biotechnology firms, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources than us, and superior experience and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, design and implementation of clinical trials, regulatory processes and approval for products, production and manufacturing, and sales and marketing of approved products. Large and established companies compete in the biotechnology market. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, manufacturing such products on a broad scale and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they have collaborative arrangements with larger and more established biotechnology companies. We will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and registering subjects for clinical trials.\nIn order to effectively compete, we will have to make substantial investments in development, clinical testing, manufacturing and sales and marketing, or partner with one or more established companies. There is no assurance that we will be successful in having our products approved or gaining significant market share for any of our products. Our technologies and products also may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive as a result of products introduced by our competitors.\nWe will depend upon strategic relationships to develop, exploit and manufacture our products. If these relationships are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these products.\nThe near and long-term viability of our products will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with biotechnology companies, hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies. Establishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. If we fail to establish a sufficient number of collaborations on acceptable\nterms, we may not be able to commercialize our products or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts.\nEven if we establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any of our product candidates for reasons both within and outside of our control.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant for clinical-study scale and no experience for commercial scale.\nTo date, we have manufactured our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant on a small scale, including sufficient supply that is needed for our clinical studies. We may encounter unanticipated problems in the scale-up process that will result in delays in the manufacturing of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, and therefore, delay our clinical studies. During our clinical trials, we are subject to FDA regulations requiring manufacturing of our scaffolds with the FDA requirements for design controls and subject to inspections by regulatory agencies. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in delays and interruptions to our product supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements. If we are unable to scale up our manufacturing to meet requirements for our clinical studies, we may be required to rely on contract manufacturers. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product ourselves, including the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control, and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities.\nThere are a limited number of suppliers that can provide materials to us. Any problems encountered by such suppliers may detrimentally impact us.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and vendors for certain of the materials used in the manufacture of our products or other of our product candidates. Any significant problem experienced by one of our suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until such supplier resolves the problem or an alternative source of supply is located. Any delay or interruption could negatively affect our operations.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our laboratory testing, animal and human clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our products.\nWe have been, and will continue to be, dependent on third-party CROs, medical institutions, investigators, and contract laboratories to conduct certain of our laboratory testing, animal and human clinical studies. We are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our approved plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or successfully commercialize our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected..\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nOur ongoing research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. We are currently conducting a pivotal study of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant to gather information about the product's safety and probable benefit. In the future we may conduct clinical trials to support approval of new products. Clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations or the FDA may take enforcement action. The data collected from these clinical studies may ultimately be used to support market clearance for these products. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims or that the FDA will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and preclinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate's profile.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials and commercialization, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic collaborators, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, if approved, and any other product candidates, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and, if necessary, sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our Company.\nIf approved, our products will require market acceptance to be successful. Failure to gain market acceptance would impact our revenues and may materially impair our ability to continue our business.\nEven if we receive regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our products, the commercial success of our products will depend on, among other things, their acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors such as health insurance companies and other members of the medical community as a therapeutic and cost-effective alternative to competing products and treatments. Physicians and hospitals will need to establish training and procedures to utilize and implement our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant, and there can be no assurance that these parties will adopt the use of our device or develop sufficient training and procedures to properly utilize it. Market acceptance of, and demand for, any product that we may develop and commercialize will depend on many factors, both within and outside of our control. If our product candidates fail to gain market acceptance, we may be unable to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nIf we obtain approval for our products, their commercial success will depend in part upon the level of reimbursement we receive from third parties for the cost of our products to users.\nThe commercial success of any product will depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs, and other organizations. Adequate third-party insurance coverage may not be available for us to establish and maintain price levels that are sufficient for us to continue our business or for realization of an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nAcquisitions of companies, businesses or technologies may substantially dilute our stockholders and increase our operating losses.\nWe may make acquisitions of businesses, technologies or intellectual property rights that we believe would to be necessary, useful or complementary to our current business. Any such acquisition may require assimilation of the operations, products or product candidates and personnel of the acquired business and the training and integration of its employees, and could substantially increase our operating costs, without any offsetting increase in revenue. Acquisitions may not provide the intended technological, scientific or business benefits and could disrupt our operations and divert our limited resources and management's attention from our current operations, which could harm our existing product development efforts. While we may use cash or equity to finance a future acquisition, it is likely we would issue equity securities as a portion or all of the consideration in any acquisition. The issuance of equity securities for an acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. Any investment made in, or funds advanced to, a potential acquisition target could also significantly adversely affect our results of operation and could further reduce our limited capital resources. Any acquisition or action taken in anticipation of a potential acquisition or other change in business activities could substantially depress the price of our stock. In addition, our results of operations may suffer because of acquisition related costs or the post-acquisition costs of funding the development of an acquired technology or product candidates or operation of the acquired business, or due to amortization or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our management and other key personnel.\nWe depend on our senior management as well as key scientific personnel. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research, development or business objectives. Competition for qualified employees is intense among biotechnology companies, and the loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees could hinder our ability to successfully develop marketable products.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled scientific, technical, marketing, managerial and financial personnel. Although we will seek to hire and retain qualified personnel with experience and abilities commensurate with our needs, there is no assurance that we will succeed despite our collective efforts. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel could hinder our ability to fulfill our business plan and further develop and commercialize our products and services. Competition for personnel is intense, and any failure to attract and retain the necessary technical, marketing, managerial and financial personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from collaborators, prospective licensees and other third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees' former employers. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nWe are subject to a pending securities class action and derivative lawsuit, which could divert management's attention and harm our business.\nWe are the subject of a securities class action lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed in July 2014, alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements related to the timing and completion of the clinical study of our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold implant. That lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in April 2015. Plaintiffs filed an appeal of that dismissal, which will be heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on April 6, 2016. No assurance can be provided that we will be successful in defending against this appeal or, if the dismissal is overturned, in defending the underlying lawsuit. Nor can we be certain that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover any liability under such claims.\nWe are also the subject of a securities derivative lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed in August 2015, alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the claimed false and misleading statements that are the subject of the securities class action. That lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in February 2016. The time for filing an appeal of that dismissal has not yet expired. If an appeal of the dismissal is filed, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in defending against the appeal or, if the dismissal is overturned, in defending the underlying lawsuit. Nor can we be certain that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover any liability under such claims.\nFurther, the amount of time that will be required to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and these actions may divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face potential product liability claims, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs.\nWe will have exposure to claims for product liability. Product liability coverage for the healthcare industry is expensive and sometimes difficult to obtain. We may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or be able to secure increased coverage if the commercialization of our products progresses, nor can we be sure that existing or future claims against us will be covered by our product liability insurance. Moreover, the existing coverage of our insurance policy or any rights of indemnification and contribution that we may have may not be sufficient to offset existing or future claims. A successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable terms, if at all. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a\nclaim would be time-consuming and expensive, may damage our reputation in the marketplace, and would likely divert our management's attention.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws. Failure to comply with such environmental, health and safety laws could cause us to become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and humans, emissions and wastewater discharges, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research. Any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research and development efforts.\nRisks Related to Investment in Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock may become volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u2022 the status, completion and/or results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022 announcements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory actions regarding our products;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 1,156,979 shares of our common stock, and outstanding options to purchase 3,253,310 shares of our common stock. We expect to issue additional equity awards to compensate employees, consultants and directors, and may issue additional shares to raise capital, to acquire other companies or technologies, to pay for services, or for other corporate purposes. Any such issuances will have the effect of diluting the interest of current stockholders. The future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be\nrequired to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are currently quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and Nevada state law may discourage or prevent a takeover.\nOur articles of incorporation divide our Board of Directors into three classes, with three-year staggered terms. The classified board provision could increase the likelihood that, in the event an outside party acquired a controlling block of our stock, incumbent directors nevertheless would retain their positions for a substantial period, which may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. In addition, Nevada has a business combination law, which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and \"interested stockholders\" for three years after the interested stockholder first becomes an interested stockholder, unless the corporation's board of directors approves the combination in advance. In addition, we may become subject to Nevada's control share laws. A corporation is subject to Nevada's control share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and if the corporation does business in Nevada, including through an affiliated corporation. This control share law may have the effect of discouraging corporate takeovers. Currently, we believe that we have less than 100 stockholders of record who are residents of Nevada, and are therefore not subject to the control share laws.\nThe provisions of our articles of incorporation and Nevada's business combination and control share laws make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in our stockholders' interest or might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15297, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NVIV"}
