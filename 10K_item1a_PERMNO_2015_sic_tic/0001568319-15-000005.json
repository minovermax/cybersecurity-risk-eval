{"cik": "1568319", "company": "Voltari Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See \"Special Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" appearing at the beginning of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that are currently deemed immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. We undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWe are focused on our mobile media business and have discontinued our wireless carrier business and our messaging business in the U.S. and Canada. If we are unable to successfully realign our business to focus on our mobile media business, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nHistorically, we depended on a limited number of significant wireless carriers, such as AT&T and Verizon, for a substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows. The discontinuation of our carrier and messaging business could result in lower revenues than expected and increased business development, marketing and sales expenses, and cause our business to be less profitable and our results of operations to be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our mobile media business and generate sufficient revenues from our other customers.\nWe have a history of net operating losses and may continue to suffer losses in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we had net losses of approximately $7.0 million, $195.4 million, $34.2 million, $10.3 million and $29.3 million, respectively. If we cannot become profitable, our financial condition will deteriorate further, and we may be unable to achieve our business objectives.\nOur product development investments may not lead to successful new services or enhancements.\nWe expect to continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing services designed to improve the quality of the services delivered to our customers. Particularly with our increased emphasis on the mobile enterprise and marketing business, we must also continue to provide new products and services while we continue to develop existing features based on specific customer requests and anticipated market needs. Research and development in the mobile data services industry, however, is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we are not able to expend sufficient capital on such research and development or if our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of service enhancements that are competitive in the marketplace, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and market share.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe market for digital media and marketing services is highly competitive, with numerous companies providing competing services. We compete with, among others, Google Inc. and Apple Inc., both of which are significantly larger than we are and have more capital to invest in their digital media and marketing businesses. They, or other companies that offer competing digital media solutions, may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with their mobile operator partners, brand advertisers, app developers or other parties, thereby limiting our ability to promote our services and generate revenue. Competitors could also seek to gain market share from us by reducing the prices they charge to advertisers and other customers. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, exchange or other third-party services may also become intermediaries between mobile advertisers and thereby compete with us. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our services and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share.\nThe market for mobile media and marketing services may deteriorate or develop more slowly than expected, which could harm our business.\nAdvertising and marketing using mobile connected devices is still a relatively new business activity. Advertisers have historically spent a smaller portion of their marketing and advertising budgets on mobile media as compared to traditional methods, such as television, newspapers, radio and billboards, or online advertising over the internet, such as placing banner ads on websites. Future demand and market acceptance for mobile media services is uncertain. Many advertisers still have limited experience with mobile advertising and may continue to devote larger portions of their advertising budgets to more traditional offline or online personal computer-based advertising, instead of shifting additional advertising resources to mobile advertising. In addition, our current and potential advertiser and marketing clients may ultimately find mobile media services to be less effective than traditional advertising media or marketing methods or other technologies for promoting their products and services, and may, consequently, reduce their spending on mobile media from current levels. If the market for mobile advertising deteriorates, or develops more slowly than we expect, we may not be able to increase our revenue.\nThe rights offering resulted in Mr. Carl C. Icahn becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of our company, which constitutes a redemption event under the terms of our Series J Preferred Stock, pursuant to which the holders of the Series J preferred stock may require us to redeem their shares, which may cause our common stockholders to lose their entire investment.\nThe holders of our Series J preferred stock may require us to redeem their shares of Series J preferred stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference per share in effect at such time plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the next dividend payment date after the redemption date, in connection with a redemption event, including a change in control which results in a person becoming the beneficial owner of at least 50% of the voting power of the Company. Following the completion, and as a result of, the rights offering on March 30, 2015, entities affiliated with Mr. Carl C. Icahn, the Company\u2019s largest stockholder, became the owner of approximately 52.3% of the voting power of our common stock, which constitutes a change of control, which in turn constitutes a redemption event pursuant to the terms of the Series J preferred stock. As a result, each holder of shares of the Series J preferred stock has the right to require us to redeem its shares of Series J preferred stock. Mr. Carl C. Icahn beneficially owns approximately 95.5% of the Series J preferred stock. Mr. Carl C. Icahn has agreed to waive the right to require the Company to redeem shares of Series J preferred stock that he beneficially owns. As of March 31, 2015 the liquidation preference on the outstanding shares of Series J preferred stock is $41.2 million and the the redemption price of the Series J preferred stock is $34.37 per share. If all holders of shares of Series J preferred stock, except for entities affiliated with Mr. Carl C. Icahn, require us to redeem their shares of Series J preferred stock, we will be required to pay an aggregate redemption price equal to $1.8 million as of March 30, 2015, subject to the State of Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders. Shares of Series J preferred stock which are not redeemed, at the option of the holder, will remain outstanding and will continue to accrue quarterly dividends equal to 3.25% of the liquidation preference then in effect. Dividends declared or accrued on the Series J preferred stock reduce the amount of net earnings that are available to common stockholders.\nOur business is dependent on the continued growth in usage of smartphones, tablets and other mobile connected devices.\nOur business depends on the continued proliferation of mobile connected devices, such as smartphones and tablets, that can connect to the internet over a cellular, wireless or other network, as well as the increased consumption of content through those devices. Consumer usage of these mobile connected devices may be inhibited for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u2022\ninadequate network infrastructure to support advanced features beyond just mobile web access;\n\u2022\nusers' concerns about the security of these devices;\n\u2022\ninconsistent quality of wireless connections;\n\u2022\nunavailability of cost-effective, high-speed internet service; and\n\u2022\nchanges in network carrier pricing plans that charge device users based on the amount of data consumed.\nFor any of these reasons, users of mobile connected devices may limit the amount of time they spend on these devices and the number of apps they download on these devices. If user adoption of mobile connected devices and consumer consumption of content on those devices do not continue to grow, our total addressable market size may be significantly limited, which could compromise our ability to increase our revenue and to become profitable.\nIf mobile connected devices, their operating systems or content distribution channels develop in ways that prevent our services from being delivered to their users, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\nOur business model depends upon the continued compatibility of our service offerings with most mobile connected devices, as well as the major operating systems that run on them and the thousands of apps that are downloaded onto them. The design of mobile devices and operating systems is controlled by third parties with whom we do not have any formal relationships. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers, such as Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile, may also take steps to limit their customers' ability to download apps or access specified content on mobile devices.\nIn some cases, the parties that control the development of mobile connected devices and operating systems include companies that are our competitors. For example, Apple controls two of the most popular mobile devices, the iPhone and the iPad, as well as the iOS operating system that runs on them. Apple also controls the App Store for downloading apps that run on Apple's mobile devices. Similarly, Google controls the Android operating system. If we were unable to service these devices or operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because a maker of these devices or developer of these operating systems wished to impair our ability to provide ads on them, our ability to generate revenue could be significantly harmed.\nOur industry is undergoing rapid change, and our business model is also evolving, which makes it difficult to predict our future prospects.\nThe placement of advertising on websites and in mobile apps has largely been effected through a series of intermediaries between the publishers owning the sites and apps and the advertisers. These intermediaries include \u201csupply-side\u201d businesses aggregating publisher inventory, \u201cneutral\u201d media exchanges and \u201cdemand-side\u201d businesses such as ours acting on behalf of advertisers either directly or through their advertising agencies. A significant portion of the money spent by digital advertisers goes to these intermediaries in the form of resale profits or fees, which has the effect of both increasing the costs to advertisers and reducing publisher yields on inventory. Increasingly, advertisers and publishers are taking steps to reduce the number of intermediaries included in the digital ad chain with many advertisers using in-house resources to place advertising directly with publishers or through direct participation in media exchanges. This trend is likely to continue and significantly reduce our and our competitors\u2019 revenue opportunities. We need to identify and exploit new revenue-generating opportunities and we are exploring the entry into new businesses, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors.\nWe may not be able to enhance our service offerings to keep pace with technological and market developments.\nThe market for digital media services is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new service introductions. To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements, maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of our solutions and ensure compatibility with evolving industry standards and protocols, we will need to regularly enhance our current services and to develop and introduce new services on a timely basis. Our inability, for technological, business or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce and deliver compelling services in response to changing market conditions and technologies or evolving expectations of advertisers or device users could hurt our ability to grow our business and could result in our platform becoming obsolete.\nWe do not control the mobile networks over which we provide our mobile services.\nOur mobile media and marketing business is dependent on the reliability of network operators and carriers who maintain sophisticated and complex mobile networks, as well as our ability to deliver ads and services on those networks at prices that enable us to realize a profit. Mobile networks have been subject to rapid growth and technological change, particularly in recent years. We do not control these networks.\nMobile networks could fail for a variety of reasons, including new technology incompatibility, the degradation of network performance under the strain of too many mobile consumers using the network, a general failure from natural disaster or a political or regulatory shut-down. Individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs could also attack mobile networks and the devices that run on those networks. Any actual or perceived security threat to mobile devices or any mobile network could lead existing and potential device users to reduce or refrain from mobile usage or reduce or refrain from responding to the services offered by our customers. If the network of a mobile operator should fail for any reason, we would not be able to effectively provide our services to our clients through that mobile network. This in turn could hurt our reputation and cause us to lose significant revenue.\nMobile carriers may also increase restrictions on the amounts or types of data that can be transmitted over their networks. We currently generate different amounts of revenue from our customers based on the kinds of ads we deliver, such as display ads, rich media ads or video ads. In some cases, we are paid by advertisers on a cost-per-thousand, or CPM, basis depending on the number of ads shown. In other cases, we are paid on a cost-per-click (CPC), cost-per-action (CPA) or cost-per-installation (CPI) basis depending on the actions taken by the mobile device user. Different types of ads or services consume differing amounts of bandwidth and network capacity. If a network carrier were to restrict the amounts of data that can be delivered on that carrier's network, or otherwise control the kinds of content that may be downloaded to a device that operates on the network, it could negatively affect our pricing practices and inhibit our ability to deliver targeted advertising or marketing to that carrier's users, both of which could impair our ability to generate revenue.\nMobile connected device users may choose not to allow advertising on their devices.\nThe success of our mobile media and marketing business depends on our ability to deliver targeted, highly relevant ads and services to consumers on their mobile connected devices. Targeting is effected primarily through analysis of data, much of which is collected on the basis of user-provided permissions. This data might include a device's location or data collected when device users view an ad, a message or a video or when they click on or otherwise engage with an ad. Users may elect not to allow data sharing for a number of reasons, such as privacy concerns, or pricing mechanisms that may charge the user based upon the amount or types of data consumed on the device. Users may also elect to opt out of receiving targeted advertising or marketing. The designers of mobile device operating systems are increasingly promoting features that allow device users to disable some of the functionality, which may impair or disable the delivery of ads or services on their devices, and device manufacturers may include these features as part of their standard device specifications. Although we are not aware of any such products that are widely used in the market today, as has occurred in the online advertising industry, companies may develop products that enable users to prevent ads or messages from appearing on their mobile device screens. If any of these developments were to occur, our ability to deliver effective campaigns on behalf of our advertising clients would suffer, which could hurt our ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nOur mobile media business depends on our ability to collect and use data, and any limitation on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose clients and revenue.\nWhen we deliver an ad or a service to a mobile device, we or our vendors are often able to collect anonymous information and the reactions of the mobile device user, such as whether the user visited a landing page or watched a video; we refer to this data as \u201cResponse Data.\u201d We and our vendors may also be able to collect information about the user's mobile location; we refer to this data as \"Location Data.\" As we and our vendors collect and aggregate Location and Response data provided by billions of ad impressions, it is analyzed in order to optimize the placement and scheduling of ads and the offer of services. For example, the collected information may be used to limit the number of times a specific ad or opportunity is presented to the same mobile device, to provide an ad or opportunity to only certain types of mobile devices, or to provide a report to an advertiser client on the number of its ads that were clicked.\nAlthough the Location and Response Data is not personally identifiable information, clients, vendors and mobile ad exchanges might decide not to allow the collection, or might limit its use. Any limitation on the collection and use of Location and Response Data could make it more difficult for us to deliver effective mobile advertising programs that meet the demands of our clients.\nAlthough our contracts with advertisers generally permit us to aggregate data from advertising campaigns, these clients might nonetheless request that we discontinue using data obtained from their campaigns that have already been aggregated with other clients' campaign data. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to comply with these requests, and these kinds of requests could also cause us to spend significant amounts of resources. Interruptions, failures or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis and storage systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions regarding the collection of data, could also limit our ability to aggregate and analyze mobile device user data from our clients' advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising or opportunities, which could make our services less valuable, and, as a result, we might lose clients and our revenue could decline.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to collect and use location-based information about mobile connected device users.\nOur business model depends in part upon the collection and use of Location Data to provide effective targeted advertising on behalf of our advertising clients. The use of Location Data could be restricted by a number of factors, including new laws or\nregulations, technology or consumer choice. Limitations on the collection or use of Location Data could limit our ability to target ads.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\nIn the course of providing our services, we and our vendors transmit and store information related to mobile devices, the ads we place and the services we deliver including Location and Response Data for the purpose of delivering targeted location-based ads or opportunities to the user of the device. Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we and our vendors collect. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy or consumer protection, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. We are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in our industry alleging various violations of privacy-related laws. These proceedings could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our services and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our clients from the costs or consequences of inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of providing our services.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is evolving, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at the mobile industry in particular. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect our business, particularly with regard to location-based services, collection or use of data to target ads and communication with consumers via mobile devices.\nThe U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection of consumer information, including regulation aimed at restricting some targeted advertising practices. The FTC has also proposed revisions to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, that could, if adopted, create greater compliance burdens on us. COPPA imposes a number of obligations, such as obtaining parental permission, on website operators to the extent they collect certain information from children who are under 13 years old. The proposed changes would broaden the applicability of COPPA, including the types of information that would be subject to these regulations, and could apply to information that we or our clients collect through mobile devices or apps that is not currently subject to COPPA.\nSeasonal fluctuations in digital advertising and marketing activity could adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur cash flows from operations could vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of our customers' spending. For example, many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period as a result.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with our customers, and we may be unable to retain key customers, attract new customers or replace departing customers with customers that can provide comparable revenue to us.\nOur success requires us to maintain and expand our current client relationships and to develop new relationships. Our contracts with our digital media customers generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our services and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. As a result, we may have limited visibility as to our future media revenue streams. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to use our services or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenue.\nOur media sales efforts require significant time and expense.\nAttracting new media clients requires substantial time and expense, and we may not be successful in establishing new relationships or in maintaining or advancing our current relationships. For example, it may be difficult to identify, engage and market to potential advertiser clients who do not currently spend on digital or mobile advertising or are unfamiliar with our current services or platform. Furthermore, many of our clients' purchasing and design decisions typically require input from\nmultiple internal constituencies. As a result, we must identify those involved in the purchasing decision and devote a sufficient amount of time to presenting our services to each of those individuals.\nWe often need to spend substantial time and effort educating potential mobile media clients about our offerings, including providing demonstrations and comparisons against other available services. This process can be costly and time-consuming. If we are not successful in streamlining our sales processes with advertisers, our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not achieve satisfactory results under performance-based pricing models, we could lose clients and our revenue could decline.\nWe offer our digital media services to customers based on a variety of pricing models, including CPM, CPA, CPC and CPI. We currently derive a significant portion of our media revenue from the CPM pricing model. Under performance-driven CPA and CPC pricing models, customers only pay us if we provide the results they specify. These results-based pricing models differ from fixed-rate pricing models, like CPM, under which the fee is based on the number of times the ad is shown, without regard to its effectiveness. As a result, under our contracts with customers that provide for us to be paid on a CPC, CPA or CPI basis, we must be able to develop effective ad campaigns that result in the desired actions being taken by consumers. If we are not able to perform effectively under these arrangements, it could hurt our reputation and could cause our revenues to decline.\nIf we fail to detect click fraud or other invalid clicks on ads or messages, we could lose the confidence of our mobile media clients, which would cause our business to suffer.\nOur digital media business relies on delivering positive results to our clients. We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent and other invalid clicks or conversions that clients may perceive as undesirable. Because of their smaller sizes as compared to personal computers, mobile device usage could result in a higher rate of accidental or otherwise inadvertent clicks by a user. Invalid clicks could also result from click fraud, where a mobile device user intentionally clicks on ads for reasons other than to access the underlying content of the ads. If fraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others, and we are unable to detect and prevent it, the affected customers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment. High levels of invalid click activity could lead to dissatisfaction with our services, refusals to pay, refund demands or withdrawal of future business. Any of these occurrences could damage our brand and lead to a loss of customers and revenue.\nSystem failures could significantly disrupt our operations and cause us to lose customers or advertising inventory.\nOur success depends on the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our own internal systems, as well as those of our vendors, which we utilize to place ads and opportunities, monitor the performance of advertising and marketing campaigns and manage our inventory of advertising space. Our revenue depends on the technological ability to deliver ads and opportunities and measure them on a CPM, CPC, CPA or CPI basis. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide services to clients, including technological failures affecting our ability to deliver ads quickly and accurately and to process mobile device users' responses to ads and opportunities, could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our services to advertisers and reduce our revenue. Our systems and our vendors' systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power outages, malicious human acts and natural disasters. In addition, any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive and may not be successful in preventing system failures.\nActivities of our customers could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us.\nOur customers' promotion of their products and services may not comply with federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to mobile communications. Failure of our clients to comply with federal, state or local laws or our policies could damage our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws. We may also be liable to third parties for content in the ads we deliver if the artwork, text or other content involved violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws. Although we generally receive assurance from our advertisers that their ads are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property included in an ad, and although we are normally indemnified by the advertisers, a third party or regulatory authority may still file a claim against us. Any such claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could also hurt our reputation within the mobile advertising industry. Further, if we are exposed to legal liability, we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, discontinue some of our services or otherwise expend significant resources.\nCompetition for our employees is intense and failure to retain and recruit skilled personnel could negatively affect our financial results as well as our ability to maintain relationships with clients, service existing and new contracts, and drive future growth.\nWe provide sophisticated data delivery platforms and services to our customers. To attract and retain customers and service our existing and new contracts, we believe we need to demonstrate professional acumen and build trust and strong relationships, and that we must retain, identify, recruit, and motivate new hardware and software engineers, programmers, technical support personnel and marketing and sales representatives. Competition is intense for skilled personnel with engineering, product development, technical and marketing and sales experience, and we may not be able to retain and/or recruit individuals that possess the necessary skills and experience, or we may not be able to employ these individuals on acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. Moreover, competition has been increasing the cost of hiring and retaining skilled professionals as, among other reasons, other companies in the technology sector may offer more compensation, particularly in the form of equity awards. Recent business challenges, the realignment of our strategic path, reductions in force and changes in our executive management team have also increased turnover of our skilled personnel and we may continue to experience such turnover in the future. Our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to retain current personnel and hire other skilled personnel.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the cash flows necessary to maintain and expand our operations and invest in our services could reduce our ability to continue normal operations. This could adversely affect our ability to continue normal operations and could result in the loss of your entire investment.\nOver the near term, we expect that the cost of operations and working capital requirements will continue to be our principal need for liquidity. In the long term, working capital requirements are expected to increase if we succeed in executing our longer term business plan and growing our digital media and advertising business and new predictive analytics service offerings. Our cash flows may be affected by many factors including the economic environment, competitive conditions in the digital marketing and advertising industries and the success of our strategic realignment. Our shortterm liquidity may also be adversely affected if, and to the extent that, our Series J preferred stock becomes redeemable.\nOur ability to execute on our short term and longer term business plan is contingent on our ability to raise additional capital. Further, our ability to execute our short term and longer term business plan is based on a number of assumptions which involve significant judgments and estimates of future performance, borrowing capacity and credit and equity finance availability, which cannot at all times be assured. Accordingly, we cannot assure that cash flows from operations and other internal and external sources of liquidity will at all times be sufficient for our cash requirements. Our ability to fund our capital needs also depends on our future operating performance, our ability to compensate for the loss of the substantial cash generated by our discontinued operations, our ability to successfully realign our costs and strategic path, the effect of any financing alternatives we may pursue and our ability to meet financial covenants under any indebtedness we may incur. We may also need to raise additional capital to execute our business plan, including capital to complete planned upgrades and enhancements to our products and services, increase our investment in capital equipment to support new and existing customers, extend our marketing and sales efforts, and make strategic acquisitions if attractive opportunities become available. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future operating performance, our ability to successfully realign our costs and strategic path, the time and cost of our service enhancements, the rate of growth of the digital media and marketing business, the rate of mobile data subscriber growth, the acceptance rate of mobile devices as multifunctional computing platforms, the demand for wireless applications, the time and cost of successfully entering into new customer contracts and the amount of investment needed to achieve our sales and marketing objectives. If necessary, we may need to consider actions and steps to improve our cash position and mitigate any potential liquidity shortfall, such as modifying our business plan, pursuing additional financing to the extent available, reducing capital expenditures, pursuing and evaluating other alternatives and opportunities to obtain additional sources of liquidity and other potential actions to reduce costs. We cannot assure that any of these actions would be successful, sufficient or available on favorable terms. Any inability to generate or obtain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our cash requirements at the level and times needed could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position.\nIf we raise additional capital in an equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock and/or Series J preferred stock could decline. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that further restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios. We may not be able to raise any additional capital that we may require on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our failure to do so could result in, among other things, a loss of our customers and a loss of your entire investment.\nOur historical financial statements may not be indicative of future performance.\nOur operating history includes business in geographic areas in which we are no longer active, all of which has resulted in revenue and profitability that may not be indicative of our future results of operations. As a result, the price of our common stock may be volatile.\nIn 2013, AT&T terminated material revenue-generating contracts with us, effective June 30, 2013. We assigned all of our rights and interests under our Verizon Portal Agreement to Opalhaven Corporation, also effective June 30, 2013. On October 31, 2013, we completed the sale of our Gen5 business. All operations related to our U.S. carrier and Gen5 businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOn May 30, 2014 we completed the sale of our messaging business in the U.S. and Canada. We completed the sale of our United Kingdom wireless carrier business on September 1, 2014. All of the operations related to the messaging business in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the UK wireless carrier business, are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Assets and liabilities of the messaging business in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the UK wireless carrier business are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2013.\nAs a result of the recent significant changes in our company, the termination of our carrier business, the sale of Gen5, our messaging business, and the UK wireless carrier business, the realignment of our strategic path and enhanced focus on our digital media and marketing business, our exploration of financing alternatives and other changes in our business, our historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating results of any future period.\nWe may not be able to realize value from our NOLs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal and state NOLs of $410.3 million and $67.5 million, respectively, that begin to expire in 2019 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in the current year for state income tax purposes. If we had an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d), our NOLs generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce, eliminate, or defer the utilization of these losses. Generally, an ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders, each of whom owns 5% or more in value of a corporation\u2019s stock, increase their aggregate percentage ownership by 50 percentage points or more as compared to the lowest percentage of stock owned by such stockholders at any time during the preceding three year period. Based upon a review of past changes in our ownership, we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change (as defined under Section 382) that would result in any limitation on our future ability to use these NOLs. There can be no assurance however that the IRS or some other taxing authority will not disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced such an ownership change, which would severely limit our ability to use our NOLs to offset future taxable income.\nOn April 9, 2013, our stockholders approved a holding company reorganization in which each share of what was then Motricity common stock was exchanged for one share of our common stock. Shares of our common stock are subject to transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation. In general, the transfer restrictions prohibit transfers having the effect of increasing without our consent the ownership of our common stock by (i) any person from less than 5% to 5% or more or (ii) any person owning or deemed to own 5% of more of our common stock.\nWhile we expect that the transfer restrictions will help guard against an ownership change occurring under Section 382 of the Code and the related rules, because we may use our common stock as consideration to make acquisitions and because we may decide (or need) to sell additional shares of our common stock in the future to raise capital for our business, we cannot guarantee that an ownership change will not occur in the future. Further, because our common stock warrants are not subject to the same exercise limits imposed on the subscription rights, the exercise of those common stock warrants or transfer of those common stock warrants to a person who would control the Company could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Unlike if we issued common stock as consideration in an acquisition or to raise additional capital, the exercise of the common stock warrants and, therefore, the resulting ownership shift, are out of our control.\nWe may engage in acquisitions, dispositions and exits that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may make selective domestic and international acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses that offer new products, services and technologies, augment our market coverage, and/or enhance our technological capabilities. Acquisitions and investments outside of the U.S. involve unique risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. We have ceased doing business in India, the Asia Pacific region, France, the Netherlands, Canada and the United Kingdom. Such dispositions or closures may have an adverse effect on our business. Acquisitions, dispositions and exits in the high-technology sector are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions, dispositions or exits will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, the integration of any business we acquire may require that we incur significant restructuring charges. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations, management information systems and internal controls, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly companies with overlapping business segments and widespread operations and/or complex products. Integration may be a difficult, drawn out process further complicated by such factors as geographic distances, lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business, delays and challenges associated with integrating the business with our existing businesses, diversion of management's attention from daily operations of the business, potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business, performance problems with the acquired business' technology, difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business, insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition, and our ability to achieve the growth prospects and synergies expected from any such acquisition. Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products and services, there can be no assurance that product or service enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such acquired assets.\nAny acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges, incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, increase our expenses and working capital requirements, and subject us to litigation, which would reduce our return on invested capital. Failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make could materially harm our business and operations. Any future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which in the case of debt financing, will increase our leverage and, in the case of equity financing, would be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Any decline in our perceived credit-worthiness associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition or disposition, and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur ongoing leadership transition could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOn March 26, 2013, Nathan Fong notified the Company that he would resign from his positions as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, effective April 12, 2013. On August 14, 2013, John Breeman commenced serving as the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. On December 20, 2013, Richard Stalzer resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Following the receipt of Mr. Stalzer's resignation, Richard Sadowsky, who had, since November 15, 2012 been serving as our Chief Administrative Officer as well as General Counsel, was appointed Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In connection with this appointment, Mr. Sadowsky relinquished his titles of Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel. The uncertainty inherent in our ongoing leadership transition can be difficult to manage, may cause concerns from current and potential customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, and may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key officers and employees. Our ongoing leadership transition could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe implemented cost saving measures in 2012, 2013 and 2015 and may implement additional cost saving measures in the future. If we are not successful in implementing future cost savings initiatives, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also experience an adverse impact on our business as a result of the reduction in force.\nIn the first quarter of 2012, we implemented a reduction in our global workforce as part of the overall realignment of our strategic path, our exit from India and the Asia Pacific region and our decision to sell our France and Netherlands subsidiaries. During the first half of 2013, we reduced, and by August of 2013 had eliminated, the portion of our workforce servicing the U.S. carrier\nbusiness. In early 2015, we significantly reduced the size of our workforce providing engineering and information technology services. We continue to review our cost structure and may implement further cost saving initiatives. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in implementing such initiatives, or that such efforts will not interfere with our ability to achieve our business objectives. Moreover, a reduction in force can be difficult to manage, may cause concerns from current and potential customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key employees, and may have an adverse impact on our business.\nAny material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or failure to maintain proper and effective internal controls could impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and investors' views of us could be harmed.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can manage our business and produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are required to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, until 2013 when we became a smaller reporting company under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we were required to provide a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing this assessment. Our compliance with Section 404 has required and will continue to require that we incur additional expense and expend management time on compliance-related issues. If we fail to maintain proper internal controls, our business could be adversely affected, our ability to predict our cash needs, and the market's confidence in our financial statements could decline and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology could be adversely affected.\nOur business relies upon certain unpatented or unregistered intellectual property rights and proprietary information. Consequently, although we take measures to keep our key intellectual property rights and proprietary information confidential, we may not be able to protect our technology from independent invention by third parties. We currently attempt to protect most of our key intellectual property through a combination of trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property laws and by entering into employee, contractor and business partner confidentiality agreements. Such measures, however, provide only limited protection, and under certain circumstances we may not be able to prevent the disclosure of our intellectual property, or the unauthorized use or reverse engineering or independent development of our technology. This may allow our existing and potential competitors to develop products and services that are competitive with, or superior to, our services. Further, we may choose to expand our international presence. Many of these countries' intellectual property laws are not as stringent as those of the U.S. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these countries from using or infringing our intellectual property rights, which would reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in these regions or otherwise harm our business. In the future, we may also have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources. There can be no assurance that such litigation will be successful.\nWe may not be able to make use of the existing tax benefits of the NOLs because we may not generate taxable income.\nThe use of the NOLs is subject to uncertainty because it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income generated by us and our consolidated subsidiaries. Through December 31, 2014 we have not generated taxable income on an annual basis, and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the NOLs before they begin expiring at varying dates starting in 2019 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in the current year for state income tax purposes.\nFuture legislation may impede our ability to realize the tax benefits of the NOLs.\nIt is possible that legislation or regulations will be adopted that would limit our ability to use the tax benefits associated with the NOLs. We are not aware, however, of any proposed changes in the tax laws or regulations that would materially affect our ability to use the NOLs.\nThe IRS could challenge the amount of the NOLs or claim that we experienced an ownership change, which could reduce the amount of NOLs that we can use.\nThe amount of the NOLs has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS could challenge the amount of the NOLs, which could result in an increase in our future income tax liability. In addition, calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of Section 382 and because of limitations on a publicly traded company's knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, we cannot assure you that a governmental authority will not claim that we experienced an ownership change and attempt to reduce or eliminate the benefit of the NOLs even if we are successful in implementing the protective measures subjecting our stock to transfer restrictions.\nWe use datacenters to deliver our platform and services and any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business.\nWe host our services and serve all of our customers (either directly or through third-party vendors) from various datacenter facilities located around the U.S. Several of our datacenter facilities are operated by third parties. We do not control the operations at the third-party facilities. All of these facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events. They also could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the third-party facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Although we maintain off-site tape backups of our customers' data, we do not currently operate or maintain a backup datacenter for any of our services, which increases our vulnerability to interruptions or delays in our services. Interruptions in our services might harm our reputation, reduce our revenue, cause us to incur financial penalties, subject us to potential liability and cause customers to terminate their contracts.\nCapacity constraints could disrupt access to our services, which could affect our revenue and harm our reputation.\nOur service goals of performance, reliability and availability require that we and our vendors have adequate capacity in computer systems to cope with the volume of traffic through service delivery platforms. If we are successful in growing the size and scope of our operations, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, or purchase services from vendors with sufficient capacity, to offer our customers and their subscribers enhanced services, capacity, features and functionality. This may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business rises, with no assurance that our revenue will grow. If our systems cannot be expanded in a timely manner or the requisite services purchased to cope with increased traffic we could experience disruptions in service, lower customer and subscriber satisfaction and delays in the introduction of new services. Any of these problems could impair our reputation and cause our revenue to decline.\nIf we are successful in realigning our strategic path and grow our business yet fail to manage such future growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nOur revenue from continuing operations has grown. This growth places significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we are to be able to grow effectively in the future and to manage such growth, if achieved, we must succeed in the realignment of our strategic path and improve and continue to enhance our managerial, operational and financial controls, and train and manage our employees. We must also manage new and existing relationships with customers, suppliers, business partners and other third parties. These activities will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our organization during periods of growth, our profit margins may decrease, and we may be unable to achieve our business objectives.\nOur business involves the use, transmission and storage of confidential information, and the failure to properly safeguard such information could result in significant reputational harm and monetary damages.\nOur business activities involve the use, transmission and storage of confidential information. We believe that we take commercially reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required, under existing and proposed laws, to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed. We may also be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. The unauthorized disclosure of information may result in the termination of one or more of our commercial relationships and/or a reduction in customer confidence and usage of our services, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to liability for our use or distribution of information that we receive from third parties.\nAs part of our business, we obtain content and commercial information from third parties. When we distribute this information, we may be liable for the data contained in that information. There is a risk that we may be subject to claims related to the distribution of such content such as defamation, negligence, intellectual property infringement, violation of privacy or publicity rights and product or service liability, among others. Laws or regulations of certain jurisdictions may also deem some content illegal, which may expose us to additional legal liability. We also gather personal information from subscribers in order to provide personalized services. Gathering and processing this personal information may subject us to legal liability for, among other things, defamation, negligence, invasion of privacy and product or service liability. We are also subject to laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, regarding the collection and use of subscriber information. If we do not comply with these laws and regulations, we may be exposed to legal liability. Some of the agreements by which we obtain content do not contain indemnity provisions in our favor. Even if a given contract does contain indemnity provisions, they may not cover a particular claim or type of claim or the party granting indemnity may not have the financial resources to cover the claim. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover fully the amounts or types of claims that might be made. Any liability that we incur as a result of content we receive from third parties could adversely affect our results of operations.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in mobile devices and privacy concerns related to mobile device technology could negatively affect our business.\nThe security of mobile devices and wireless networks is critical to our business. Individuals or groups may develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack mobile devices and wireless networks. Security experts have identified computer worms targeted specifically at mobile devices. Security threats could lead some mobile subscribers to reduce or delay their purchases of mobile content and applications in an attempt to protect their data privacy and reduce the security threat posed by viruses, worms and other malicious software. Wireless carriers and device manufacturers may also spend more on protecting their wireless networks and mobile devices from attack, which could delay adoption of new mobile devices that tend to include more features and functionalities that facilitate increased use of mobile data services. Actual or perceived security threats, and reactions to such threats, could reduce our revenue or require unplanned expenditures on new security initiatives.\nLawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers, which could divert management's attention and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nLawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers in the U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington at Seattle, alleging various violations of federal securities laws and of state law, including breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment, relating to alleged false and misleading statements and omissions made by us in our registration statement for our initial public offering, subsequent reports filed with the SEC and other press releases and public statements. Although some of these cases have been dismissed, the others are at an early stage and we are not able to predict the probability of the outcome or estimate of loss, if any, related to these matters. These types of litigation often are expensive and divert management's attention and resources. As a result, any of those claims, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could force us to incur significant costs.\nWe cannot be certain that our services do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Many parties in the telecommunications and software industries have begun to apply for and obtain patent protection for innovative proprietary technologies and business methods. Given that our platform interacts with various participants in the mobile data ecosystem, existing or future patents protecting certain proprietary technology and business methods may preclude us from using such proprietary technology or business methods, or may require us to pay damages for infringement or fees to obtain a license to use the proprietary technology or business methods (which may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are unacceptable), or both, which would increase our cost of doing business. In addition, litigation concerning intellectual property rights and the infringement of those rights, including patents, trademarks and copyrights, has grown significantly over the last several years and is likely to grow further in the future. If we become the subject of infringement claims, we may be forced into litigation, which will require us to devote significant resources and management's time and attention to defend against such infringement claims. If it is determined that our services infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, we may be required to pay damages or enjoined from using that technology or forced to obtain a license (which may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are unacceptable) and/or pay royalties to continue using that technology. The assertion of intellectual property infringement claims against our technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGovernment regulation of digital media is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nAs the digital media industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities becomes more likely. We believe, for example, that increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information and other mobile marketing regulations could affect our and our customers' ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information for the purpose of continued improvement of the overall mobile subscriber experience. Any regulation of the requirement to treat all content and application provider services the same over the mobile Internet, sometimes referred to as net neutrality regulation, could reduce our customers' ability to make full use of the value of our services. Further, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations to access the Internet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the mobile Internet and the viability of mobile data service providers, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize our services.\nWe have incorporated open source software into our services. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our services. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our services, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue sales of our services, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nMr. Carl C. Icahn indirectly owns a majority of our common stock and Series J preferred stock, he has a relationship with one of our directors, our certificate of incorporation waives the corporate opportunity doctrine as it relates to funds affiliated with him and he may have interests that diverge from those of other stockholders.\nFollowing the completion, and as a result of, the rights offering on March 30, 2015, entities affiliated with Mr. Carl C. Icahn, the Company\u2019s largest stockholder, became the beneficial owner, and has voting control over, of approximately 52.3% of our common stock. Entities affiliated with Mr. Icahn also own warrants to purchase an additional 9.7% of our common stock, which warrants are currently unexercisable by Mr. Icahn and such entities. Further, he holds 95.5% of our Series J preferred stock, which has limited voting rights. Mr. Icahn is able to control and exert substantial influence over us, including the election of our directors and controlling most matters requiring board or stockholder approval, including business strategies, mergers, business combinations, acquisitions or dispositions of significant assets, issuances of common stock, incurrence of debt or other financing and the payment of dividends. The existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Mr. Carl Icahn owns, controls and has an interest in many companies, some of which may compete directly or indirectly with us. As a result, his interests may not always be consistent with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders.\nIn our certificate of incorporation, we renounce and provide for a waiver of the corporate opportunity doctrine as it relates to the funds affiliated with Koala Holding LP, an affiliate of Mr. Carl C. Icahn, Technology Crossover Ventures, and any person or entity affiliated with these investors. As a result, Mr. Carl C. Icahn and entities controlled by him will have no fiduciary duty to present corporate opportunities to us. These exempted persons are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. They may also pursue, for their own accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are directed by the exempted persons to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us. As a result, corporate opportunities that may benefit us may not be available to us. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between us, Mr. Carl Icahn and his affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or our other shareholders.\nAs a result of the implementation of measures designed to protect the use of our NOLs by restricting transfers of our common stock to the extent such transfers would affect the percentage of stock that is treated as owned by a five-percent stockholder, your ability to transfer your shares of common stock and your opportunity to receive a premium on our stock may be limited.\nOn April 9, 2013, our stockholders approved a holding company reorganization in which each share of what was then Motricity common stock was exchanged for one share of Voltari common stock. As a result of this transaction, shares of our common stock are subject to transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation. In general, the transfer restrictions prohibit transfers having the effect of increasing the ownership of our common stock by (i) any person from less than 5% to 5% or more or (ii) any person owning or deemed to own 5% of more of our common stock without our consent. Consequently, your ability to transfer your shares of common stock may be limited.\nEven if our board of directors consented to a significant stock acquisition, a potential buyer might be deterred from acquiring our common stock while we still have significant tax losses being carried forward, because such an acquisition might trigger an ownership change and severely impair our ability to use our NOLs against future income. Thus, this potential tax situation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could affect adversely our shareholders' ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with a change in control. The transfer restrictions that apply to shares of our common stock, although designed as a protective measure to avoid an ownership change, may have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such a transaction may be favorable to the interests of some or all of our shareholders. This effect might prevent our stockholders from realizing an opportunity to sell all or a portion of their common stock at a premium to the prevailing market price. In addition, the transfer restrictions may delay the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our common stock and the removal of incumbent directors and management, even if such removal may be beneficial to some or all of our stockholders.\nIf we cannot meet NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, NASDAQ may delist our common stock which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We are required to meet certain qualitative and financial tests to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn May 22, 2014, we received a letter from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) advising that we did not meet the minimum $2.5 million stockholders\u2019 equity value requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market and we did not satisfy the alternative requirements for continued listing based on market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations pursuant to applicable NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. In July 2014, we submitted a plan for compliance to NASDAQ and NASDAQ notified us that we had until November 18, 2014 to implement that plan and regain compliance with the requirements for continued listing. On November 19, 2014, NASDAQ notified us that, based on our continued noncompliance with the applicable $2.5 million stockholders\u2019 equity value requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ, our securities would be subject to delisting by NASDAQ unless we timely requested a hearing before the Listing Qualifications Panel. We timely requested a hearing before the Listings Qualifications Panel, at which hearing we requested an extension of time to develop and execute a plan to regain compliance with the applicable requirements for continued listing on NASDAQ. The Listing Qualifications Panel has granted us an extension of time until May 18, 2015 to solidify a plan and to regain compliance with the minimum $2.5 million stockholders\u2019 equity value requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Our common stock will continue to trade on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cVLTC\u201d pending completion of the expiration of the extension period granted by the Listing Qualifications Panel. If we are unable to regain compliance with the $2.5 million stockholders\u2019 equity value requirement or if we otherwise fail to evidence and sustain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on NASDAQ, our common stock may be subject to delisting by NASDAQ.\nOn March 17, 2015, we received written notice from the NASDAQ notifying us that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, our common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, as required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock and the common stock will continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cVLTC.\u201d NASDAQ stated in its letter that in accordance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules, we will be provided 180 calendar days, or until September 14, 2015, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If at any time before September 14, 2015 the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the NASDAQ staff will provide us with written notification that it has achieved compliance with the minimum bid requirement. If we do not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by September 14, 2015, we may be eligible for additional time to comply with the minimum bid price requirement.\nIn order to be eligible for such additional time, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The NASDAQ Capital Market, and must notify NASDAQ in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. However, if it appears to NASDAQ that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are not otherwise eligible for additional time, the NASDAQ staff will provide us with written notification that our common stock will be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nIf we are unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, the $2.5 million stockholders\u2019 equity value requirement or if we otherwise fail to evidence and sustain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on NASDAQ, our common stock may be subject to delisting by NASDAQ. This could inhibit the ability of our common stockholders to trade their shares in the open market, thereby severely limiting the liquidity of such shares. Although stockholders may be able to trade their shares of common stock on the over-the-counter market, there can be no assurance that this would occur. Further, the over-the-counter market provides significantly less liquidity than NASDAQ and other national securities exchanges, is thinly traded and highly volatile, has fewer market makers and is not followed by analysts. As a result, your ability to trade or obtain quotations for these securities may be more limited than if they were quoted on NASDAQ or other national securities exchanges.\nOur common stock is ranked junior to our Series J preferred stock with respect to cash dividends and amounts payable in the event of our dissolution, liquidation or winding up.\nWith respect to the payment of cash dividends and amounts payable in the event our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock is ranked junior to our Series J preferred stock. This means that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding Series J preferred stock for all accrued dividends, no cash dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to our Series J preferred stockholders the liquidation preference relating to such preferred stock, plus in each case any accrued and unpaid dividends. In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our asset value would first inure to the benefit of holders of our Series J preferred stock, up to the value of the Series J preferred stock liquidation preference plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, before holders of our common stock would realize any benefits from such increase.\nWe have not paid or declared common stock cash dividends in the past, and do not plan to pay or declare common stock cash dividends in the future, and, as a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock other than the distribution of subscription rights in the rights offerings that closed in October 2012 and March 2015. We do not expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we anticipate that all of our earnings in the foreseeable future will be used in the operation and growth of our business and the payment of dividends on our Series J preferred stock. Any determination to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is currently limited by the terms of our Series J preferred stock and may be further restricted by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities. Accordingly, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. The market price for our common stock may never exceed, and may fall below, the price that you paid for such common stock.\nWe currently have fewer than 300 stockholders of record and, therefore, are eligible to terminate the registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act and, correspondingly, delist our shares from NASDAQ.\nAs a public company with fewer than 300 stockholders of record, we currently register our shares of common stock under the Exchange Act, on a voluntary basis. Section 12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act allows for the registration of any class of securities to be terminated 90 days after a company files a certification with the SEC that the number of holders of record of such class of security is fewer than 300 persons. Accordingly we are eligible to deregister our common stock under the Exchange Act. Upon the effectiveness of the termination of registration under Section 12, we would not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act, including, but not limited to, proxy statement filings and filings by insiders to disclose the acquisition and disposition of our securities. Even if we were to deregister, however, Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act would require us to continue to file annual, quarterly and current reports until no earlier than when we file our next annual report on Form 10-K. At such time, you may not have access to current information about our Company. Although we do not currently have plans to deregister, the current number of record holders of our common stock enables us to do so.\nWe expect that our revenue will fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nAny significant delays in the deployment of our services, unfavorable sales trends in our existing service categories, or changes in the spending behavior of our customers could adversely affect our revenue growth. If our revenue fluctuates or does not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price would likely decline.\nThe market price of our common stock and our common stock warrants may be highly volatile or may decline regardless of our actual operating performance.\nBroad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our common stock warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause wide fluctuations in the stock price may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\noverall conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u2022\naddition or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing or new products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\na Redemption Event occurring;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities or industry analysts that elect to follow our common stock; and\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders, including sales by our directors and officers.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Our common stock price has declined significantly since Motricity's initial public offering in 2010 and may continue to do so as a result of the above described factors as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. We are subject to this type of litigation and may be the target of additional litigation of this nature. Such securities litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, whether or not we are successful in such litigation.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these reports or analysts. If any of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our stock, or if our operating results do not meet the analysts' expectations, our stock price could decline. Moreover, if any of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish regular reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe are required by the terms of the common stock warrants to use our reasonable best efforts to maintain an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of common stock underlying the common stock warrants at the time that our warrant holders exercise their warrants. The exercise of our common stock warrants may also be limited by state securities laws. We cannot guarantee that a registration statement will be effective, in which case our warrant holders may not be able to exercise their common stock warrants.\nHolders of our common stock warrants will be able to exercise the common stock warrants only if a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), relating to the shares of our common stock underlying the warrants is then effective. We have a contractual obligation to use our reasonable best efforts to maintain a current registration statement covering the shares of common stock underlying the warrants to the extent registration at the time of exercise is required by federal securities laws, and we intend to, but may not be able to, comply with our undertaking. Our common stock warrants expire if they are not exercised in connection with certain corporate transactions, but if a registration statement covering the shares underlying the common stock warrants is not effective at the time of such transaction, you will not be able to exercise your warrants and they will expire without your being able to exercise them. Therefore, the value of the warrants may be greatly reduced if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not kept current.\nIf you do not exercise your common stock warrants, they will terminate and have no further rights or value.\nOur common stock warrants provide that they terminate if they are not exercised on or before October 11, 2017 or in connection with a capital reorganization, reclassification of our securities, consolidation or merger of our company resulting in a change of 50% of the voting power of the company, a sale of substantially all of our assets or a similar transaction requiring stockholder approval shall be effected. If you do not exercise your common stock warrants in connection with such a transaction, the warrants will terminate and be of no further value. There can be no assurance that any such transaction would provide value for the common stock received upon the exercise of the common stock warrants at or in excess of the exercise price of such warrants.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under applicable NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and, therefore, we qualify for exemptions from certain of NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements.\nFollowing the completion, and as a result of, the rights offering on March 30, 2015, entities affiliated with Mr. Carl C. Icahn, the Company\u2019s largest stockholder, became the beneficial owner of, and has voting control over, approximately 52.3% of our common stock. As a result, we are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Under these rules, we may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ Marketplace Rules regarding corporate governance, including requirements that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, that our governance and nominating committee be composed entirely of independent directors and that our compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors.", "PERMNO": 93433, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "VLTC"}
