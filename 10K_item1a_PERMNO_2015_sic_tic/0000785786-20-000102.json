{"cik": "785786", "company": "PLEXUS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nMaterial risk factors to our business and financial performance are those that may impact our strategy, which is centered around four strategic pillars: Market Focus, Superior Execution, Passion Meets Purpose and Discipline by Design . This section lays out a number of material risks that may impact those strategic pillars. Other sections of this report also include risks that may impact our strategic business objectives and affect our financial performance. The risks included herein and elsewhere in this report are not exhaustive. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of our business, new risks may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict or assess the impact of all such risks on our business.\nRisks impacting our MARKET FOCUS - We engineer innovative solutions for customers in growth markets with highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments.\nThe end markets we serve require technologically advanced products and such markets may be impacted by a number of factors that could adversely impact our customers\u2019 demand.\nFactors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve could adversely affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus. These factors include:\n\u2022customers\u2019 ability or inability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards that can result in short product life-cycles or product obsolescence,\n\u2022customers\u2019 ability or inability to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested, and\n\u2022the potential failure of our customers\u2019 products to gain widespread commercial acceptance.\nEven if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships, services offered, or to our operations, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations.\nOur customers do not make long-term commitments to us and may cancel or change their production requirements.\nWe generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand for our services. Customers also cancel, change or delay design, production or aftermarket service quantities and schedules, or fail to meet their forecasts for a number of reasons beyond our control. Customer expectations can change rapidly, requiring us to take on additional commitments or risks. In addition, customers may fail to meet their commitments to us or our expectations. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels. Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur in the future. This risk is heightened by a potential decrease in customer demand for their products or our services as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers\u2019 demand, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital (including inventory) management, facility and capacity requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements. The short-term nature of our customers\u2019 commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products affect our ability to accurately estimate their future requirements. Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results. The need for us to correctly anticipate component needs is amplified in times of shortages. The current environment of tight component supply, which might be further impacted by global pandemic-related interruptions, can increase the difficulties and cost of anticipating changing demand. Moreover, because our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.\nRapid increases in customer demand may stress personnel and other capacity resources. We may not have sufficient resources, including personnel and components, at any given time to meet all of our customers\u2019 demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program, which could result in a loss of business from such customers.\nThe majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose a major customer or program or if there are challenges in those market sectors, then our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.\nNet sales to our 10 largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods. Our 10 largest customers accounted for 55.2% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020, and 54.6% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019. During each of these periods there was one customer that represented 10.0% or more of our net sales.\nOur major customers may vary from period to period, and our major customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile or temporary nature of certain programs. In any given period, a higher portion of our sales may be concentrated with customers or projects with relatively lower margins, which could adversely affect our results. We have experienced from time to time, and in the future may experience, significant disengagements with customers or of programs, adverse changes in customer supply chain strategies and the end of life of significant programs. Especially given our discrete number of customers, the loss of, or significant reductions in net sales to any of our major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors, as identified in Part I, Item 1, herein. Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions, as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific. Any weakness in our customers\u2019 end markets could affect our business and results of operations. Economic, business or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or our failure to choose to do business in appropriate sectors, can particularly impact Plexus. For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the U.S. healthcare sector, generally. In addition, the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is affected by global health pandemics, such as COVID-19, which has created both opportunities and challenges for the Company. For example, the pandemic caused an increase in sales specific to products supporting pandemic relief efforts and critical care products while weakening sales related to elective procedures or other non-critical care products. Similarly, commercial aerospace was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions on airline travel, resulting in decreased demand from our commercial aerospace customers. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has historically been subject to significant cyclicality and volatility. Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect opportunities in all of our market sectors.\nWe rely on timely and regular payments from our customers, and the inability or failure of our major customers to meet their obligations to us or their bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also have receivables factoring agreements in place; therefore, deterioration in the payment experience with or credit quality of our major customers, or issues with the banking counterparties to our factoring agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to our inability to factor such receivables.\nFrom time to time, our customers, including former major customers, have been affected by merger, acquisition, divestiture and spin-off activity. While these transactions may present us with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially reduce their purchases or completely disengage from us as a result of transitioning such business to our competitors or their internal operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations, industry standards, and other stakeholder expectations; a failure to comply with current and future regulations, standards and expectations could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, industry standards (as well as customer-specific standards), and other stakeholder expectations relating to the products we design, manufacture and service as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations. The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory enforcement activity has increased in recent periods. A failure to comply with such laws, regulations or standards can result in, among other consequences, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, total or partial suspension of production, including debarment, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations. Further, customer, investor, and employee expectations in areas such as environmental, social matters and corporate governance (ESG) have been rapidly evolving and increasing. The enhanced stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to Plexus requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving standards and expectations and the associated reporting\nrequirements. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers and an inability to attract and retain top talent.\nOur Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration regulations and similar regulations in other countries. We also design, manufacture and service products for certain industries, including certain applications where the U.S. government is the end customer, that face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, as well as standards of quality systems, technologies or markets.\nThe regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services. For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of healthcare providers, and changes in how healthcare in the U.S. is structured, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector as well as impact our margins.\nOur customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above. Our customers\u2019 failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them. In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs we have in place for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.\nIncreased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.\nOur industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis. In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing, manufacturing and servicing products internally and may choose to design, manufacture or service products (including products or product types that we currently design, manufacture or service for them) themselves rather than outsource such activities. Consolidations and other changes in our industry may result in a changing competitive landscape.\nOur competitors may:\n\u2022respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies\n\u2022have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic and market presence\n\u2022be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities\n\u2022adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements\n\u2022have lower internal cost structures\n\u2022have greater direct buying power with component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers\n\u2022devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services and execution of their strategy, and\n\u2022be better positioned to compete on price for their services.\nOur manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or otherwise become increasingly competitive. Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.\nWe may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions or strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired operations or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWhile we have primarily chosen an organic growth strategy in recent years, if we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions, including the acquisition of operations divested by our customers, or similar transactions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. These include operating risks such as the inability to successfully integrate businesses, systems and personnel, impacts on customer programs and relationships; and an inability to realize anticipated synergies or economies of scale. They also include financial risks such as the use of cash or incurrence of additional debt and interest expense, the potential volatility or weakness in our stock price as a result of the announcement of such transactions, the incurrence of large write-offs or write-downs, and other potential financial impacts.\nRisks impacting our SUPERIOR EXECUTION - We are dedicated partners to our customers, committed to achieving zero defects and perfect delivery through operational excellence.\nWe have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage or execute on that model could adversely affect our operations, financial results and reputation.\nOur business model focuses on products and services that are highly complex and subject to demanding regulatory requirements. Our customers\u2019 products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility necessitating optimized manufacturing and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform. The products we design, manufacture, and service are also typically complex, heavily regulated, and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers. In addition, we offer Aftermarket Services to our customers, which add to the complexity of our business model.\nOur business model requires a great degree of attention, flexibility and resources. These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations and geographies. We also depend on securing and ramping new customers and programs and on transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for companies that did not previously outsource such activities.\nThe complexity of our service model, which encompasses a broad range of services in the product realization process including Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing and Aftermarket Services, often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations and unique customer requirements. In addition, program complexity and associated customer expectations have increased in recent years with respect to certain capabilities, commitments, allocation of risk and compliance with third party standards, requiring extraordinary measures to ensure operational execution and compliance within unique, non-standard engagements. If we fail to meet those obligations, or are otherwise unable to execute on our commitments or unsuccessfully mitigate such risks, then it could result in claims against us, regulatory violations, or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts. A failure to adequately understand unique customer requirements may also impact our ability to estimate and ultimately recover associated costs, adversely affecting our financial results.\nMany of the markets for our manufacturing, engineering, aftermarket and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments. Our internal processes are also subject to these factors. The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:\n\u2022retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel, and attract additional qualified personnel, especially in times of tight labor markets\n\u2022choose, maintain, and enhance appropriate technological and service capabilities\n\u2022successfully manage the implementation and execution of information systems\n\u2022develop and market services that meet changing customer needs\n\u2022effectively execute our services and perform to our customers\u2019 expectations, and\n\u2022successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nAlthough we believe that our operations utilize the technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our technical personnel, equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, we may have to acquire new skills, technologies and equipment to remain competitive, as well as offer new or additional services, all of which may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results. Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers\u2019 changing technological needs and requirements, or to perform to their expectations or standards, as well as our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThere may be problems with the products we design, manufacture or service that could result in liability claims against us, reduced demand for our services and damage to our reputation.\nWe design, manufacture and service products to our customers\u2019 specifications, many of which are highly complex, for industries, such as healthcare, aerospace and defense, that have higher risk profiles. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design, manufacturing or servicing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues. Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes, servicing, or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished. In addition, such problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible. These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product or injury to person or property.\nEven if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us. While we seek to secure contractual protection and/or to insure against many of these risks, we may not have practical recourse against certain suppliers, and contractual protections, insurance coverage or supplier warranties, as well as our other risk mitigation efforts, may be inadequate, not cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues. We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could adversely affect our business relationships.\nWe experience raw material and component shortages, price fluctuations, and supplier quality concerns.\nWe generally do not have long-term supply agreements. We experience, and in the future will likely continue to experience, raw material and component shortages due to supplier capacity constraints, or their failure to deliver. We also experience increased lead times to procure certain types of components from time to time, including during fiscal 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and other factors. Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, tariffs, trade wars, trade disputes and trade protection measures, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession, increased demand due to economic growth, preferential allocations and other localized events. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component. Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all. Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods. Additionally, a delay in obtaining a particular component may result in other components for the related project being held for longer periods of time, increasing working capital and risking inventory obsolescence. An inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis or successfully execute on our business continuity processes, could also harm relationships with our customers.\nIn addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria. Certain materials provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others. The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations. The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims. Further, the commitments made to us by our suppliers, and the terms applicable to such relationships, may not match all the commitments we make to, and the terms of our arrangements with, our customers, and such variations may lead us to incur additional expense or liability and/or cause other disruptions to our business.\nRaw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries, along with other factors such as tariffs and trade disputes, can also result in increased pricing. While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past. Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur services involve other inventory risk.\nMost of our services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts or orders. Although, in general, our commercial contracts with our customers obligate\nour customers to ultimately purchase inventory ordered to support their forecasts or orders, Plexus generally finances these purchases initially. In addition, suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements. A customer\u2019s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us. Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components. While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory, require customers to reimburse us for these items and/or price our services to address related risks, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or in full, be able to collect on these obligations or adequately reflect such risks in our pricing. In addition to increasing inventory in certain instances to support new program ramps, we may also increase inventory if we experience component shortages or longer lead times for certain components in order to maintain a high level of customer service. In such situations, we may procure components earlier, which has led to an increase in inventory in the short term and may lead to increased, excess, or obsolete inventory in the future. Excess or obsolete inventory, the need to acquire increasing amounts of inventory due to shortages, customer demand or otherwise, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.\nIn addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories. These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers. In addition, our inventory may be held at a customer\u2019s facility or warehouse, or elsewhere in a location outside of our control, which may increase the risk of loss. Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to customers\u2019 credit risks as well as the risk of potential customer default and the need to enforce those obligations.\nAn inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nAs a global company with a complex business model, we are heavily dependent on our information systems to support our customers\u2019 requirements and to successfully manage our business. Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, cybersecurity, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees. Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, cyber threats, industrial espionage (internal or external), hacking, break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures. Due to the intellectual property we maintain on our systems related to high technology components, sub-components, manufacturing processes, and our customers\u2019 products, we are a likely target from various external and internal cyber threats, such as lone attackers, competitors, our customers\u2019 competitors, and nation states seeking to gain access to such intellectual property, as well as both unintentional and malicious internal threats. In addition, lone and organized crime elements have been known to extort money by encrypting their victims\u2019 data (ransomware) and utilize their victims\u2019 resources for unauthorized mining of cryptocurrency.\nThe increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate the threat landscape and new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. There can be no assurance that the security measures and systems configurations we choose to implement will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. Any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, fines and penalties, negative reactions from current and potential future customers, and reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Also, the time and funds spent on monitoring and mitigating our exposure and responding to breaches, including the training of employees, the purchase of protective technologies and the hiring of additional employees and consultants to assist in these efforts could adversely affect our financial results. This risk is enhanced as a result of the number of employees currently working remotely due to the global pandemic, for example by reason of utilizing home networks that may lack encryption or secure password protection, virtual meeting/conference security concerns and increase of phishing/cyber-attacks around COVID-19 digital resources.\nMoreover, we are subject to increasing expectations and data security requirements from our customers, including those related to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, and Cybersecurity Maturity Model\nCertification. Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of our or our customers\u2019 financial, product or other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory or other legal actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) and similar legislation in jurisdictions in which we operate impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws and regulations can be costly. Failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, fines and penalties, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nPlexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.\nWe have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate represent a majority of our net sales and operating income, with a particular concentration in Malaysia. In addition, although we have repatriated a substantial amount of cash since the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d), a significant amount of our cash balances remain held outside of the U.S., with a particular concentration in Malaysia and China. We purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries. These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:\n\u2022economic, political or civil instability\n\u2022transportation delays or interruptions\n\u2022exchange rate fluctuations\n\u2022potential disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access cash amounts held outside of the U.S.\n\u2022changes in labor markets, such as government-mandated wage increases, increases to minimum wage requirements, changes in union-related laws and regulations, limitations on immigration or the free movement of labor or restrictions on the use of migrant workers, and difficulties in appropriately staffing and managing personnel in diverse cultures\n\u2022compliance with laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, applicable to companies with global operations\n\u2022changes in the taxation of earnings both in the U.S. and in other countries\n\u2022reputational risks related to, among other factors, varying standards and practices among countries\n\u2022changes in duty rates\n\u2022significant natural disasters and other events or factors impacting local infrastructure\n\u2022the impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d)\n\u2022the effects of other international political developments, such as tariffs, embargoes, sanctions, boycotts, trade wars, energy disruptions, trade agreements and changes in trade policies, including those which may be effected by the U.S. and other countries\u2019 political reactions to those actions, and\n\u2022regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements.\nAs our international operations continue to expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, developments affecting particular countries can adversely affect our ability to access cash or other assets held in such countries.\nA significant portion of our operations currently occurs in the APAC region, particularly in Malaysia. The concentration of our operations, assets and profitability in that region exposes us to adverse developments, economic, political or otherwise, in those countries.\nChanges in policies by or changes in elected officials of the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to trade wars, changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the \"USMCA\"), negotiated by Canada, Mexico and the U.S. to update and replace the North America Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), became effective July 1, 2020. The USMCA is similar to NAFTA; however, it contains several new compliance obligations addressing such issues as rules of origin, labor standard, certificate of origin documentation and de minimis thresholds, as well as new policies on labor and environmental standards, intellectual property protections and some digital trade provisions. While certain aspects of the USMCA may be\npositive, others, including potentially higher regulatory compliance costs, may have a negative impact on our business and adversely affect our operations in Mexico. Also, our current facilities in Mexico operate under the Mexican Maquiladora (\u201cIMMEX\u201d) program. This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations. We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements. Additionally, increasing tariffs and other trade protection measures between the U.S. and China may affect the cost of our products originating in China as well as the demand for our products manufactured in China in the event our customers reduce operations in China as a result of such tariffs or trade protection measures. These actions could also affect the cost and/or availability of components that we procure from suppliers in China. Government-imposed restrictions on where we can produce certain types of products or source components, such as the potential ratification of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, could limit our ability to manufacture products in, or source components from, certain geographies, thereby negatively affecting cost and profitability by having to shift such production or the sourcing of components to the U.S. or other higher-cost locations.\nThe United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally left the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) on January 31, 2020 and entered into a transition period that is expected to conclude on December 31, 2020 during which the UK and the EU are seeking to establish the terms of their future relationship. This exit has resulted in currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility. The final terms of Brexit are not yet known as negotiations continue between the UK and the EU. Given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit, or how such implications might affect us (as we also have operations in Scotland), remain unclear at this time. Brexit could, among other impacts, disrupt trade and the movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the EU or other countries, disrupt the stability of the EU generally, and lead to a downturn in consumer sentiment. This could result in overall negative economic growth, as well as create legal, political, regulatory and global economic uncertainty. These and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nA failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third-party certification requirements or standards, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own or third-party quality standards, commercial terms, social responsibility standards, or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies and/or terms with our suppliers, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations.\nOur compliance with these heightened and/or additional policies, standards and third-party certification requirements, and managing a supply chain in accordance therewith, could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices. In certain circumstances, to meet the requirements or standards of our customers we may be obligated to select certain suppliers or make other sourcing choices, and we may bear responsibility for adverse outcomes even if these matters are as the result of third-party actions or outside of our control.\nIntellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.\nAlthough our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, our services may and the products offered by our customers do involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties. In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, then we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims. In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.\nAdditionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies. Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products, and could affect our\ncustomer relationships more broadly. Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.\nNatural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.\nSome of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods. All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to weather events or global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, workplace violence and failures of utilities. If such an event was to occur and we did not have an effective business continuity plan in place, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event, with the impact of the event potentially magnified in areas where we have multiple facilities in close proximity. For example, we maintain significant production capacity in Penang, Malaysia, and an isolated event in that geography could materially hinder our production capabilities. Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure.\nIn addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack. If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays. Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and potentially have a negative affect our relationships and financial results.\nAlthough we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets. If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen, damaged or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers\u2019 data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.\nRisks impacting our PASSION MEETS PURPOSE - We are united as a team. We are guided by our values and leadership behaviors. We do the right thing to support our team members, communities and customers.\nWe depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire, develop and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued services of our key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, particularly those to fill key leadership positions and the highly skilled technical personnel involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of products. The competition for these individuals is significant, especially in tight labor markets, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.\nFrom time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, promotions, transitions, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees, including those that are unexpected. Transitions or other changes in responsibilities among officers and key employees without having identified and ready successors for such these critical roles, particularly when such changes are unanticipated, unplanned or not executed effectively, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, as well as harm our reputation, which could have an effect on our results. Further, as we grow in size and complexity, a failure to continuously focus on the development of personnel and plan for the succession of critical roles may result in shortfalls in the talent required to execute effectively and affect our operations and financial results.\nWe also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally. Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of union organizing activities, work actions, tightening labor markets or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.\nIn addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient qualified personnel to conduct those operations. If we fail to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently our financial results, could be adversely affected. In new or existing facilities, we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing healthcare costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees, restrictions on immigration, labor mobility, as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results. Our adoption of certain third-party health, safety and other employment-related regulatory standards could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.\nRisks impacting our DISCIPLINE BY DESIGN - We hold ourselves accountable to delivering shareholder value through consistent application of a disciplined financial model.\nChallenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, the provision of new services, or start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs could affect our operations and financial results.\nOur engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new programs or types of services for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities. We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program or service, including evaluating whether the customer, program or service fits with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success. If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the strategic nature of the customer, anticipated costs, risks and rewards. The failure to make prudent engagement decisions or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.\nAlso, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of anticipated revenue from a new program or service; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period. Some new programs or services require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies. We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product or services on a timely basis. Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals or economic conditions. The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program\u2019s or service\u2019s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn recent years, ramping new programs has been a key contributor to our revenue growth. The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities and geographies, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital. These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new programs, which typically lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages. We typically manage multiple new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes.\nThe effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations and geographies. We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures. We may also be required to transfer projects between facilities due to tariffs and other trade measures impacting particular countries such as China. Although we try to recover costs from our customers and minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between our facilities and geographies, we may not be successful and there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.\nWhile these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.\nFailure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.\nOur industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet changing customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction\ndecisions effectively, as well as fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these decisions, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer. Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to new or other facilities or due to acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. For example, we recently announced our intent to expand our geographic locations and construct a new manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand, to supplement our footprint the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate. If we are unable to effectively manage this or other expansions or consolidations, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected. Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include:\n\u2022the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value\n\u2022challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs\n\u2022incurrence of restructuring costs or other charges that may be insufficient or may not have their intended effects\n\u2022additional fixed or other costs, or selling and administrative expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by new business\n\u2022a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities, as well as the increased costs associated with opening new facilities\n\u2022difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans\n\u2022diversion of management's attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions\n\u2022strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources, and\n\u2022inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.\nPeriods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges. We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results. When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring costs.\nIn addition, to meet our customers' needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products are site-specific, to achieve increased efficiencies, or to address factors affecting specific locations, such as tariffs and trade disputes, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another. Since customers\u2019 needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location. We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.\nChanges in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results.\nOur effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in tax laws or tax rates in those jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions by the U.S. (including additional guidance and interpretations related to U.S. Tax Reform) or other countries or Brexit, could continue to have a material impact on our operating results. Among other things, we have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by the global intangible low-taxed income provisions added by U.S. Tax Reform and related new tax legislation, interpretations and guidance. Our effective tax rate may also be impacted by tax holidays and other various tax credits granted by local taxing authorities. In addition, the implementation of U.S. Tax Reform has required the use of estimates, which may be refined in future periods. All incentives, including a tax holiday granted to our Malaysian subsidiary, are subject to certain terms and conditions. While we expect to comply with these conditions, we would experience adverse tax consequences if we are found to not be in compliance or if the terms and conditions of the tax holiday are unfavorably altered by the local taxing authorities.\nOur taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon the local taxing authority\u2019s acceptance of our operational and intercompany transfer pricing practices as being at \u201carm\u2019s length.\u201d Due to inconsistencies among jurisdictions in the application of the arm\u2019s length standard, our transfer pricing methods may be challenged and, if not upheld, could increase our income tax expense. Risks associated with transfer pricing adjustments are further highlighted by the global initiative from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development called the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u2019) project. The BEPS project is challenging longstanding international tax norms regarding the taxation of profits from cross-border business. Given the scope of our international operations and the fluid and uncertain nature of how the BEPS project might ultimately lead to future legislation, it is difficult to assess how any changes in tax laws would impact our income tax expense.\nWe review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income by jurisdiction. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in each of our jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.\nWe may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing or capital.\nAlthough we have credit facilities, we cannot be certain that our existing credit arrangements will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations and/or increased working capital needs. In addition, if we do not comply with the covenants under our credit agreement, our ability to borrow under that facility would be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and receivables factoring programs, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise, which could, among other impacts, increase the duration of our cash collection cycle. While we currently believe we have ample liquidity to manage the financial impact of COVID-19, we can give no assurance that this will continue to be the case if the impact of COVID-19 is prolonged or if there is an extended impact on us or the economy in general.\nOur future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives. During fiscal 2020, we successfully refinanced our credit facility to, among other changes, secure a 364 day delayed draw term loans for $138 million, in addition to the revolving credit facility of $350 million. After maturity of the term loans on April 28, 2021, we also have the potential to increase capacity under our revolving credit facility from $350 million to $600 million with the approval of the lenders. In addition, we also have receivables factoring programs. Many of our borrowings are at variable interest rates and therefore our interest expense is subject to increase if rates, including the London Interbank Offering Rate (\"LIBOR\"), increase.\nWe may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new facilities, or through a combination of these methods. We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms. If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders\u2019 ownership interests; we may not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price. Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.\nThe elimination of LIBOR could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nBorrowings under our credit facilities use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. The UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness causing a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Specifically, the use of an alternative reference rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense on our borrowings, and increased borrowing costs in the future. Management continues to evaluate the LIBOR exposure risks.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new medical and other information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions by governmental entities or others to contain it or treat its impact.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak poses the risk that we or our employees, suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee\nhealth and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be prudent or required by governmental authorities. For example, in China, at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in that country during our second quarter of fiscal 2020, our operations were impacted for several weeks due to quarantines, travel restrictions, and other factors affecting us and our suppliers. In addition, we experienced a temporary reduction of our operating capacity in Malaysia during our second quarter of fiscal 2020 as a result of government-mandated actions to control the spread of COVID-19. Finally, while our facilities, and those of some of our suppliers, have been classified as essential or otherwise permitted to operate in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated, we can give no assurance that this will not change in the future or that we or our suppliers will continue to be permitted to conduct business in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nAdditionally, we have modified our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees. We may take further actions, or be required to take further actions, that are in the best interests of our employees. Our suppliers and customers have also implemented such measures, which has resulted in, and we expect it will continue to result in, disruptions or delays and higher costs. The implementation of health and safety practices by us, our suppliers, or our customers could impact customer demand, supplier deliveries, our productivity, and costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWhile we currently believe we have ample liquidity to manage the financial impact of COVID-19, we can give no assurance that this will continue to be the case if the impact of COVID-19 is prolonged or if there is an extended impact on us or the economy generally. Further, the impacts of COVID-19 have caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. If our liquidity or access to capital becomes significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increase significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as result of volatility in the capital markets, a reduction in our creditworthiness or other factors, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward existing or new initiatives or investments, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition.\nChanges to financial accounting rules or standards, or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators, may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. For example, new FASB guidance that impacts revenue recognition criteria was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which resulted in costs of compliance for additional processes, systems and enhanced controls. A change in these principles or the interpretation or implementation of them may have a significant effect on our reported results, forecasted financial results or the way we conduct business.", "PERMNO": 10032, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "PLXS"}
