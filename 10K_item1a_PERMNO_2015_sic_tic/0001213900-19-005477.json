{"cik": "1641398", "company": "TMSR HOLDING Co Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our shares of common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before you decide to buy any shares. Any of the following risks could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer materially, causing the market price of our shares of common stock to decline, in which event you may lose part or all of your investment in our shares of common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not deem material may also become important factors that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur revenues are highly dependent on a small number of customers, and we will likely continue to be dependent on a small number of customers.\nTwo of Company\u2019s customers, Wuhan Zhirong and Panzhihua Jingsheng, accounted for 34.3% and 22.0%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Since these two customers are Hubei Shengrong\u2019s, we will be substantially dependent on revenues generated by our other smaller customers through our sales efforts starting from the beginning of 2019. Therefore, we are, and will likely continue to be, dependent on a small number of customers, and the loss of any such customer would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, as a result of our reliance on a limited number of customers, we could face pricing and other competitive pressures which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA significant part of Jiangsu Ronghai\u2019s revenues is also derived from a small number of customers. Jiangsu Ronghai expects a small number of customers will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. From 2009 to December 2018, Nantong Linan Industrial Trading Co. Ltd. accounts for 50% of the company's total sales. The loss of Nantong Linan, or the change of the contractual terms of the contract entered between Jiangsu Ronghai and Nantong Linan or any significant dispute with Nantong Linan could materially adversely affect its financial condition and its results of operations.\nIf one or more of Jiangsu Ronghai\u2019s customers does not perform under one or more contracts with it and Jiangsu Ronghai is not able to find a replacement contract, or if a customer exercises certain rights to terminate the contract, Jiangsu Ronghai could suffer a loss of revenues that could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company is unable to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis, the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its ability to successfully obtain timely payment from its customers, especially its two major customers, namely Wuhan Zhirong and Panzhihua Jingsheng, of the amounts they owe. Even though we have disposed Hubei Shengrong, so did the accounts receivable balance of Hubei Shengrong. In the past, our major customers had records of failing to make full payment on time. The Company maintains allowances against its receivables that it believes are adequate to reserve for potentially uncollectible amounts. However, actual losses on customer balances could differ from those that the Company currently anticipates and, as a result, it may need to adjust its allowances. In addition, there is no guarantee that the Company will accurately assess the creditworthiness of its customers. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for its customers, and as a result could cause them to delay payments, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase the Company\u2019s receivables balance, or not pay their obligations to the Company. Timely collection of customers\u2019 balances also depends on the company\u2019s ability to complete its contractual commitments and bill and collect its invoiced revenues. If the Company is unable to meet its contractual commitments, it might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect its customer balances, and if this occurs, its results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nFuture bad debt losses may exceed the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nThe Company has established an allowance for possible losses expected in connection with its account receivables. In establishing the allowance for such losses, the Company considered historical experiences, the microeconomic environment, trends in the construction, decorative and paint materials industry, expected collectability of amounts receivable that were past due, and the expected collectability of overdue receivable.\nThe determination of the amount of allowance for account receivable is subjective; although the method for determining the amount of the allowance uses criteria such as the microeconomic environment and historical experiences. Given the Company customers\u2019 past repayment performances, specifically Wuhan KYX and Wuhan Zhirong, these criteria may not be adequate predictors of whether the payments of The Company\u2019s account receivable will be fully returned per credit terms. Accordingly, the Company cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur. If the allowance proves to be inadequate, the Company will need to make additional provisions to the allowance, which is accounted for as charges to income, which would adversely impact results of operations and financial condition. Any increase in the allowance could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating subsidiaries, Shengrong WFOE, Wuhan Host and Jiangsu Ronghai all have limited operating histories, which make it difficult to evaluate their businesses and prospects.\nShengrong WFOE commenced operations in March 2016 and has a limited operating history. Prior to the year end of 2018, the Company had limited operations and was focused primarily on research and development. Shengrong WFOE did not generate any sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, but entered into several sales agreements with new customers.\nWe may not be able to achieve similar results or grow at the same rate as Hubei Shengrong has in the past. It is also difficult to our prospects, as we may not have sufficient experience in addressing the risks to which companies operating in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the industrial and mining recycling industry may be exposed. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar stage of development frequently experience, including the potential failure to:\n\u25cf obtain sufficient working capital and increase its registered capital to support expansion of our industrial and mining recycling business;\n\u25cf comply with any changes in the laws and regulations of the PRC or local province that may affect our operations;\n\u25cf expand our customer base;\n\u25cf maintain adequate control of default risks and expenses allowing us to realize anticipated revenue growth;\n\u25cf implement our growth strategies and plans and adapt and modify them as needed;\n\u25cf integrate any future business combinations; and\n\u25cf anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the Chinese industrial and mining recycling industry resulting from changes in government regulations, mergers and Business Combinations involving our competitors, and other significant competitive and market dynamics.\nIf we are unable to address any or all of the foregoing risks, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nSimilarly, Jiangsu Ronghai started operation in May 2009 and also have a limited operations history. While Jiangsu Ronghai generated $18.31 million in revenue in 2017 and $17.47 million in revenue in 2018, respectively. But the growth rate in history cannot be indicative of future performance. Accordingly, you should consider our future prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties experienced by early stage companies in evolving industries such as the coal products and alternative energy industries in China. Jiangsu Ronghai\u2019s limited history for selling steam coal may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations. Our operations are subject to all of the risks, challenges, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the operation of any new business, as well as those risks that are specific to the coal trading industry. Investors should evaluate us in light of the problems and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies attempting to develop markets for new products and technologies. Despite our best efforts, we may never overcome these obstacles.\nChanges policies and regulations, as well as local environmental requirements on exploiting and using coal or its products, are likely to have an impact on the coal market, which will affect the company's earnings.\nShengrong WFOE is dependent on Hubei Shengrong as one of its major supplier. If we can\u2019t find other supplier to replace Hubei Shengrong, we could encounter supply shortages and/or incur higher costs.\nIn December 2018, Hubei Shengrong was disposed by the Company. According to the planning requirements of local government in 2018, manufacture enterprises were requested to move away from the city center. Therefore, Hubei Shengrong has to close the existing plant, relocate and build a new plant, which is expected to take 7-8 years; and in the meantime, Hubei Shengrong may not be able to have normal production.\nCurrently, Shengrong WFOE sells recycling machinery products manufactured by Hubei Shengrong. We currently don\u2019t know when Hubei Shengrong starts to move and stop production. We may not find new suppliers to provide qualified recycling machinery products to meet our clients demand in time.\nAlthough we believe that alternative supply sources are available, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to identify or negotiate with such sources on terms that are commercially reasonable. If Hubei Shengrong is unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts or we are unable to identify alternative sources, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompetition in the industrial and mining recycling industry is likely to grow and could cause us to lose market share and revenues in the future.\nWe believes that the industrial and mining recycling industry is an emerging market in China. we may face growing competition in the industrial and mining recycling industry, and We believe that the industrial and mining recycling industry is expected to become more competitive as this industry matures and begins to consolidate. We will compete with several companies in the purification and recycling of industrial waste residue by the permanent magnet device and technology. Some of these competitors will likely have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. As a result, we could lose market share and its revenues could decline, thereby adversely affecting our earnings and potential for growth. While we believe that it will be able to successfully compete in this area as a result of its proprietary technology, there is no assurance that it will be able to hire and retain the necessary employees and compete successfully.\nAs the government starts to impose stricter policies on Environmental Protection, the mining recycling market gets bigger. The competition could become increasingly fierce in the near future. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s technology has been industrialized which is relatively mature, which is a not pure brand new technology.\nOur solid waste recycling systems business requires highly qualified personnel, and if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, then it may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur business\u2019 success depends upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Expansion of our solid waste recycling systems business may require additional managers and employees with relevant industry experience, and its success will be highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and other employees. We may not be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. In addition, competition for skilled personnel is significant in China. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified managers and employees. We may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain qualified replacements and its businesses may be disrupted and its financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, key managers may join a competitor or form a competing company. An operating company may not be able to successfully enforce any contractual rights with its management team, in particular in China, where all of these individuals reside.\nDiscontinuation of preferential tax treatment our PRC subsidiaries currently enjoys may result in additional compliance obligations and costs so as to materially and adversely impact the company\u2019s net income.\nFrom 2013 through 2016, local tax authorities granted Hubei Shengrong the preferential income tax rate of 15% because Hubei Shengrong was entitled to the preferential rate as a \u201chigh-tech enterprise.\u201d The discontinuation of such preferential tax treatment may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In December 2016, local tax authorities renewed Hubei\u2019s preferential tax treatment through 2019. Wuhan Host also entitles to the preferential tax treatment through 2019. During the effective period of high-tech enterprise certificate held by Hubei Shengrong and Wuhan Host, there won\u2019t be any risk that the treatment could be revoked, unless they choose to liquate or dissolve or related laws and regulated be modified or invalid by government authorities. Shengrong WFOE and its subsidiary, Jiangsu Rong Hai, none of which acquired or will be able to be recognized as high-tech company in recent years and the enterprise income tax rate applied to these companies are 25%. But, since the patents, which are unique and advanced in China, owned by Hubei Shengrong is in the process of the transfer to Shengrong WFOE, Shengrong WFOE has faith in being recognized as a high-tech enterprise and should be able to renew the certificate in future.\nIf Shengrong WFOE and Wuhan Host fail to retain certain of their key personnel and attract and retain additional qualified personnel, neither Shengrong WFOE nor Wuhan Host might be able to remain competitive, continue to expand its technology or pursue growth.\nShengrong WFOE\u2019s future success depends upon the continued service of certain of its executive officers and other key research and development personnel, such as Ms. Jianzhen Li and Mr. Xiaonian Zhang who possess longstanding industry relationships and technical knowledge of Shengrong WFOE\u2019s products and operations. Although we believe that our relationship with these individuals is positive, there can be no assurance that the services of these individuals will continue to be available to us in the future. There can be no assurance that these persons will agree to continue to be employed by us after the expiration dates of their current contracts.\nSimilarly, Wuhan Host\u2019s success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, administrative, manufacturing, sales, and research and development personnel. Due to the specialized nature of its business, it may be difficult to locate and hire qualified personnel. The loss of services of one of its executive officers or other key personnel, or failure to attract and retain other executive officers or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Although Wuhan Host has been successful in planning for and retaining highly capable and qualified successor management in the past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the full amount of synergies that are anticipated, or achieve the synergies on the schedule anticipated, from the acquisitions of both Wuhan Host and Jiangsu Rong Hai.\nAlthough The Company currently expect to achieve synergies from the Wuhan HOST acquisition of approximately $7.0 million during fiscal 2018, the inclusion of these expected synergy targets should not be viewed as a representation that The Company will in fact achieve these synergies by the end of fiscal 2018, or at all. To the extent the Company fails to achieve these synergies, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be impacted, and any such impact may be material.\nThe Company has identified various synergies including corporate and division overhead savings, brand enhancement, vendor funds, marketing and advertising cost reduction and operational efficiencies. Actual synergies, the expenses and cash required to realize the synergies and the sources of the synergies could differ materially from these estimates, and the Company cannot assure you that it will achieve the full amount of synergies on the schedule anticipated, or at all, or that these synergy programs will not have other adverse effects on our business. In light of these significant uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on the Company\u2019s estimated synergies.\nFailure to manage Wuhan HOST and Jiangsu Ronghai effectively since its acquisition could materially impact our business.\nThe Company has recently experienced a period of rapid growth in its operations. In particular, it has significantly increased the size of its customer base due to the acquisition of both Wuhan HOST and Jiangsu Ronghai. The Company anticipates that it will continue to significantly expand its operations and headcount in the near term. However, recent growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on the Company\u2019s management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. The Company\u2019s success will depend in part on its ability to manage both entities effectively. To manage the recent and expected growth of its operations and personnel, The Company will need to continue to improve its operational, financial and management controls and its reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage Wuhan HOST and Jiangsu Rong Hai could result in difficulty or delays in deploying the Company\u2019s services to customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business performance and results of operations.\nWuhan Host expects to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future and may require additional capital to support its business growth. This capital might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nIn the expansion of Wuhan Host's business, the company may need external financing. If the debt capital ratio and equity capital ratio cannot be reasonably arranged, the comprehensive capital cost of the company will rise sharply, resulting in the shrinking of the company's value, and the company may be seriously insolvent.\nWuhan Host particularly expects to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in connection with the following:\n\u25cf expansion of sales and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf expansion of manufacturing capacity;\n\u25cf funding research, development and clinical activities related to our existing products and product platform;\n\u25cf funding research, development and clinical activities related to new products;\n\u25cf pursuing and maintaining appropriate regulatory clearances and approvals for our existing products and any new products that we may develop; and\n\u25cf preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, and maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and position.\nIn addition, Wuhan Host general and administrative expense may continue to increase due to the additional operational and reporting costs associated with our expanded operations and being a public company.\nWuhan Host anticipates that its principal sources of funds in the future will be revenue generated from the sale of its products. Wuhan Host will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and maintain profitability, and even if it achieves profitability, it cannot be sure that it will remain profitable for any substantial period of time. Its failure to become and remain profitable could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts or continue to fund our operations.\nIt is also possible that Wuhan Host may allocate significant amounts of capital toward products, technologies or geographies for which market demand is lower than anticipated and, as a result, Wuhan Host may subsequently abandon such efforts. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, or if we expend capital on projects that are not successful, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and we may even be required to scale back our operations.\nResidential and non-residential construction activity is cyclical and influenced by many factors, and any reduction in the activity in one or both of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the business of Wuhan Host.\nThe results of operations of Wuhan Host can vary materially in response to market conditions and changes in the demand for its products. Historically, demand for Wuhan\u2019s products has been closely tied to residential construction, non-residential construction, and infrastructure activity in PRC, particularly Hubei province. Wuhan Host\u2019s success and future growth prospects depend, to a significant extent, on conditions in these markets and the degree to which these markets are strong in the future.\nThe Chinese construction industry and related markets are cyclical and have in the past been, and may in the future be, materially and adversely affected by general economic and global financial market conditions. These factors impact not only Wuhan Host\u2019s business, but those of its customers and suppliers as well. This influence is true with respect to macroeconomic factors within PRC.\nThe markets in the construction industry in which Wuhan Host operates are also subject to other more specific factors. Residential construction activity levels are influenced by and sensitive to a number of factors, including mortgage availability, the cost of financing a home (in particular, mortgage terms and interest rates), unemployment levels, household formation rates, gross domestic product, residential vacancy and foreclosure rates, demand for second homes, existing housing prices, rental prices, housing inventory levels, building mix between single- and multi-family homes, consumer confidence, seasonal weather factors, the available labor pool and government regulation, policy and incentives. Non-residential construction activity is primarily driven by levels of business investment, availability of credit and interest rates, as well as many of the factors that impact residential construction activity levels.\nWuhan Host cannot control the foregoing factors and, although construction activity and related spending levels have increased in recent years, there is still uncertainty regarding whether the growth in construction market will be sustained, and there can be no assurances that there will not be any future downturns. There can be no assurances regarding whether more recent growth in these markets can be sustained or if demand will gradually decrease. If construction activity in these markets, and more generally, does not continue to recover, or if there are future downturns, whether locally, regionally or nationally, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIts dependence on key customers with whom Wuhan Host does not have long-term contracts and consolidation within its customers\u2019 industries could have a material adverse effect on Wuhan Host\u2019s operation.\nWuhan Host\u2019s business is dependent on certain key customers. In 2018 and 2017, Jiuzhou Xinyuan, its largest customer accounted for 13.3% and 0.23% of Wuhan Host\u2019s net sales, respectively. As is customary in the coating industry, Wuhan Host did not enter into long-term contracts with many of its customers. As a result, its customers could stop purchasing its products, reduce their purchase levels or request reduced pricing structures at any time. Wuhan Host may therefore need to adapt our manufacturing, pricing and marketing strategies in response to a customer who may seek concessions in return for its continued or increased business. A loss of one or more customers or a meaningful reduction in their purchases from Wuhan Host or could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in market interest rates could adversely impact Wuhan Host\nWuhan Host may need additional loans or borrowings to fund its operations. The change of interest rate may make the company face the risk of not being able to pay the principal and interest on time due to the rise of interest rate, which may lead to bankruptcy and liquidation of the company due to insolvency. Wuhan Host\u2019s earnings are impacted by changing interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans, the credit profile of existing loans, the rates received on loans and securities, and rates paid on deposits and borrowings. These impacts may negatively impact Wuhan Host\u2019s ability to attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nInterest rates may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including general and economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Market volatility in interest rates can be difficult to predict, as unexpected interest rate changes may result in a sudden impact while anticipated changes in interest rates generally impact the mortgage rate market prior to the actual rate change. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the repricing frequency of our rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities over any given period. Although we believe the current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable, significant fluctuations in interest rates could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWuhan Host business depends upon the maintenance of its proprietary technologies and information.\nWuhan Host depends on its proprietary technologies and information, many of which are no longer subject to patent protection. Wuhan Host relies principally upon trade secret and patent laws to protect its proprietary technologies. It regularly enters into confidentiality agreements with its key employees, customers, potential customers and other third parties and limit access to and distribution of its trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, these measures may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technologies or to assure that its competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, the laws of PRC in which we operate may not protect Wuhan Host\u2019s proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Wuhan Host is also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights.\nIts efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify such expenses.\nWuhan Host\u2019s future success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing technologies and customer requirements by enhancing its existing products and services. It will need to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products, features and services that address the needs of its customer base. As a result of these efforts, Wuhan Host may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. It cannot assure that it will succeed in developing, introducing and marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, it cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenues to justify the expenses and resources devoted to this product development and enhancement effort.\nJiangsu Ronghai\u2019s business and results of operations are dependent on the PRC coal markets, which may be cyclical.\nAs the revenue is substantially derived from the sale of steam coal, Jiangsu Ronghai\u2019s business and operating results are substantially dependent on the domestic supply of steam coal. The PRC coal market is cyclical and exhibits fluctuation in supply and demand from year to year and is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, economic conditions in the PRC, global economic conditions, and fluctuations in industries with high demand for coal, such as the utilities and steel industries. Fluctuations in supply and demand for coal affects coal prices which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on our operating and financial performance. The demand for coal is primarily affected by overall economic development and the demand for coal from the electricity generation, steel and construction industries. The supply of coal, on the other hand, is primarily affected by the geographic location of the coal supplies, the volume of coal produced by domestic and international coal suppliers, and the quality and price of competing sources of coal. Alternative fuels such as natural gas and oil, alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric power and nuclear power, and international shipping costs also impact the market demand for coal. Excess demand for coal may increase coal prices, which would have an adverse effect on the cost of goods sold which would, in turn, cause a short-term decline in our profitability if we are unable to increase the price of our steam coal to our customers. Local government may regulate residential winter heating price and thus causing our residential heating customers not be able to bear high steam coal price. As a result, Jiangsu Ronghai may not be able to increase its steam coal price in response to increased coal price or, Jiangsu Ronghai may have to decrease our steam coal price when it renews contracts with such customers. As a result, Jiangsu Ronghai may not able to keep its gross margin.\nOur results of operations are subject, to a significant extent, to economic, political and legal developments in the PRC.\nJiangsu Ronghai expects that a majority of coal sales will be made to customers based in the PRC. Accordingly, the economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the PRC may affect our business. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including: (i) structure; (ii) level of government involvement; (iii) level of development; (iv) growth rate; (v) control of foreign exchange and (vi) allocation of resources. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. For the past two decades, the PRC government has implemented economic reform measures emphasising the utilisation of market forces in the development of the PRC economy. Changes in the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social conditions, laws, regulations and policies could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, the PRC government indirectly influences coal prices through its regulation of power tariffs and its control over allocation of the transportation capacity of the national rail system. Any significant downturn in coal prices in the PRC could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the PRC government could adopt new policies that could shift demand away from coal to other energy sources. Any significant decline in demand for, or over-supply of, coal could materially and adversely affect our revenues from coal export sales.\nCompetition could put downward pressure on coal prices and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nJiangsu Ronghai competes with numerous other domestic and foreign coal producers for domestic sales. Overcapacity and increased production within the domestic coal industry, and decelerating steel demand in Asia have at times, and could in the future, materially reduce coal prices and therefore materially reduce our revenues and profitability. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade policies, trade concessions or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than China. We may not be able to compete on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. In addition, our ability to ship our coal to international customers depends on port capacity, which is limited. Increased competition within the coal industry for international sales could result in us not being able to obtain throughput capacity at port facilities, or the rates for such throughput capacity increasing to a point where it is not economically feasible to export our coal.\nThe domestic coal industry has experienced consolidation in recent years, including consolidation among some of our major competitors. In addition, substantial overcapacity exists in the coal industry and several other large coal companies have also filed, and others may file, bankruptcy proceedings which could enable them to lower their productions costs and thereby reduce the price for coal. Consolidation in the coal industry or current or future bankruptcy proceedings of our coal competitors could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIn addition to competing with other coal producers, Jiangsu Ronghai competes generally with producers of other fuels, such as natural gas. Natural gas pricing has declined significantly in recent years. The decline in the price of natural gas has caused demand for coal to decrease and adversely affected the price of our coal. Sustained periods of low natural gas prices have also contributed to utilities phasing out or closing existing coal-fired power plants and continued low prices could reduce or eliminate construction of any new coal-fired power plants. This trend has, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on demand and prices for our coal. Moreover, the construction of new pipelines and other natural gas distribution channels may increase competition within regional markets and thereby decrease the demand for and price of our coal.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nThe failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to mergers and acquisition of domestic enterprises by offshore special purpose vehicles may subject the company to severe fines or penalties and create other regulatory uncertainties regarding the company\u2019s corporate structure.\nOn August 8, 2006, the Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), joined by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d), the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the State Administration of Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d), the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (the \u201cSAIC\u201d), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d), jointly promulgated regulations entitled the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201cM&A Rules\u201d), which took effect as of September 8, 2006, and as amended on June 22, 2009. This regulation, among other things, has certain provisions that require offshore companies formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC individuals and companies which are the related parties with the PRC domestic companies, to obtain the approval of MOFCOM prior to engaging in such acquisitions and to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing special purpose vehicles\u2019 securities on an overseas stock market. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval.\nThe application of the M&A Rules with respect to the company\u2019s corporate structure remains unclear, with no current consensus existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules. We believe that the MOFCOM and CSRC approvals under the M&A Rules are not required in the context of the Acquisition because WFOE was incorporated as wholly owned foreign investment enterprise with the approval of local department of commerce. However, we cannot be certain that the relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC and MOFCOM, would reach the same conclusion, and we cannot be certain that MOFCOM or the CSRC will not deem that the Acquisition circumvents the M&A Rules, and other rules and notices, or that prior MOFCOM or CSRC approval is required for overseas financing.\nIf the CSRC, MOFCOM, or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC, MOFCOM or other approval was required for the Acquisition or the restructuring of Hubei Shengrong, or if prior CSRC approval for overseas financings is required and not obtained, the company may face severe regulatory actions or other sanctions from MOFCOM, the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines or other penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from overseas financings into the PRC, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends to us or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our shares of common stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to delay or cancel overseas financings, to restructure the company\u2019s corporate structure, or to seek regulatory approvals that may be difficult or costly to obtain.\nThe M&A Rules, along with certain foreign exchange regulations discussed below, will be interpreted or implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions, and we cannot predict how they will affect our acquisition strategy.\nPRC regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by PRC residents may subject The Company\u2019s PRC-resident beneficial owners or its PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into its PRC subsidiaries or limit its PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits.\nSAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as \u201cSAFE Circular 75\u201d promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC resident holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Moreover, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.\nSAFE promulgated the Notice of SAFE on Further Simplifying and Improving Policies for the Foreign Exchange Administration of Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, on February 13, 2015, which was effective on June 1, 2015. SAFE Circular 13 cancels two administrative approval items: foreign exchange registration under domestic direct investment and foreign exchange registration under overseas direct investment, instead. Banks shall directly examine and handle foreign exchange registration under domestic direct investment and foreign exchange registration under overseas direct investment, and SAFE and its branch shall indirectly regulate the foreign exchange registration of direct investment through banks.\nMs. Jiazhen Li and Mr. Xiaonian Zhang have completed registration under SAFE Circular 37 when they are the majority beneficiary owners of the Company. But, after the reorganization of Hubei Shengrong, they becoming the indirect shareholders of the The Company via a co-owned BVICo, such shareholding structure change of the The Company has not completed the modification registered with local SAFE according to Circular 37. However, The Company may not be aware of the identities of all of its beneficial owners who are PRC residents. The Company does not have control over its beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of its PRC-resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37, SAFE Circular 13 and subsequent implementation rules. The failure of its beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, SAFE Circular 13 and subsequent implementation rules, or the failure of future beneficial owners of The Company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37, SAFE Circular 13 and subsequent implementation rules, may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Furthermore, since SAFE Circular 37 and SAFE Circular 13 was recently promulgated and it is unclear how this regulation, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities, The Company cannot predict how these regulations will affect its business operations or future strategy. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries and limit its PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to The Company. These risks may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf either Wuhan Host or Jiangsu Rong Hai fails to maintain the requisite registered capital, licenses and approvals required under PRC law, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nForeign investment is highly regulated by the PRC government and local authorities. Both Wuhan HOST and Jiangsu Ronghai are required to obtain and maintain certain licenses or approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to operate its current business. These licenses and approvals will be essential to the operation of their businesses. If either Wuhan HOST or Jiangsu Ronghai fails to obtain or maintain any of the required licenses or approvals for its business, we may be subject to various penalties, such as fines and the discontinuation or restriction of its operations. Any such disruption in the business operations of Wuhan HOST or Jiangsu Ronghai could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nA slowdown of the Chinese economy or adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could negatively impact China\u2019s overall economic growth, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nAfter the Business Combination, we are now a holding company and all of the combined company\u2019s operations will be entirely conducted in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown in recent years, the pace of growth has slowed, and even that rate of growth may not continue. The annual rate of growth in the PRC declined from 6.9% in 2017 to 6.6% in 2018. According to a recent State Information of China forecast, China\u2019s economic growth rate in 2019 will slow to 6.2%, its lowest since 1990. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC may materially reduce the demand for the combined company\u2019s products and may have a materially adverse effect on its business.\nChina\u2019s economy differs from the economies of most other countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement in the economy, the general level of economic development, growth rates and government control of foreign exchange and the allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has grown significantly over the past few decades, this growth has remained uneven across different periods, regions and economic sectors.\nThe PRC government also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth by allocating resources, controlling the payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Any actions and policies adopted by the PRC government could negatively impact the Chinese economy or the economy of the region the combined company serves, which could materially adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business.\nSubstantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business the combined company may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of its operations and financial condition.\nThe combined company\u2019s business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which the combined company must conduct its business activities. The combined company\u2019s ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activities and greater economic decentralization. However, the government of the PRC may not continue to pursue these policies, or may significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice.\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing the combined company\u2019s business, or the enforcement and performance of the combined company\u2019s arrangements with borrowers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy or criminal proceedings. Only after 1979 did the Chinese government begin to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws that regulate economic affairs in general, deal with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, as well as encourage foreign investment in China. Although the influence of the law has been increasing, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. Also, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. In addition, there have been constant changes and amendments of laws and regulations over the past 30 years in order to keep up with the rapidly changing society and economy in China. Because government agencies and courts provide interpretations of laws and regulations and decide contractual disputes and issues, their inexperience in adjudicating new business and new polices or regulations in certain less developed areas causes uncertainty and may affect the combined company\u2019s business. Consequently, neither we nor Hubei Shengrong and TJComex can predict the future direction of Chinese legislative activities with respect to either businesses with foreign investment or the effectiveness on enforcement of laws and regulations in China. The uncertainties, including new laws and regulations and changes of existing laws, as well as judicial interpretation by inexperienced officials in the agencies and courts in certain areas, may cause possible problems to foreign investors.\nBoth Wuhan HOST and Jiangsu Ronghai\u2019s businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by state, provincial and local government authorities, which may interfere with the way the combined company conducts its business and may negatively impact its financial results.\nBoth Wuhan HOST and Jiangsu Ronghai are subject to extensive and complex state, provincial and local laws, rules and regulations with regard to their loan operations, capital structure, maximum interest rates, allowance for loan losses, among other things, as set out in \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations.\u201d These laws, rules and regulations are issued by different central government ministries and departments, provincial and local governments and are enforced by different local authorities in Hubei Province, the city of Wuhan and the city of Suzhou. As a result of the complexity, uncertainties and constant changes in these laws, rules and regulation, including changes in interpretation and implementation of such, both Wuhan HOST and Jiangsu Ronghai\u2019s business activities and growth may be adversely affected if they do not respond to the changes in a timely manner or are found to be in violation of the applicable laws, regulations and policies as a result of a different position from theirs taken by the competent authority in the interpretation of such applicable laws, regulations and policies. If Wuhan HOST and Jiangsu Ronghai are found to be not in compliance with these laws and regulations, they may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities, monetary penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business operations and profitability.\nFailure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties.\nWe are required under PRC laws and regulations to participate in various government sponsored employee benefit plans, including certain social insurance, housing funds and other welfare-oriented payment obligations, and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of our employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at locations where we operate our businesses. The requirement of employee benefit plans has not been implemented consistently by the local governments in China given the different levels of economic development in different locations. We have not made adequate employee benefit payments. We may be required to make up the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines, the amount payable of which shall be determined in accordance with 110% of the amount paid by us in the preceding month. If we are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the underpaid employee benefits, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions against us or our management, in China, based upon United States laws, including the U.S. federal securities laws, or other foreign laws.\nWe are a company incorporated in Nevada. After the Business Combination, substantially all of our operations will be conducted in China, and substantially all of our assets will be located in China. All of our current and proposed directors and officers reside in China, and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, Allbright Law, our counsel as to PRC law, has advised us that it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or to enforce judgments against us which are obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nAllbright Law has further advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United States providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors or officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC laws, national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nAllbright Law has also advised us that in the event shareholders originate an action against a company without domicile in China for disputes related to contracts or other property interests, the PRC courts may accept a cause of action if (a) the disputed contract is concluded or performed in the PRC or the disputed subject matter is located in the PRC, (b) the company (as defendant) has properties that can be seized within the PRC, (c) the company has a representative organization within the PRC, or (d) the parties chose to submit to the jurisdiction of the PRC courts in the contract on the condition that such submission does not violate the requirements of jurisdiction under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. The action may be initiated by the shareholder by filing a complaint with the PRC courts. The PRC courts would determine whether to accept the complaint in accordance with the PRC Civil Procedures Law. The shareholder may participate in the action by itself or entrust any other person or PRC legal counsel to participate on behalf of such shareholder. Foreign citizens and companies will have the same rights as PRC citizens and companies in such an action unless such foreign country restricts the rights of PRC citizens and companies.\nOur ability to pay dividends may be restricted due to foreign exchange control and other regulations of China.\nAs an offshore holding company, we will rely principally on dividends from our subsidiary in China, WFOE, for our cash requirements. Under the applicable PRC laws and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise in China is required to set aside a portion of its after-tax profit to fund specific reserve funds prior to payment of dividends. In particular, at least 10% of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards each year is required to be set aside towards its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.\nFurthermore, WFOE\u2019s ability to pay dividends may be restricted due to foreign exchange control policies and the availability of its cash balance. Substantially all of the Operating Companies\u2019 operations are conducted in China and all of the revenue we recognize, through WFOE will be denominated in RMB. RMB is subject to exchange control regulation in China, and, as a result, WFOE may be unable to distribute any dividends outside of China due to PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into U.S. dollars.\nThe lack of dividends or other payments from WFOE may limit our ability to make investments or Business Combinations that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends or otherwise fund, and conduct our business. Our funds may not be readily available to us to satisfy obligations which have been incurred outside the PRC, which could adversely affect our business and prospects or our ability to meet our cash obligations. Accordingly, if we do not receive dividends from WFOE, our liquidity and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nDividends payable to our foreign investors and gains on the sale of our shares of common stock by our foreign investors may become subject to tax by the PRC.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation regulations issued by the State Council of the PRC, a 10% PRC withholding tax is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are non-resident enterprises, which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or which have such establishment or place of business but the dividends are not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of shares by such investors is also subject to PRC tax at a current rate of 10%, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in relevant tax treaties, if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. If we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid on our shares, and any gain realized from the transfer of our shares, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and would as a result be subject to PRC taxation. Furthermore, if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends payable to individual investors who are non-PRC residents and any gain realized on the transfer shares by such investors may be subject to PRC tax at a current rate of 20%, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in applicable tax treaties. It is unclear whether we or any of our subsidiaries established outside of China are considered a PRC resident enterprise, holders of shares would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between China and other countries or areas. If dividends payable to our non-PRC investors, or gains from the transfer of our shares by such investors are subject to PRC tax, the value of your investment in our shares may decline significantly.\nOur global income may be subject to PRC taxes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the New EIT Law, and its amendment and implementation rules, which became effective in January 2008, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a \u201cde facto management body\u201d located within the PRC is considered a PRC resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation rules define the term \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d as \u201cestablishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finance and treasury, and Business Combination and disposition of properties and other assets of an enterprise.\u201d On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation (the \u201cSAT\u201d), issued a circular, or SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the \u201cde facto management body\u201d of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although the SAT Circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determining criteria set forth in the SAT Circular 82 may reflect the SAT\u2019s general position on how the \u201cde facto management body\u201d text should be applied in determining the resident status of all offshore enterprises for the purpose of PRC tax, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals. Although we do not believe that our legal entities organized outside of the PRC constitute PRC resident enterprises, it is possible that the PRC tax authorities could reach a different conclusion. In such case, we may be considered a PRC resident enterprise and may therefore be subject to the 25% enterprise income tax on our global income, which could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. In addition to the uncertainty regarding how the new PRC resident enterprise classification for tax purposes may apply, it is also possible that the rules may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect.\nWe and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the State Administration of Taxation issued an Announcement on Several Issues Concerning Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Announcement 7, with the same effective date. Under Announcement 7, an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d refers to a transaction where a non-resident enterprise transfers its equity interest and other similar interest in an offshore holding company, which directly or indirectly holds Chinese taxable assets (the assets of an \u201cestablishment or place\u201d situated in China; real property situated in China and equity interest in Chinese resident enterprises) and any indirect transfer without reasonable commercial purposes are subject to the PRC taxation. In addition, Announcement 7 specifies the conditions under which an indirect transfer is deemed to lack a reasonable commercial purpose which include: (1) 75% or more of the value of the offshore holding company\u2019s equity is derived from Chinese taxable assets, (2) anytime in the year prior to the occurrence of the indirect transfer of Chinese taxable assets, 90% or more of the total assets (excluding cash) of the offshore holding company are direct or indirect investment in China, or 90% or more of the revenue of the offshore holding company was sourced from China; (3) the functions performed and risks assumed by the offshore holding company(ies), although incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction to conform to the corporate law requirements there, are insufficient to substantiate their corporate existence and (4) the foreign income tax payable in respect of the indirect transfer is lower than the Chinese tax which would otherwise be payable in respect of the direct transfer if such transfer were treated as a direct transfer. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, currently at a rate of 10%.\nAnnouncement 7 grants a safe harbor under certain qualifying circumstances, including transfers in the public securities market and certain intragroup restricting transactions, however, there is uncertainty as to the implementation of Announcement 7. For example, Announcement 7 requires the buyer to withhold the applicable taxes without specifying how to obtain the information necessary to calculate taxes and when the applicable tax shall be submitted. Announcement 7 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to our offshore restructuring transactions or sale of the shares of our offshore subsidiaries where non-resident enterprises, being the transferors, were involved. Though Announcement 7 does not impose a mandatory obligation of filing the report of taxable events, the transferring party shall be subject to PRC withholding tax if the certain tax filing conditions are met. Non-filing may result in an administrative penalty varying from 50% to 300% of unpaid taxes. As a result, we and our non-resident enterprises in such transactions may become at risk of being subject to taxation under Announcement 7, and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Announcement 7 or to establish that we and our non-resident enterprises should not be taxed under Announcement 7, for any restructuring or disposal of shares of our offshore subsidiaries, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnhanced scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions we may pursue in the future.\nThe PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of certain taxable assets, including, in particular, equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, by a non-resident enterprise by promulgating and implementing SAT Circular 59 and Circular 698, which became effective in January 2008, and a Circular 7 in replacement of some of the existing rules in Circular 698, which became effective in February 2015.\nUnder Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d by transferring the equity interests of a PRC \u201cresident enterprise\u201d indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.\nIn February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a \u201csubstance over form\u201d principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.\nWe face uncertainties on the reporting and consequences on future private equity financing transactions, share exchange or other transactions involving the transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises. The PRC tax authorities may pursue such non-resident enterprises with respect to a filing or the transferees with respect to withholding obligation, and request our PRC subsidiaries to assist in the filing. As a result, we and non-resident enterprises in such transactions may become at risk of being subject to filing obligations or being taxed, under Circular 59 or Circular 698 and Circular 7, and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 59, Circular 698 and Circular 7 or to establish that we and our non-resident enterprises should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PRC tax authorities have the discretion under SAT Circular 59, Circular 698 and Circular 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the taxable assets transferred and the cost of investment. Although we currently have no plans to pursue any acquisitions in China or elsewhere in the world, we may pursue acquisitions in the future that may involve complex corporate structures. If we are considered a non-resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and if the PRC tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of the transactions under SAT Circular 59 or Circular 698 and Circular 7, our income tax costs associated with such potential acquisitions will be increased, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our revenue effectively.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi. The Renminbi is currently convertible under the \u201ccurrent account,\u201d which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the \u201ccapital account,\u201d which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our PRC subsidiaries, which are wholly-foreign owned enterprises, may purchase foreign currency for settlement of \u201ccurrent account transactions,\u201d including payment of dividends to us, without the approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in Renminbi, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside of the PRC or pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, SAFE or banks and other relevant PRC governmental authorities. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for all of our PRC subsidiaries.\nFluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between U.S. Dollars and Renminbi could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate. Exchange rates are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under this policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of foreign currencies. Following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over three years. From July 2008 until June 2010, however, the RMB traded stably within a narrow range against the U.S. dollar. On June 20, 2010, the PBOC announced that the PRC government would reform the RMB exchange rate regime and increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. Since June 2010, the RMB has appreciated more than 10% against the U.S. dollar. In April 2012, the PRC government announced it would allow greater RMB exchange rate fluctuation. On August 11, 12 and 13, 2015, the PRC government successively set the central parity rate for the RMB more than 3% lower in the aggregate than that of August 10, 2015 and announced that it will begin taking into account previous day\u2019s trading in setting the central parity rate. In 2015, the yuan experienced a 4.88% drop in value, and on January 4, 2016 the PRC government set the U.S. dollar-Chinese yuan currency pair to a reference rate of 6.5%, the lowest rate in 4.5 years, on January 6, 2017, the reference rate was 0.9% up-regulated by the PRC government. However, it is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. As significant international pressure remains on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, greater fluctuation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could result.\nOur revenues and costs are mostly denominated in the RMB, and a significant portion of our financial assets are also denominated in the RMB. Any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar may materially adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the amount of and any dividends we may pay on our shares in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar could also result in foreign currency translation losses for financial reporting purposes.\nIf any dividend is declared in the future and paid in a foreign currency, you may be taxed on a larger amount in U.S. dollars than the U.S. dollar amount that you will actually ultimately receive.\nIf you are a U.S. holder of our shares of common stock, you will be taxed on the U.S. dollar value of your dividends, if any, at the time you receive them, even if you actually receive a smaller amount of U.S. dollars when the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Specifically, if a dividend is declared and paid in a foreign currency such as the RMB, the amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income as a U.S. holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the payments made in the foreign currency, determined at the spot rate of the foreign currency to the U.S. dollar on the date the dividend distribution is includible in your income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Thus, if the value of the foreign currency decreases before you actually convert the currency into U.S. dollars, you will be taxed on a larger amount in U.S. dollars than the U.S. dollar amount that you will actually ultimately receive.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit economic activity and adversely affect the combined company\u2019s operations.\nThe Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion in recent years which can lead to high rates of inflation or deflation. This has caused the PRC government to, from time to time, enact various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the PRC government to once again impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China. Any action on the part of the PRC government that seeks to control credit and/or prices may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business operations.\nPRC laws and regulations have established more complex procedures for certain acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for the combined company to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nFurther to the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the New M&A Rules, the Anti-monopoly Law of the PRC, the Rules of Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated by MOFCOM or the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, was issued in August 2011, which established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change of control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC enterprise, or that the approval from MOFCOM be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies. PRC laws and regulations also require certain merger and acquisition transactions to be subject to merger control review and or security review.\nThe MOFCOM Security Review Rules, effective from September 1, 2011, which implement the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated on February 3, 2011, further provide that, when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise by foreign investors is subject to the security review by MOFCOM, the principle of substance over form should be applied and foreign investors are prohibited from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through agreements control or offshore transactions.\nFurther, if the business of any target company that the combined company seek to acquire falls into the scope of security review, the combined company may not be able to successfully acquire such company either by equity or asset acquisition, capital contribution or through any contractual agreements. The combined company may grow its business in part by acquiring other companies operating in its industry. Complying with the requirements of the relevant regulations to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including approval from MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit its ability to complete such transactions, which could affect its ability to maintain or expand its market share.\nIn addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Circular 19, on June 1, 2015. Under Circular 19, registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies may only be used within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and the equity investments in the PRC made by the foreign-invested company shall be subject to the relevant laws and regulations about the foreign-invested company\u2019s reinvestment in the PRC. In addition, foreign-invested companies cannot use such capital to make the investments on securities, and cannot use such capital to issue the entrusted RMB loans (except approved in its business scope), repay the RMB loans between the enterprises and the ones which have been transferred to the third party. Circular 19 may significantly limit our ability to effectively use the proceeds from future financing activities as the Chinese subsidiaries may not convert the funds received from us in foreign currencies into RMB, which may adversely affect their liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in the PRC.\nSAFE issued the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts (\u201cCircular 16\u201d), on June 9, 2016, which became effective simultaneously. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on self-discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purpose beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC Laws or regulations, while such converted RMB shall not be provide as loans to its non-affiliated entities. As Circular 16 is newly issued and SAFE has not provided detailed guidelines with respect to its interpretation or implementation, it is uncertain how these rules will be interpreted and implemented.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nAs our shares are listed on Nasdaq, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Non-U.S. companies, including some that may compete with us, may not be subject to these prohibitions. In addition, in 2012, the central government of the PRC commenced a far-reaching campaign against corruption. That ongoing campaign involves aggressive enforcement of existing Chinese anti-corruption laws. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in the PRC. Our employees or other agents may engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSEC administrative proceedings against the China affiliates of multi-national accounting firms, and/or any related adverse regulatory development in the PRC, may result in our financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.\nIn December 2012, the SEC brought administrative proceedings against five major accounting firms in China alleging that they had refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain other China-based companies under investigation by the SEC. On January 22, 2014, an initial administrative law decision was issued, censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of these firms from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The decision is neither final nor legally effective unless and until reviewed and approved by the SEC. On February 12, 2014, four of these PRC-based accounting firms appealed to the SEC against this decision. In February 2015, each of the four PRC-based accounting firms agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC. The settlement requires the firms to follow detailed procedures to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms\u2019 audit documents via the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission. If the firms do not follow these procedures, the SEC could restart the administrative proceedings.\nIn the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings or initiates new proceedings against other firms, depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, United States-listed companies and the market price of our shares may be adversely affected.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm was denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to our delisting from Nasdaq or deregistration from the SEC, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our shares in the United States.\nOur management team is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.\nOur current management team are not familiar with United States securities laws. Given the complexity of United States securities laws, our management team may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues, which may adversely affect our operations.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations and our reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our shares, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our company and our business. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend the Company. This situation may be a major distraction to our management. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely hampered and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC.\nOur reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Our SEC filings and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review by CSRC, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any review of our company, our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as:\n\u25cf the perception of U.S. investors and regulators of U.S. listed Chinese companies;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf negative publicity, studies or reports;\n\u25cf conditions in Chinese credit markets;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other microcredit companies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in China.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nVolatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our common stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThere is no guarantee that our warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless and the terms of our warrants may be amended.\nThe exercise price for our warrants is $2.88 per one-half of one share ($5.75 per whole share), subject to adjustment. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of the Company\u2019s common stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. There is no guarantee that the warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and they may expire worthless.\nA market for the Company\u2019s securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of the Company\u2019s securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if the Company\u2019s securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, the Nasdaq Capital Market for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s securities may be volatile.\nFactors affecting the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities may include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf success of competitors;\n\u25cf our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company or the lending market in general;\n\u25cf operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u25cf our ability to market new and enhanced services on a timely basis;\n\u25cf changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets as needed;\n\u25cf changes in the Company\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf the volume of common stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf any major change in our board or management;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of the Company\u2019s securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Capital Market in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe have not registered the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants and causing such warrants to expire worthless.\nWe have not registered the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such shares and maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and to use our best efforts to take such action as is necessary to register or qualify for sale, in those states in which the warrants were initially offered by us, the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to the extent an exemption is not available. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement. However, except as specified in the warrant agreement, in no event will we be required to issue cash, securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants if we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified, the warrant holder will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of common stock included in the units. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying shares of common stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nWarrants will become exercisable for the Company\u2019s shares of common stocks, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our shareholders.\nEach warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one shares of common stock at a price of $2.88 per half share ($5.75 per whole share), subject to adjustment. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of the Company\u2019s share of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of warrants. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stocks will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then existing holders of shares of common stock of the Company and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 90% of the then outstanding warrants.\nOur warrants are issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 90% of the then outstanding warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 90% of the then outstanding warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 90% of the then outstanding warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. Our sponsor owns warrants equal to 61.9% of our issued and outstanding warrants. Accordingly, our sponsor may exert a substantial and decisive influence on actions relating to a vote to amend the terms of the warrants, as set forth above.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants (excluding any placement warrants held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees) at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price (or the closing bid price of our common stock in the event the shares of our common stock are not traded on any specific trading day) of the common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day prior to the date we send proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you: (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its warrant (including any warrants held by our sponsor, officers, directors or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements. Such reduced disclosure may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we will elect to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital when we need to do it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations that affect public companies, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with Section 404(b) and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as Section 14 rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ. In addition, our management team will also have to adapt to the requirements of being a public company. We expect that compliance with these rules and regulations will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. Additionally, if these requirements divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under our certificate of incorporation and the existence of indemnification of our directors, officers and employees under Nevada law may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions which eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to us and our stockholders to the maximum extent permitted under the corporate laws of Nevada. We may also provide contractual indemnification obligations under agreements with our directors, officers and employees. These indemnification obligations could result in our incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors, officers and employees, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors, officers and employees for breach of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors, officers and employees even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 15664, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "CCNC"}
