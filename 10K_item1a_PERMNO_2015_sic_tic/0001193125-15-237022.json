RISK FACTORS\nOur recent emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business loans has increased our credit risk.\nWe have significantly increased our origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans during the last five years, and we intend to continue to grow our portfolios of such loans in the near term, subject to market conditions. At March 31, 2015, commercial real estate loans totaled $59.3 million, or 37.0% of total loans, compared to $21.0 million, or 11.7% of total loans, at March 31, 2011. At March 31, 2015, commercial business loans and lines of credit outstanding totaled $18.5 million, or 11.5% of total loans, compared to $19.4 million, or 10.8% of total loans, at March 31, 2011. We have increased our origination of commercial business loans over the last few years to replace the commercial business loans we have charged-off due to poor asset quality or lost to other financial institutions based upon market terms.\nCommercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, a downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. See \u201c-Our entry into commercial real estate and commercial business lending has resulted in higher losses on our loans,\u201d below.\nOur entry into commercial real estate and commercial business lending has resulted in higher losses on our loans.\nBeginning in 2009, we changed our business strategy to become less reliant upon one- to four-family lending and emphasize commercial business and commercial real estate lending. To support this strategy, we have hired additional commercial real estate and commercial loan officers with commercial lending experience, as well as enhanced our back office monitoring and loan administration with additional personnel. We are now performing the underwriting analysis of such loans in-house versus contracting with an outside third party in past years. We have also purchased whole commercial business and commercial real estate loans from other institutions and participated in commercial business and commercial real estate loans originated by other institutions in the past. Although we do not actively seek to participate in or purchase such loans from other financial institutions, we do look at opportunities on a case by case basis if they present themselves.\nBeginning in 2011, the level of our delinquent and non-performing commercial and commercial real estate (including commercial construction) loans began to increase, particularly in our portfolio of loan participations and purchased loans. During fiscal 2012, nonperforming loans increased $5.8 million, or 354%, to $7.4 million at March 31, 2012. Of the $7.4 million in nonperforming loans, $6.3 million were related to commercial real estate and commercial business loans. As a result of this large increase, we experienced charge-offs of $3.2 million and $2.3 million in fiscal 2013 and 2014, respectively. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans accounted for over 90% of the charge-offs in both those fiscal years. Through workout and charge-offs, as well as a thorough review of the commercial loan portfolio, we were able to reduce our nonperforming loans from $7.4 million at March 31, 2012 to $2.3 million at March 31, 2015. Commercial real estate loans comprised $1.4 million of the $2.3 million in nonperforming loans at March 31, 2015, while commercial business loans accounted for $226,000 of that total. We were able to reduce the number of charge-offs on loans to $323,000 during fiscal 2015, including $83,000 in charge-offs associated with commercial loans.\nGiven our recent emphasis on commercial business and commercial real estate lending, and that our portfolio of commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans is not seasoned, we have a limited loss history with which to measure the level of risk in our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios. In addition, with our in-house underwriting function for commercial business and commercial real\nestate loans being relatively new, we have a limited history on which to assess the effectiveness of our commercial business and commercial real estate loan underwriting processes and personnel. Delinquencies and loan losses related to our commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans could increase more than we have provided for in our allowance for loan losses as we continue to emphasize this type of lending activity.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance for loan losses. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are established through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income.\nThe unseasoned nature of much of our commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans increases the risk that our allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses without significant additional provisions. See \u201c-Our recent emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business loans has increased our credit risk,\u201d and \u201c-Our entry into commercial real estate and commercial business lending has resulted in higher losses on our loans,\u201d above. At March 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses was $1.7 million, or 74.9% of non-performing loans.\nMaterial additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nDuring the past six years it has been the policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d) to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, yields on securities we have purchased, and to a lesser extent, market rates on the loans we have originated, have been at levels lower than were available prior to 2008. Consequently, the average yield on our interest earning assets has decreased during the recent low interest rate environment. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which has resulted in increases in net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities) in the short term. However, our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has indicated its intention to maintain low interest rates until it believes appropriate progress has been made toward its objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Accordingly, our net interest income may be adversely affected and may even decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability. For information with respect to changes in interest rates, see \u201c-Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\u201d below.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand (which would also decrease our ability to generate noninterest income through the sale of loans into the secondary market and related fees for continuing to service those sold\nloans, particularly SBA loans sold) and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. In addition, as market interest rates rise, we will have competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits. Because interest rates we pay on our deposits would be expected to increase more quickly than the increase in the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income would be adversely affected.\nWe also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities.\nWe could potentially recognize goodwill impairment charges.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had $2.7 million of goodwill related to the acquisition of our Pasadena, Maryland branch office in 2009. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of Hamilton Bank be compared to the carrying amount of the Bank\u2019s net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the Bank is less than book value, an expense may be required to write-down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value. We test for impairment of goodwill during February of each year. As a result of impairment testing performed during February 2015, no impairment charge was recorded. However, future declines in our banking franchise value could result in goodwill impairment expense that is material to our earnings.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry within our market area is intense. In our market area we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and broader range of deposit and loan products offered by our competition may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets and profitability. We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our ability to successfully implement our business plan, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the future.\nA worsening of economic conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur markets have been adversely impacted by the severe national economic recession of 2008 and 2009. Recovery by many businesses has been impaired by lower consumer spending. If the Federal Reserve Board increases the federal funds rate, higher interest rates would likely result, which may reduce our loan originations, and housing markets and U.S. economic activity would be negatively affected.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends on the general economic conditions in the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our commercial real estate and construction and consumer loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Almost all of our loans are to borrowers located in the greater Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area or secured by collateral located in the greater Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area.\nA further deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged delay in economic recovery in the market areas we serve, in particular the greater Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline further in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of our low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, our primary federal regulators, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Hamilton Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nIncome from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses or charges with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations which would negatively affect our earnings.\nWe generally sell in the secondary market all residential mortgage loans that we originate with terms over 10 years on a servicing released basis, earning noninterest income in the form of gains on sale. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans available for sale. In addition to interest rate levels, weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. We do sell loans in the secondary market with recourse based upon delinquency or break of customary representations and warranties we provide to the buyers. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers can require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase. Since 2009, we have outsourced the loan processing and underwriting functions with respect to loans that we intend to sell in the secondary market to a third-party company. While we review each application to ensure compliance with secondary market standards, there may be some additional risk in outsourcing these functions to a third party rather than utilizing our own employees. If our relationship with this third-party loan processor/underwriter were to terminate, we would incur additional costs to undertake such functions using our own employees. In addition, if our current third-party arrangement were to be terminated, we may not be able to process and underwrite the same volume of loans for the secondary market using our own employees, which could result in reduced income.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives may affect our business activities and increase operating costs.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending, funding practices, capital, and liquidity standards. Bank regulatory agencies are expected to be more active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders. In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes may also increase our compliance costs and affect our business and operations. Moreover, the FDIC sets the cost of our FDIC insurance premiums, which can affect our profitability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of insured depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directs changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandates the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies, requires originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, stipulates regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repeals restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The impact of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot yet be fully assessed. However, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense.\nNew laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 13642, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "HBK"}
