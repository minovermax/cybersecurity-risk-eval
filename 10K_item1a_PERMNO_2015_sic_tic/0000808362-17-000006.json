{"cik": "808362", "company": "BAKER HUGHES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks. When considering an investment in Baker Hughes, one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below, as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and matters not listed below, that we are unaware of, or that we currently consider immaterial. Any of these may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in Baker Hughes.\nRisk Factors Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nOur business is focused on providing products and services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry; therefore, our risk factors include those factors that impact, either positively or negatively, the markets for oil and natural gas. Expenditures by our customers for exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are based on their expectations of future hydrocarbon demand, their expectations for future energy prices, the risks associated with developing the reserves, their ability to finance exploration for and development of reserves, and the future value of the reserves. Their evaluation of the future value is based, in part, on their expectations for global demand, global supply, spare productive capacity, inventory levels and other factors that influence oil and natural gas prices. The key risk factors we believe are currently influencing the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below.\nDemand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results. Changes in the global economy could impact our customers' spending levels and our revenue and operating results.\nDemand for oil and natural gas, as well as the demand for our services, is highly correlated with global economic growth, and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the U.S., India, China, and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East who are either significant users of oil and natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global average. Weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit markets could reduce our customers' spending levels and reduce our revenue and operating results. Events such as Britain's vote in late June 2016 to leave the European Union and incremental weakness in global economic activity, particularly in China, India, Europe, the Middle East and developing countries in Asia, could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices. Incremental strength in global economic activity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas prices. In addition, demand for oil and natural gas could be impacted by environmental regulation, including cap and trade legislation, regulation of hydraulic fracturing, carbon taxes and the cost for carbon capture and sequestration related regulations.\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nProductive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers' decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulation in the future.\nProductive capacity in excess of demand (\"spare productive capacity\") is also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies. Spare productive capacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand. High or increasing storage, inventories, or spare productive capacity generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften. Low or decreasing storage, inventories, or spare productive capacity are generally an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise.\nAccess to prospects is also important to our customers and such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves. Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced.\nSupply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries, including, but not limited to, Norway and Russia, are willing and able to control production and exports of oil, to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives. Any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nVolatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Since 2014, oil prices have declined significantly due in large part to increasing supplies, weakening demand growth and OPEC's position to not cut production until the fourth quarter of 2016. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels.\nLower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nOur customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets.\nOur customers' access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices, required investments and resulting returns. Limited access to external sources of funding has and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally-generated cash flow. In addition, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts.\nSeasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers' operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Extreme winter conditions in Canada, Russia or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers' operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business\nOur expectations regarding our business are affected by the following risk factors and the timing of any of these risk factors:\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield services and securing equipment and trained personnel. Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. In order to be competitive, we must provide new technologies, reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers, and successfully recruit, train and retain competent personnel. Our investments in new technologies and property, plant and equipment may not provide competitive returns. Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry's capacity relative to customer demand, and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors' products and services.\nManaging development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at forecasted costs can impact our financial results. Development of competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services can have a detrimental impact on our financial results.\nWe may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active.\nThe high cost or unavailability of infrastructure, materials, equipment, supplies and personnel, particularly in periods of rapid growth, could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories. Our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an\nimpact on our business, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals, control costs, and avoid shortages or over supply of raw materials and component parts. Raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys (including chromium and nickel), titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks. Our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers. A lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog, which may limit our ability to respond to orders with short lead times.\nPeople are a key resource to developing, manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world. Our ability to manage the recruiting, training, retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business. A well-trained, motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business. Periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit, train and retain our employees, while managing the impact of wage inflation and potential lack of available qualified labor in the markets where we operate.\nLikewise, if the downturn in the economy or our markets continues, we may have to adjust our workforce to control costs and may lose our skilled and diverse workforce. Labor-related actions, including strikes, slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business.\nOur business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats.\nGeopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we do business. Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our ability to conduct our operations.\nOur business operations may be impacted by civil unrest, government expropriations and/or epidemic outbreaks.\nIn addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks, civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business. Our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest. Epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by, among other things, restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our customers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas.\nOur business could be impacted by cybersecurity risks and threats.\nThreats to our information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow and it is possible that breaches to our systems could go unnoticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, disruption of our customers' operations, loss or damage to our customer data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nOur failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nOur ability to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents and business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees. Our compliance program is also dependent on the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and the Baker Hughes Business Code of Conduct. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees.\nCompliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.\nWe conduct business in the U.S. and in more than 80 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. Compliance related issues could\nalso limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings. Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate. In addition, government disruptions, such as a U.S. government shutdown, may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results.\nThe U.S. and global tax environment today is evolving rapidly with a number of countries in which we operate enacting, or planning to enact, legislative changes that conform to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (\"OECD\") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"BEPS\") project or otherwise make fundamental modifications to their tax regimes. These changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact operating results, including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization. If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially impacted.\nOur tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. We have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters. These audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of any tax matter involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.\nChanges in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling may adversely affect our business and operating results and reduce the need for our services in those areas.\nLegislation and regulation in the U.S. and other parts of the world of the offshore oil and natural gas industry may result in substantial increases in costs or delays in drilling or other operations in the Gulf of Mexico and other parts of the world, oil and natural gas projects becoming potentially non-economic, and a corresponding reduced demand for our services. If the U.S. or other countries where we operate, enact stricter restrictions on offshore drilling or further regulate offshore drilling or contracting services operations, higher operating costs could result and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf the Company were to be involved in a future incident similar to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident, the Company could suffer significant financial losses that could severely impair the Company. Protections available to the Company through contractual terms and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to protect the Company in the event we were involved in that type of an incident.\nCompliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our or our customers' operations may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business is impacted by material changes in environmental laws, rulings and litigation. Our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws, including (without limitation) our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, are only our forecasts regarding these matters. These forecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which may be affected by factors such as: changes in law that impose new restrictions on air emissions, wastewater management, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing, or wetland and land use practices; more stringent enforcement of existing environmental regulations; a change in our allocation or other unexpected, adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a PRP, including (without limitation) Superfund sites; the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations; and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials.\nInternational, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions. In the U.S., the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among others, certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry, which in turn may include data from some of our wellsite equipment and operations. The EPA has also proposed other related GHG emission standards that are applicable to the oil and natural gas industry, including several targeting methane, some of which have been adopted. The impact of these standards on our business, both proposed and adopted, remains unclear given recent actions taken by Congress and the current U.S. Administration. Other developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol; the European Union Emission Trading System; and, the United Kingdom's Carbon Reduction Commitment which affects more than 40 Baker Hughes facilities. Other regulatory changes have been proposed related to climate change including emissions trading schemes, carbon taxes and emissions reduction targets in various areas across the globe.\nWe are unable to predict whether proposed changes in laws or regulations will ultimately occur or what the adopted and proposed changes will ultimately require, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business. In addition, current or future legislation, regulations and developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations.\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings. We have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available; however, no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation. This insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. The insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices. In addition, the following risks apply with respect to our insurance coverage:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance;\n\u2022\nour insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or\n\u2022\nthe dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits.\nWhenever possible, we obtain agreements from customers that limit our liability. However, state law, laws or public policy in countries outside the U.S., or the negotiated terms of the agreement with the customer may not recognize those limitations of liability and/or limit the customer's indemnity obligations to the Company. In addition, insurance and customer agreements do not provide complete protection against losses and risks from an event like a well control failure that can lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance.\nControl of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and create additional risks in our operations.\nMuch of the world's oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by state-owned oil companies. State-owned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as joint ventures, that could be difficult or undesirable for the Company to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact the Company's operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with state-owned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.\nProviding services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require the Company to assume additional risks.\nMany state-owned oil companies and other operators may require integrated contracts or turnkey contracts and the Company may choose to provide services outside its core business. Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis generally subjects the Company to additional risks, such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements.\nCurrency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results.\nFluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business. Most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in U.S. Dollars or local currency indexed to U.S. Dollars; however, some of our revenue, local expenses and manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies can increase or decrease our revenue and expenses reported in U.S. Dollars and may impact our results of operations.\nChanges in economic and/or market conditions may impact our ability to borrow and/or cost of borrowing.\nThe condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing, if necessary. If the Company's credit rating is downgraded, this could increase borrowing costs under our credit facility and commercial paper program, as well as the cost of renewing or obtaining, or make it more difficult to renew or obtain or issue new debt financing.\nOur restructuring activities may not achieve the results we expect and could increase, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring 2015 and 2016, we implemented a number of restructuring activities to reduce expenses, which included a reduction in our workforce, the termination of various contracts, the closing or abandoning of certain facilities, the downsizing of our presence in select markets and the contribution of our North American onshore pressure pumping business to BJ Services, LLC. There can be no assurance that our restructuring activities will produce the cost savings we anticipate in the expected timeframe or that the cumulative restructuring activities and charge will not have to increase in order to achieve our cost savings targets. Any delay or failure to achieve the expected cost savings and any increase in our anticipated cumulative restructuring activities and charge would likely cause our future earnings to be lower than anticipated.\nThe BJ Services, LLC venture may not achieve the results we expect and could result in a loss of our investment in the North America onshore pressure pumping business.\nThe Company will no longer control its North America onshore pressure pumping business and must rely on the management of BJ Services, LLC to operate that business. Poor performance or additional government regulation of that business could result in lower profitability than expected and could ultimately result in a loss of the investment the Company has in the business through its ownership of the LLC. This investment, and the related earnings, will be excluded from our North America segment.\nRisk Factors Related to the GE Transaction\nOur expectations regarding our business may be impacted by the following risk factors related to the pending GE Transaction:\nThe pendency of the GE Transaction could adversely affect our business.\nIn connection with the GE Transaction, some of our suppliers and customers may delay or defer sales and purchasing decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the GE Transaction is completed. We have agreed in the Transaction Agreement to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to our business and financial affairs during the pendency of the GE Transaction, which restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if completion of the GE Transaction is delayed and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business before completion of the GE Transaction or termination of the Transaction Agreement. The process of seeking to accomplish the GE Transaction could also divert the focus of our management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us.\nThe pursuit of the GE Transaction and the preparation for the integration of Baker Hughes and GE O&G have placed, and will continue to place, a significant burden on our management and internal resources. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of seeking to close the GE Transaction and integrate Baker Hughes and GE O&G, which could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our existing business, regardless of whether the GE Transaction is eventually completed. Our management team will be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing businesses, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products, services or strategies. One potential consequence of such distractions could be the failure of management to realize other opportunities that could be beneficial to us. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the process leading up to and immediately following Closing, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, the business of Baker Hughes could suffer.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees during the pendency of the GE Transaction.\nIn connection with the GE Transaction, current and prospective employees of Baker Hughes may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Baker Hughes, a GE Company following the GE Transaction (\"New Baker Hughes\"), which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the GE Transaction. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with New Baker Hughes following the Transaction. The departure of existing key employees or the failure of potential key employees to accept employment with New Baker Hughes, despite our recruiting efforts, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results, regardless of whether the GE Transaction is eventually completed.\nThe GE Transaction may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all, and failure to complete the GE Transaction may result in material adverse consequences to our business and operations.\nThe GE Transaction is subject to several closing conditions, including the adoption of the Transaction Agreement by our stockholders, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \"HSR Act\") and the receipt of regulatory approvals in certain other jurisdictions. The closing conditions also include the delivery by GE to us of the audited financial statements of GE O&G and the absence of differences between such audited financial statements and the unaudited financial statements of GE O&G that were delivered by GE to us prior to the date of the Transaction Agreement that are material to the intrinsic value of GE O&G (as determined in a manner consistent with appropriate valuation methodologies), excluding changes in goodwill and certain other exclusions. If any one of these conditions is not satisfied or waived, the GE Transaction may not be completed. There is no assurance that the GE Transaction will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\nThe parties have not yet obtained all regulatory clearances, consents and approvals required to complete the GE Transaction. Governmental or regulatory agencies could still seek to block or challenge the GE Transaction or\ncould impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the GE Transaction. These restrictions could include a requirement to sell certain specified businesses that GE is obligated under the terms of the Transaction Agreement to divest if necessary to obtain such regulatory approvals. If these approvals are not received, then neither we nor GE will be obligated to complete the GE Transaction. If the approvals could be received, but the applicable regulatory agency is not satisfied that a qualified buyer has been found or imposes on a party any antitrust action that would have an effect exceeding $200 million in revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 (other than with respect to the divestiture of certain specified businesses, which are not subject to the preceding limitations), GE would not be required to agree to undertake such actions and neither we nor GE would be obligated to complete the GE Transaction.\nIf our stockholders do not approve and adopt the Transaction Agreement or if the GE Transaction is not completed for any other reason, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may have been diverted to the GE Transaction instead of on our operations and pursuit of other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nresulting negative customer perception could adversely affect our ability to compete for, or to win, new and renewal business in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nwe and our stockholders would not realize the anticipated benefits of the GE Transaction, including a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share of Newco Class A Common Stock and any anticipated synergies from combining our business with GE O&G;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay a termination fee of $750 million if the Transaction Agreement is terminated in the case of certain events described in the Transaction Agreement, including due to an adverse change in our board of directors' recommendation to our stockholders to approve the GE Transaction;\n\u2022\nthe trading price of our common stock may experience increased volatility to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the GE Transaction will be completed; or\n\u2022\nthe Company could be subject to litigation from shareholders related to the Transaction Agreement.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.\nEven if the GE Transaction is closed, the integration of Baker Hughes and GE O&G following the Closing will present significant challenges that may result in a decline in the anticipated benefits of the GE Transaction.\nThe GE Transaction involves the combination of two businesses that currently operate as independent businesses. New Baker Hughes will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the GE Transaction, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. Potential difficulties New Baker Hughes may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate the two businesses, including operations, technologies, products and services, in a manner that permits New Baker Hughes to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the GE Transaction, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the GE Transaction not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nlost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two businesses deciding not to do business with New Baker Hughes, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;\n\u2022\nthe necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the GE Transaction;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and business cultures, while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;\n\u2022\nconsolidating and rationalizing information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures as well as accounting systems and related financial reporting activities;\n\u2022\npreserving important relationships of both Baker Hughes and GE O&G and resolving potential conflicts that may arise; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of Baker Hughes and GE O&G as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the GE Transaction and integrating the two businesses' operations.\nThe Transaction Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us.\nThe Transaction Agreement contains provisions that may discourage third parties from submitting business combination proposals to us that might result in greater value to our stockholders than the GE Transaction. The Transaction Agreement generally prohibits us from soliciting any competing acquisition proposal. In addition, if the Transaction Agreement is terminated by us or GE in circumstances that obligates us to pay a termination fee and to reimburse transaction expenses to GE, our financial condition may be adversely affected as a result of the payment of the termination fee and transaction expenses, which might deter third parties from proposing alternative business combination proposals.", "PERMNO": 75034, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "BHI"}
