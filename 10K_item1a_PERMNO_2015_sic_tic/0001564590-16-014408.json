Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business, including the Development, Regulatory Approval and Potential Commercialization of our Product Candidate, EVK-001\nOur business is entirely dependent on the success of a single product candidate, EVK-001, for which we are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, EVK-001.\nWe have only one product candidate: EVK-001, a metoclopramide nasal spray to treat female patients with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis. We are entirely dependent on successful continued development and regulatory approval of this product candidate for our future business success. We have invested, and will continue to invest, a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of EVK-001. We will need to successfully enroll and complete our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of EVK-001, which we commenced in April 2014, and, if required, raise sufficient funds for the completion of this trial. The future regulatory and commercial success of this product candidate is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe may not have sufficient financial and other resources to complete the Phase 3 clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy for EVK-001;\n\u25cf\nthe results of our planned and ongoing clinical trials may not confirm the positive results of earlier clinical trials, particularly because we are utilizing a modified patient report outcomes, or PRO, instrument for our current Phase 3 clinical trial compared to our Phase 2b clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA may disagree with the design of current and future clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nvariability in subjects, adjustments to clinical trial procedures and inclusion of additional clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf\nthe results of our clinical trial may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA for marketing approval;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to undertake additional clinical trials and other studies of EVK-001 before we can submit an NDA, to the FDA or receive approval of the NDA;\n\u25cf\nsubjects in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to EVK-001, such as dysgeusia, headache, diarrhea, nasal discomfort, tremor, myoclonus, somnolence, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, and fatigue;\n\u25cf\nif approved, EVK-001 will compete with well-established products already approved for marketing by the FDA, including oral and intravenous forms of metoclopramide, the same active ingredient in the nasal spray for EVK-001;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to obtain and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers or establish commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities.\nOf the large number of drugs in development in this industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market EVK-001, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.\nWe will require substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to suspend our Phase 3 clinical trial and otherwise delay, reduce or eliminate our development program for EVK-001.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. To date, our operations have been primarily financed through the proceeds from the sale of our common and preferred stock, and borrowings under our loan and financing agreements. We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our operations through October 2016, which includes the reporting of Phase 3 trial date, although there can be no assurance in that regard. As of February 29, 2016, we had randomized 186 subjects in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial with female subjects. We anticipate fully enrolling this trial during the second quarter of 2016. If the Phase 3 trial is not enrolled on our expected timeframe, we may need to raise additional funds to complete this trial. We may also need to raise additional funds to finance any\nadditional development requirements requested by the FDA, as well as for NDA preparation and pre-commercial activities, including marketing and manufacturing of EVK-001.\nOur estimates of the amount of cash necessary to fund our activities may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe rate of progress and cost of our Phase 3 clinical trial and any other clinical requirements for EVK-001;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of regulatory approval, if granted, of EVK-001 or any other product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with EVK-001;\n\u25cf\nthe costs and timing of completion of outsourced commercial manufacturing supply arrangements for EVK-001;\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u25cf\nthe terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish.\nThe results observed in female subjects with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in our Phase 2b clinical trial of EVK-001 may not be predictive of the safety and efficacy results in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage development. We commenced our Phase 3 clinical trial in female subjects with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in April 2014. Our Phase 2b clinical trial of EVK-001 for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis showed statistically significant improvement in clinically meaningful endpoints in female subjects. This was a pre-specified analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint performed on a gender subgroup of the intent to treat, or ITT, population. Due to a large placebo response in male subjects, EVK-001 did not achieve the primary endpoint in the ITT population for all subjects in this Phase 2b clinical trial.\nThis risk may be particularly significant for us because the primary endpoint in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial is not identical to the primary endpoint used in our Phase 2b trial. In our Phase 2b clinical trial, the primary endpoint was the GCSI-DD, a PRO instrument. The GCSI-DD is a composite of clinically relevant diabetic gastroparesis symptoms which patients rate according to severity. Based on our discussions with the FDA, the primary endpoint for our Phase 3 trial will be the GSA, which is a PRO instrument derived from the GCSI-DD. We have analyzed our Phase 2b data utilizing the GSA\u2019s methodology. Although we observed statistically significant and nearly identical statistical improvement in the GSA compared to the GCSI-DD in females in our Phase 2b trial, we cannot assure you that our Phase 3 trials will achieve positive results.\nA number of factors could contribute to a lack of favorable safety and efficacy results in our ongoing Phase 3 trial. For example:\n\u25cf\na multicenter trial could result in increased variability due to varying site characteristics, such as local standards of care;\n\u25cf\na multicenter trial could result in increased variability due to varying patient characteristics including demographic factors, health status, underlying reason for disease state and concomitant medications; and\n\u25cf\ndiagnosis of diabetic gastroparesis by physicians, including use of gastric emptying tests, could select for a patient population that differs from those patients included within previous clinical trials.\nIf we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for EVK-001, we will not be able to commercialize this product candidate and our ability to generate revenue will be limited.\nWe have not submitted an NDA or received regulatory approval to market any product candidates in any jurisdiction. We are not permitted to market EVK-001 in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for the product candidate in a particular indication from the FDA. To date, we have completed one Phase 2b clinical trial for EVK-001 in diabetic subjects with gastroparesis and acquired the results from a separate Phase 2 clinical trial in diabetic subjects with gastroparesis. In the Phase 2b clinical trial that we performed ourselves, which concluded in 2011, EVK-001 failed to meet the primary endpoint for the trial. Although an overall improvement in symptoms was observed in EVK-001-treated subjects with diabetic gastroparesis compared to placebo in this Phase 2b clinical trial, the difference was not statistically significant due to a high placebo response among male subjects. The earlier Phase 2 clinical trial performed by Questcor was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel design study. This head-to-head study compared the efficacy and safety of two doses of metoclopramide nasal spray, 10 mg and 20 mg, with the FDA-approved 10 mg metoclopramide tablet. Although data from the earlier Phase 2 clinical trial will be referenced in the EVK-001 NDA, the open-label study design limits the importance of the efficacy results in the NDA.\nWe commenced our Phase 3 clinical trial in female subjects with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in April 2014. There is no guarantee that this Phase 3 clinical trial or any other future trials will be successful or that regulators will agree with our assessment of the clinical trials for EVK-001 conducted to date. In addition, we have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on consultants and third party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. The FDA and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional clinical trials, or preclinical or other studies.\nVarying interpretation of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Furthermore, we have acquired our rights to EVK-001 from Questcor, who acquired its rights from a predecessor. Thus, much of the preclinical and a portion of the clinical data relating to EVK-001 that we would expect to submit in an NDA for EVK-001 was obtained from studies conducted before we owned the rights to the product candidate and, accordingly, was prepared and managed by others. These predecessors may not have applied the same resources and given the same attention to this development program as we would have if we had been in control from inception.\nEVK-001 and the activities associated with its development and potential commercialization, including its testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain regulatory marketing approval for EVK-001 will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nThe FDA may impose requirements on our clinical trials that are difficult to comply with, which could harm our business.\nThe requirements that the FDA may impose on clinical trials for EVK-001 are uncertain. However, in July 2015 the FDA published draft guidance intended to assist sponsors in the clinical development of drugs for the treatment of diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis clinical trials, Gastroparesis: Clinical Evaluation of Drugs for Treatment - Guidance for Industry. We believe that the FDA Guidance is consistent with the advice the FDA provided to us regarding trial design and study endpoints for our ongoing Phase 3 trials. As a result, our Phase 3 protocol is consistent with the specific recommendations in the FDA Guidance. In addition, the FDA Guidance explicitly states that there is an urgent medical need for development of drugs with a favorable risk-benefit profile to treat patients with gastroparesis and acknowledges that \u201cpatients with diabetic gastroparesis may experience further derangement of glucose control because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally administered hypoglycemic drugs.\u201d\nWe are conducting one Phase 3 trial in adult female subjects with diabetic gastroparesis, which, along with the completed thorough ECG (QT) trial, we believe will be sufficient for NDA submission seeking an indication of treatment of symptoms associated with diabetic gastroparesis in women. In April 2014, we commenced a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and population pharmacokinetics of EVK-001 in adult female subjects with diabetic gastroparesis when dosed four times a day for 28 days. Although we believe successful results from this single Phase 3 clinical trial, along with the thorough ECG (QT) trial, will be sufficient to allow us to submit an NDA for EVK-001, it is possible the FDA will require additional clinical testing before submission or approval of the NDA. In addition, based on discussions with the FDA, we also are conducting a similar study for safety and efficacy in adult male subjects with diabetic gastroparesis which is not required for an NDA submission. If we are unable to comply with the FDA\u2019s requirements, we will not be able to obtain approval for EVK-001 and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the enrollment or completion of, our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nDelays in the enrollment or completion of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for EVK-001 could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether this trial will complete enrollment or produce data on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u25cf\nthe FDA placing the clinical trial on hold;\n\u25cf\nsubjects failing to enroll or remain in our trial at the rate we expect (for example, due to variable patient frequency and severity of disease and variability in gastric emptying testing);\n\u25cf\nsubjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indication for which we are developing EVK-001, or participating in competing clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nsubjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u25cf\na facility manufacturing EVK-001 or any of its components being ordered by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of product candidate in the manufacturing process;\n\u25cf\nany changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u25cf\nthird-party clinical investigators losing their license or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, GCP and regulatory requirements, or other third parties not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u25cf\ninspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA or the finding of regulatory violations by the FDA or an IRB that require us to undertake corrective action, result in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire trial, or that prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u25cf\nthird-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or any of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications; or\n\u25cf\none or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing its approval of the trial.\nProduct development costs will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of EVK-001, or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical trial sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Also, if one or more clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of EVK-001 could be significantly reduced.\nThe Phase 3 trial is expected to enroll approximately 200 female subjects at sites across the United States. Many of the clinical trial sites with previous gastroparesis study experience have experienced slower than previously anticipated enrollment. Although the trial sites have been screening significant numbers of subjects with diabetic gastroparesis, these subjects typically have symptoms that vary in timing and severity, unpredictable gastric emptying delays, and complex medical histories, making study enrollment challenging. We are also facing competition for subjects from other ongoing competing clinical trials that were not active when we started our Phase 3 trial. This combination of factors creates a challenge for enrollment into diabetic gastroparesis trials, though we continue to anticipate fully enrolling this trial during the second quarter of 2016. Continued delays in the enrollment and completion of the Phase 3 trial, as well as potential delays in any other clinical trials and studies, could be harmful to our business and cause us to require additional funding sooner than anticipated.\nFinal marketing approval for EVK-001 by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for commercial use may be delayed, limited, or denied, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nAfter the completion of our Phase 3 clinical trial and, assuming the results of the trial are successful, the submission of an NDA, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize EVK-001 and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue. Because EVK-001 is our only product candidate this risk is particularly significant for us. We cannot commercialize EVK-001 until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved marketing applications for this product candidate. We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for EVK-001. In addition, we may experience delays or the application may be rejected based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. For example, in 2009 following an FDA review of metoclopramide spontaneous safety reports, the FDA required a boxed warning be added to the metoclopramide product label concerning the chance of tardive dyskinesia, or TD, for patients taking these products. The FDA requires a boxed warning (sometimes referred to as a \u201cBlack Box\u201d Warning) for products that have shown a significant risk of severe or life-threatening adverse events. Recently, the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, has reviewed and has proposed labeling changes for marketed metoclopramide products in the European Union based on age, dosing guidelines or indications. Based on their assessment of the limited efficacy and safety data currently available to the CHMP, the CHMP recommended to the European Medicines Agency that indications with limited or inconclusive efficacy data, including GERD, dyspepsia and gastroparesis, be removed from the approved product label in the European Union. There can be no assurance as to whether the FDA will re-review approved metoclopramide product labels as a result of any such regulatory actions in the European Union or otherwise. If marketing approval for EVK-001 is delayed, limited or denied, our ability to market the product candidate, and our ability to generate product sales, would be adversely affected.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that EVK-001 satisfies the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for our primary product candidate will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\nWe intend to seek FDA approval through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our primary product candidate, EVK-001. EVK-001 is a drug/device combination product that will be regulated under the drug provisions of the FFDCA, enabling us to submit an NDA for its approval. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.\nIf the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for EVK-001, and the complications and risks associated with our lead product candidate, would likely substantially increase. We may need to obtain additional funding, which could result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in competitive products reaching the market before EVK-001, which could impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that EVK-001 or any future product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for EVK-001, it could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidate, when and if EVK-001 is approved.\nEven if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on EVK-001\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time consuming post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or clinical trials. EVK-001 will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requesting recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we or the manufacturing facilities for EVK-001 fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u25cf\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cf\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u25cf\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements or applications filed by us;\n\u25cf\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u25cf\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of product, or request us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nThe FDA has the authority to require a REMS as a condition of approval of an NDA or following approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. In March 2009, the FDA informed drug manufacturers that it will require a REMS for metoclopramide drug products, including a Medication Guide, elements to assure safe use (including an education program for prescribers and materials for prescribers to educate patients), and a timetable for submission of assessments of at least six months, 12 months, and annually after the REMS is approved. We intend to submit a proposed REMS at the time of the NDA submission for EVK-001.\nIn addition, if EVK-001 is approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for EVK-001, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for EVK-001, we still may not be able to successfully commercialize it and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, will be limited.\nEVK-001\u2019s commercial success will depend upon the acceptance of the product candidate by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidate will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndemonstration of clinical efficacy and safety compared to other more-established products;\n\u25cf\nthe limitation of our targeted patient population to women-only;\n\u25cf\nlimitations or warnings contained in any FDA-approved labeling, including the potential boxed warning on all metoclopramide product labels concerning the chance of TD for patients taking these products, or any limitations with respect to metoclopramide product labels in the European Union;\n\u25cf\nacceptance of a new formulation by health care providers and their patients;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u25cf\nnew procedures or methods of treatment that may be more effective in treating or may reduce the incidences of diabetic gastroparesis;\n\u25cf\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors; and\n\u25cf\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.\nIf EVK-001 is approved, but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of EVK-001 may require significant resources and may never be successful. In addition, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidate will depend on our ability to manufacture our products, differentiate our products from competing products and defend the intellectual property of our products.\nIt will be difficult for us to profitably sell EVK-001 if coverage and reimbursement are limited.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidate will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors have been challenging the prices charged for products. They may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted marketing approval. This trend may impact the reimbursement for treatments for GI disorders especially, including EVK-001, as physicians typically focus on symptoms rather than underlying conditions when treating patients with these disorders and drugs are often prescribed for uses outside of their approved indications. In instances where alternative products are available, it may be required that those alternative treatment options are tried before coverage and reimbursement are available for EVK-001. Although EVK-001 is a novel nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide, this is the same active ingredient that is already available in other formulations approved for the treatment of gastroparesis that are already widely available at generic prices. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for EVK-001 and, if coverage is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, this product candidate. In addition, in certain foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental\ncontrol. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidate.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for many of our activities, including clinical development and supply of EVK-001.\nWe have only seven full-time employees and, as a result, we rely on outsourcing arrangements for a significant portion of our activities, including clinical research, data collection and analysis and manufacturing, as well as functioning as a public company. We may have limited control over these third parties and we cannot guarantee that they will perform their obligations in an effective and timely manner.\nWe have retained SynteractHCR, a contract research organization, or CRO, to conduct our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of EVK-001. We rely on our CRO to recruit suitable subjects to participate in the trial at each trial site. Enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical trial of EVK-001 has progressed more slowly than anticipated, and although we have undertaken additional initiatives to increase enrollment and to further assist clinical trial sites in the identification of eligible study subjects, our CRO is ultimately responsible for recruitment efforts.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any component of EVK-001, including metoclopramide, the nasal spray device or associated bottle, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials. For EVK-001, we are currently using, and relying on, single suppliers and single manufacturers for starting materials, the final drug substance and nasal spray delivery device. Although potential alternative suppliers and manufacturers for some components have been identified, we have not qualified these vendors to date. If we were required to change vendors, it could result in a failure to meet regulatory requirements or projected timelines and necessary quality standards for successful manufacturing of the various required lots of material for our development and commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of EVK-001. If EVK-001 is approved for sale by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for commercial production. The number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture bulk drug substance on a commercial scale is limited. We have identified one manufacturer for potentially providing commercial supplies of EVK-001; however, no alternative providers have been identified to date. If we are unable to come to terms on becoming our commercial supplier with this manufacturer, we would have to find replacements, which could delay the commercialization of our product candidate.\nIn addition, our reliance on third party CROs and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, entails further risks including:\n\u25cf\nnon-compliance by third parties with regulatory and quality control standards;\n\u25cf\nbreach by third parties of our agreements with them;\n\u25cf\ntermination or non-renewal of an agreement with third parties; and\n\u25cf\nsanctions imposed by regulatory authorities if compounds supplied or manufactured by a third party supplier or manufacturer fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others selling their products more effectively than we do, and in others discovering, developing or commercializing product candidates before, or more successfully, than we do.\nOur future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of EVK-001. We anticipate that EVK-001, if approved, would compete directly with metoclopramide, erythromycin and domperidone, each of which is available under various trade names sold by several major pharmaceutical companies, including generic manufacturers. Metoclopramide is the only molecule currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis. Metoclopramide is generically-available and indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis, without the limitation of use in women only.\nMany of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. We will not be able to compete successfully unless we successfully:\n\u25cf\nassure health care providers, patients and health care payors that EVK-001 is beneficial compared to other products in the market;\n\u25cf\nobtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for EVK-001;\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain required regulatory approvals for EVK-001; and\n\u25cf\ncollaborate with others to effectively market, sell and distribute EVK-001.\nEstablished competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidate obsolete. In addition to our EVK-001 product candidate, we are aware of other development candidates in clinical development. Any of these product candidates could advance through clinical development faster than EVK-001 and, if approved, could attain faster and greater market acceptance than our product candidate. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nWe have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities currently and we will have to invest significant resources to develop these capabilities.\nCurrently, we have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If EVK-001 ultimately receives regulatory approval, we may not be able to effectively market and distribute the product candidate. We will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources to develop internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that EVK-001 will be approved. We may not be able to hire consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing and distribution functions on acceptable financial terms or at all. Even if we determine to perform sales, marketing and distribution functions ourselves, we could face a number of additional related risks, including:\n\u25cf\ninability to attract and build an effective marketing department or sales force;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of establishing a marketing department or sales force may exceed our available financial resources and the revenues generated by EVK-001 or any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire; and\n\u25cf\nour direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key commercial personnel, we may be unable to successfully complete the development of EVK-001 and commercialize this product candidate.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and commercial personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management team composed of three individuals: David A. Gonyer, R.Ph., our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew J. D\u2019Onofrio, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, and Marilyn Carlson, D.M.D., M.D., our Chief Medical Officer. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of EVK-001 or the commercialization of this product candidate, if approved.\nWe will need to hire and retain qualified personnel. We could experience problems in the future attracting and retaining qualified employees. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense, particularly in the San Diego, California area where we are headquartered. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms who have the expertise we need to sustain and grow our business.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nBecause we currently have only seven full-time employees, we will need to grow our organization substantially to pursue the potential commercialization of EVK-001 and to potentially conduct additional development activities. As we seek to advance EVK-001, we will need to expand our regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management and require us to retain additional internal capabilities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize EVK-001 and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, clinical and regulatory, financial, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize EVK-001 and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for EVK-001, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidate, assuming we obtain marketing approval.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of EVK-001, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient drug purchases by Medicare beneficiaries under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in Medicare reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn early 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, increased the Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for both branded and generic drugs and revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could further increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, increased the number of entities eligible for discounts under the 340B program and included a 50% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole.\u201d Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. Although it is too early to determine the full effect of the Affordable Care Act, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. These new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products, if approved.\nIf we market products in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, or if we violate government price reporting laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include false claims, anti-kickback and physician payment transparency laws and regulations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare\nitem or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Further, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal healthcare fraud statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Over the past few years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act included the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report such data to the government by the 90th calendar day of each year. There are also several states with similar laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and/or require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nFederal legislation and actions by state and local governments may permit re-importation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and our overall financial condition.\nWe may face competition in the United States for EVK-001, if approved, from lower priced products from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. This risk may be particularly applicable to drugs such as EVK-001. The MMA contains provisions that may change U.S. importation laws and expand pharmacists\u2019 and wholesalers\u2019 ability to import lower priced versions of an approved drug and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. These changes to U.S. importation laws will not take effect unless and until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public\u2019s health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has not yet announced any plans to make this required certification.\nA number of federal legislative proposals have been made to implement the changes to the U.S. importation laws without any certification and to broaden permissible imports in other ways. Even if the changes do not take effect, and other changes are not enacted, imports from Canada and elsewhere may continue to increase due to market and political forces, and the limited enforcement resources of the FDA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other government agencies. For example, Pub. L. No. 111-83, which was signed into law in October 2009 and provides appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the 2010 fiscal year, expressly prohibits U.S. Customs and Border Protection from using funds to prevent individuals from importing from Canada less\nthan a 90-day supply of a prescription drug for personal use, when the drug otherwise complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Further, several states and local governments have implemented importation schemes for their citizens and, in the absence of federal action to curtail such activities, we expect other states and local governments to launch importation efforts.\nThe importation of foreign products that compete with EVK-001 could negatively impact our revenue and profitability, possibly materially.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of EVK-001.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of EVK-001 and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize the product candidate. For example, we may be sued if EVK-001 allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.\nIn particular, products containing metoclopramide have been reported to cause side effects, including TD. It is possible that a patient taking EVK-001 will be found to experience a variety of side effects. In 2009, the FDA required a boxed warning on all metoclopramide product labels concerning the chance of TD for patients taking these products. We expect that the label for EVK-001, if approved, will likely contain a similar warning regarding TD. Several manufactures of metoclopramide products have been sued by patients regarding TD.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidate. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for EVK-001;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf\nloss of revenue;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to commercialize EVK-001; and\n\u25cf\na decline in our stock price.\nWe may form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances.\nWe may form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, including for the continued development or commercialization of EVK-001. These relationships or those like them may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for EVK-001 because third parties may view the risk of success in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial as too significant or the commercial opportunity for our product candidate as too limited. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies such transaction.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors and consultants and collaborators are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development program for EVK-001 and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to\nrecover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture EVK-001 and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidate could be delayed.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our EVK-001. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of EVK-001 could be disrupted, if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. Our operations are located in Solana Beach, California near major earthquake faults and fire zones. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and fire zones and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster.\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we plan to evaluate the development and/or commercialization of other therapies for GI motility disorders. Similar to our initial focus on gastroparesis, we will evaluate opportunities to in-license or acquire other product candidates as well as commercial products to treat patients suffering from predominantly GI disorders, seeking to identify areas of high unmet medical needs with limited treatment options. These other product candidates will require additional, time-consuming development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, extensive clinical trials and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the drug candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and/or effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace or be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nIf we engage in an acquisition, reorganization or business combination, we will incur a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business operations or our stockholders.\nFrom time to time we have considered, and we will continue to consider in the future, strategic business initiatives intended to further the development of our business. These initiatives may include acquiring businesses, technologies or products or entering into a business combination with another company. If we do pursue such a strategy, we could, among other things:\n\u25cf\nissue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u25cf\nincur substantial debt that may place strains on our operations;\n\u25cf\nspend substantial operational, financial and management resources in integrating new businesses, technologies and products; and\n\u25cf\nassume substantial actual or contingent liabilities.\nWe may be unable to maintain sufficient product liability insurance.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical studies. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage due to the commercial launch of any product, we may be unable to obtain such increased coverage on acceptable terms or at all. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights would materially affect our business.\nWe place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection for new technologies, products and processes because our commercial success will depend, in large part, on obtaining patent protection for new technologies, products and processes, successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing our patents against third party competitors. To that end, we have acquired and will file applications for patents covering formulations containing or uses of EVK-001 or our proprietary processes as well as other intellectual property important to our business. One of our patents related to EVK-001 was acquired from Questcor. This method of use patent was not written by us or our attorneys, and we did not have control over the drafting and prosecution of these patents. Further, Questcor and other predecessors might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of these patents and applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the patent and application and had control over the drafting and prosecution.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unresolved. In recent years patent rights have been the subject of significant litigation, in particular due to inter partes review, introduced by the America Invents Act of 2012, which allows for quicker patent challenges decided by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board rather than a lay jury. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our predecessors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our predecessors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions One or more of these factors could possibly result in findings of invalidity or unenforceability of one or more of the patents we own.\nThe patent rights we own covering EVK-001 are limited to specific methods of use and formulations of metoclopramide. As a result, our ability to market EVK-001 may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredient itself and other metoclopramide formulations may be developed by competitors. The active ingredient in EVK-001 is metoclopramide. No patent protection is available for metoclopramide itself. As a result, competitors who develop and receive required regulatory approval for competing products using the same active ingredient as EVK-001 may market their competing products so long as they do not infringe any of the method or formulation patents owned by us.\nOthers have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar, identical or competitive to ours, or important to our business. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications filed or in-licensed by us, or that we will not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before U.S. or foreign patent offices.\nWe have focused our intellectual property efforts on the United States. To the extent that our patent portfolio differs from country to country outside the United States, this may make protecting EVK-001 as a product outside the United States even more difficult and unpredictable. Various countries maintain their own standards and interpretation of intellectual property law, potentially creating additional patent risk beyond even that experienced within the United States.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we require employees, consultants and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. Our research collaborators and scientific advisors may have rights to publish data and information in which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborators and advisors, our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be imperiled.\nClaims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nThe biotechnology industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of EVK-001. In addition, identification of third party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time\nconsuming and could likely:\n\u25cf\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u25cf\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u25cf\ncause development delays;\n\u25cf\nprevent us from commercializing EVK-001 until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u25cf\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of infringement against us, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent EVK-001 from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our product candidate or processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and could require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market EVK-001, or, if no such license were available on commercially viable terms, could require us to cease manufacturing and marketing of EVK-001. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign our product candidate or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing EVK-001, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Whatever the outcome, any patent litigation would be costly and time consuming, could be distracting to our management, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ and consult with individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or consultants are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers or clients (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees, our consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nOur recurring losses from operations have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and as a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to this uncertainty. This going concern opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of new debt or equity securities or otherwise. Future reports on our financial statements may also include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and have never been profitable, and it is possible we will never achieve profitability. We have devoted our resources to developing our product candidate, but it cannot be marketed until regulatory approvals have been obtained. Based upon our currently expected level of operating expenditures, we expect to be able to fund our operations through October 2016. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in planned spending on our EVK-001 development program or more rapid progress of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial than anticipated. There is no assurance that other financing will be available when needed to allow us to continue as a going concern. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since we were founded in 2007 and expect to incur significant losses for the next several years related to completing our Phase 3 clinical trial for EVK-001, and seeking regulatory approval from the FDA to manufacture and commercialize EVK-001. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, was approximately $12.1 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $48.1 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials, research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses, especially since we became a public company in September 2013. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, clinical testing,\nregulatory compliance activities and, if EVK-001 is approved, sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in our incurring further significant losses for the next several years.\nWe currently generate no revenue from sales, and we may never be able to commercialize EVK-001 or other marketable drugs. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will ever generate revenues or achieve profitability, which could impair our ability to sustain operations or obtain any required additional funding. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize EVK-001.\nWe will require substantial additional future capital in order to finance additional development requirements requested by the FDA, as well as for NDA preparation and pre-commercial activities, including marketing and manufacturing of EVK-001. The amount and timing of any expenditure needed to implement our development and commercialization programs will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe progress, costs, results of and timing of our clinical development program for EVK-001, including our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nthe need for, and the progress, costs and results of, any additional clinical trials of EVK-001 we may initiate based on the results of our planned and ongoing clinical trials or discussions with the FDA, including any additional trials the FDA or other regulatory agencies may require evaluating the safety of EVK-001;\n\u25cf\nthe outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA, and any similar regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and costs associated with manufacturing EVK-001 for clinical trials and other studies and, if approved, for commercial sale;\n\u25cf\nour need and ability to hire additional management, development and scientific personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe cost to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and costs associated with establishing sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of EVK-001;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our Mallinckrodt asset purchase agreement and the timing of such payments;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies; and\n\u25cf\nour need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.\nSome of these factors are outside of our control. We cannot provide any assurance that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of our Phase 3 clinical trial and remaining development program, and, in any event, we will need to raise additional capital to submit marketing applications for and prepare for commercialization of EVK-001 should we receive product approval. We may need to raise additional funds in the near future to complete development activities for EVK-001.\nWe may seek additional funding through collaboration agreements and public or private financings. For example, in November 2014 we entered into a sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with MLV & Co. LLC, or MLV, pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, at our option, up to an aggregate of $6.6 million of shares of our common stock through MLV, as sales agent. During September 2015, FBR & Co., or FBR, acquired MLV and assumed its rights and obligations under the Sales Agreement. Sales of our common stock made pursuant to the Sales Agreement are made on The NASDAQ Capital Market under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on November 13, 2014, which was declared effective by the SEC on November 25, 2014, by means of ordinary brokers\u2019 transactions at market prices. Although sales of our common stock have taken place pursuant to the Sales Agreement, there can be no assurance that FBR will be successful in consummating future sales based on prevailing market conditions or in the quantities or at the prices that we deem appropriate. Under current SEC regulations, at any time during which the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, is less than $75.0 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration statements, including sales under the Sales Agreement, is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. As of February 29, 2016, our public float was 4.1 million shares, the value of which was $14.6 million based upon the closing price of our common stock of $3.57 on February 22, 2016. The value of one-third of our public float calculated on the same basis was $4.8 million. We are unable to sell any further shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement due to current capacity restrictions. Furthermore, FBR is permitted to terminate the Sales Agreement\nin its sole discretion upon ten days\u2019 notice, or at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of an event that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, operations, earnings, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, stockholders\u2019 equity or results of operations.\nAdditional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. In addition, the issuance of additional shares by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline and dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, if required, we will be unable to complete the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for EVK-001 and may be required to significantly curtail all of our activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our product candidate or some of our technologies or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nThe terms of our secured debt facility require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.\nWe have a $4.5 million loan and security agreement with Square 1 Bank, a division of Pacific Western Bank, or Square 1, that is secured by a lien covering substantially all of our personal property, excluding intellectual property. On December 31, 2014, we drew the entire $4.5 million line. The credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and any subsidiaries we create in the future. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage and meet certain covenants with respect to enrollment and results of our Phase 3 trial for EVK-001. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens and selling assets, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The credit facility also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which provide Square 1 with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the term loans under the credit facility, including foreclosure against our properties securing the credit facilities, including our cash. These events of default include, among other things, our failure to pay any amounts due under the credit facility, a breach of covenants under the credit facility, our insolvency, a material adverse change, the occurrence of any default under certain other indebtedness in an amount greater than $400,000 and a final judgment against us in an amount greater than $400,000. Square 1 could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that they interpret as a material adverse change as defined under the loan agreement, thereby requiring us to repay the loan immediately or to attempt to reverse the declaration of default through negotiation or litigation. Any declaration by the lender of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we raise any additional debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and may be subject to further limitation as a result of the transactions completed in connection with our initial public offering.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. As a result of our initial public offering, our most recent private placement and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, we may have experienced an \u201cownership change.\u201d We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As of December 31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $43.9 million and $42.9 million, respectively, and federal research and development credits of approximately $1.5 million which could be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained.\nPrior to our initial public offering in September 2013, there was no public market for our common stock. An active trading market may never develop or be sustained. If an active trading market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock at a price that is desirable or at all. In addition, an inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business. Since the commencement of trading in connection with our initial public offering in September 2013 through February 29, 2016, the sale price per share of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market has ranged from a low of $2.37 to a high of $14.25.\nThe price of the shares of our common stock could be highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to enroll patients in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nresults of the clinical trial, and the results of trials of our competitors or those of other companies in our market sector;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems, especially in light of current reforms to the U.S. healthcare system;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u25cf\nsales of our stock by insiders and 5% stockholders;\n\u25cf\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our EVK-001 development program;\n\u25cf\naddition or termination of clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments affecting EVK-001; and\n\u25cf\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of February 29, 2016, our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, owned 43.2% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, such persons, acting together, will have the ability to control our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction. These persons will also have the ability to control our management and business affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover\nor other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u25cf\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf\npermitting our board of directors to accelerate the vesting of outstanding option grants upon certain transactions that result in a change of control; and\n\u25cf\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of our stockholders to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business. In addition, our loan and security agreement with Square 1 currently prohibits us from paying dividends on our equity securities, and any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nPersons who were our stockholders prior to the sale of shares in our initial public offering in September 2013 continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they are able to sell in the public market, subject in some cases to certain legal restrictions. Significant portions of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nAs of February 29, 2016, we had 7,201,774 shares of common stock outstanding. All of these shares are freely tradable without restriction in the public market, except for 3,112,527 shares that are held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAs of February 29, 2016, the holders of 2,590,564 shares of our common stock are entitled to reasonable best efforts registration rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. In addition, holders of 84,000 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants are also entitled to reasonable best efforts registration rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following 2013, the year in which we completed our initial public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market. These rules impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls, changes in corporate governance practices, proxy access and \u201csay on pay\u201d votes. As an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we are permitted to implement many of these requirements over a longer period of time. While we are taking advantage of this option to delay implementation, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 14158, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "EVOK"}
