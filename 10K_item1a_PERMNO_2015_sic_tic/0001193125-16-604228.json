{"cik": "5133", "company": "AMERICAN GREETINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties we describe below and all other information in this report. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Additional information on risk factors is included in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report.\nThere are factors outside of our control that may decrease the demand for our products and services, which may adversely affect our performance.\nOur success depends on the sustained demand for our products. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending on our products, including, among other things, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, weather, fuel prices and consumer confidence in future economic conditions, all of which are beyond our control. During periods of economic decline, when discretionary income is lower, consumers or potential consumers could delay, reduce or forego their purchases of our products and services, which reduces our sales. A prolonged economic downturn or slow economic recovery may also lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses.\nProviding new and compelling products is critical to our future profitability and cash flow.\nOne of our key business strategies has been to gain profitable market position through product leadership, providing relevant, compelling and superior product offerings. As a result, the need to continuously update and refresh our product offerings is an ongoing, evolving process requiring expenditures and investments that will continue to impact net sales, earnings and cash flows over future periods. At times, the amount and timing of such expenditures and investments depends on the success of a product offering as well as the schedules of our retail partners. We cannot assure you that this strategy will increase either our revenue or profitability. For example, we may not be able to anticipate or respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for greeting cards or shifts in consumer shopping behavior. If we misjudge the market, we may significantly sell or overstock unpopular products and be forced to grant significant credits, accept significant returns or write-off a significant amount of inventory, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flow. Conversely, shortages of popular items could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience volatility in our cash flow as a result of investments we may make over the next several years.\nWe have focused and expect to continue to focus our resources on our core greeting card business, developing new, and growing existing business, including by expanding Internet, mobile and other channels of electronic distribution to make American Greetings the natural and preferred social expressions solution, as well as by capturing any shifts in consumer demand. In addition, to the extent we are successful in expanding distribution and revenue in connection with expanding our market leadership, additional capital may be deployed as we may incur incremental costs associated with this expanded distribution, including upfront costs prior to any incremental revenue being generated. If incurred, these costs may be material. We also have been allocating, and expect to continue to allocate over roughly the next several years, resources, including capital, by modernizing our information technology systems, redesigning and deploying new processes, and evolving new organization structures, all of which are intended to drive efficiencies within the business and add new capabilities. The timing of when we spend these amounts may vary from year to year depending on the pacing of the project, but the amounts that we spend could be material in any fiscal year. We currently expect to spend at least an additional $195 million, the majority of which we expect will be capital expenditures. We believe these investments are important to our business, helping us drive further efficiencies and add new capabilities; however, there can be no assurance that we will not spend more or less than $195 million or that we will achieve the anticipated efficiencies or any cost savings.\nConsumers shifting to value shopping may negatively impact our profitability.\nOver the past several years, consumer shopping patterns have continued to evolve and that shift is impacting us. As consumers have been gradually shifting to value shopping, this shift is resulting in a change in mix of product sold to a higher proportion of value line cards that lowers the average price sold of our greeting cards and has an unfavorable impact on our gross margin percentage. We expect this trend to continue, which will put continued downward pressure on our historical gross margin percentage. Although we believe that we can mitigate some of the impact this trend may have on our gross margin percentage by continuing to focus on efficiency and cost reduction within all areas of the Corporation, we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our gross margin percentage will not decrease.\nWe rely on a few customers for a significant portion of our sales.\nA few of our customers are material to our business and operations. Net sales to our five largest customers, which include mass merchandisers, accounted for approximately 42% of total revenue in 2016, approximately 40% of total revenue in 2015 and approximately 39% of total revenue in 2014. Approximately 58% of the North American Social Expression Products segment\u2019s revenue in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014 was attributable to its top five customers. Approximately 59%, 54% and 50% of the International Social Expression Products segment\u2019s revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, excluding sales to the Retail Operations segment, was attributable to its top three customers. Net sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 15% of total revenue in 2016, and approximately 14% of total revenue in 2015 and 2014. Net sales to Target Corporation accounted for approximately 14% of total revenue in 2016, and approximately 13% of total revenue in each of 2015 and 2014. There can be no assurance that our large customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities that they have in the past. The loss of sales to one of our large customers could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nDifficulties in integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business and we may not achieve the cost savings and increased revenues anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.\nWe continue to regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support and strengthen our business. We cannot be sure that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates, acquire candidates on acceptable terms or integrate acquired businesses successfully. Future acquisitions could cause us to take on additional compliance obligations as well as incur debt, contingent liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIntegrating future businesses that we may acquire involves significant challenges. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of these acquired businesses has and will continue to require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day operations. The process of integrating operations may also cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of key personnel. Employee uncertainty and distraction during the integration process may also disrupt our business. Our strategy is, in part, predicated on our ability to realize cost savings and to increase revenues through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of our products and services. Achieving these cost savings and revenue increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, we may not be able to realize the benefits of anticipated integration of sales forces, asset rationalization, systems integration, and more comprehensive product and service offerings.\nIf Schurman Fine Papers is unable to operate its retail stores successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn April, 2009, we sold our then existing North American Retail Operations segment, including all 341 of our card and gift retail store assets, to Schurman Fine Papers (\u201cSchurman\u201d), which now operates stores under a number of brands, including the American Greetings, Carlton Cards and Papyrus brands. Although we do not control Schurman, because Schurman is licensing the \u201cPapyrus,\u201d \u201cAmerican Greetings\u201d and \u201cCarlton Cards\u201d names from us for its retail stores, actions taken by Schurman may be seen by the public as actions taken by us, which, in turn,\ncould adversely affect our reputation or brands. In addition, the failure of Schurman to operate its retail stores profitably could have a material adverse effect on us, our reputation and our brands, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, because, under the terms of the transaction:\n\u2022\nwe remain subject to certain store leases on a contingent basis through our subleasing of stores to Schurman (as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, as of February 29, 2016, Schurman\u2019s aggregate commitments to us under these subleases was approximately $2 million);\n\u2022\nwe are the predominant supplier of greeting cards and other social expression products to the retail stores operated by Schurman; and\n\u2022\nwe have provided credit support to Schurman, including a guaranty of up to $10 million in favor of the lenders under Schurman\u2019s senior revolving credit facility as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAs a result, if Schurman is unable to operate its retail stores profitably, we may incur significant costs if (1) Schurman is unable to pay for product that it has purchased from us, (2) Schurman is unable to pay rent and other amounts due with respect to the retail store leases that we have subleased to it, or (3) we become obligated under our guaranty of its indebtedness. Accordingly, we may decide in the future to provide Schurman with additional financial or operational support to assist Schurman in successfully operating its stores. Providing such support, however, could result in it being determined that we have a \u201ccontrolling financial interest\u201d in Schurman under the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s standards pertaining to the consolidation of a variable interest entity. For information regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. If it is determined that we have a controlling financial interest in Schurman, we will be required to consolidate Schurman\u2019s operations into our results, which could materially affect our reported results of operations and financial position as we would be required to include a portion of Schurman\u2019s income or losses and assets and liabilities into our financial statements.\nWe may not be successful in operating a direct retail business in a foreign country.\nIn connection with our June 2012 acquisition of assets from Clinton Cards and certain of its subsidiaries (\u201cClintons\u201d) out of bankruptcy administration, we acquired approximately 400 retail stores together with related inventory and overhead, as well as the Clinton Cards and related brands. We face a number of challenges in operating a retail business in a foreign country. For example, the specialty retail market in the United Kingdom is extremely competitive with some competitors being larger and more well-established. In addition, we have and continue to face challenges regarding the Clintons brand as a result of the negative perceptions, and loss of consumers, following the bankruptcy administration of Clintons. Additionally, we have been and may continue to be required to make capital and other investments in these stores, which could adversely affect their profitability. There are also many factors outside of our control that could adversely affect our ability to operate the Clintons retail stores profitably, including factors that may affect consumer spending on our products, such as negative consumer perception resulting from a United States company owning the Clintons stores, unfavorable economic conditions in the United Kingdom, availability of consumer credit, taxation levels, adverse weather, high fuel prices and low consumer confidence.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by retail consolidations.\nWith continued retail trade consolidations, we are increasingly dependent upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing. We may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to display space, SBT and other conditions. Increased consolidations in the retail industry could result in other changes that could damage our business, such as a loss of customers, decreases in volume, less favorable contractual terms and the growth of discount chains. In addition, as the bargaining strength of our retail customers grows, we may be required to grant greater credits, discounts, allowances and other incentive considerations to these customers. We may not be able to recover the costs of these incentives if the customer does not purchase a sufficient amount of products during the term of its agreement with us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBankruptcy of key customers could give rise to an inability to pay us and increase our exposure to losses from bad debts.\nMany of our largest customers are mass merchandiser retailers. The mass merchandiser retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years. In addition, the downturns in the economy and resulting decreasing consumer demand puts pressure on the retail industry in general, as well as specialty retailers specifically, including certain of the card and gift shops that we supply. As a result, retailers may experience liquidity problems and some may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. There is a risk that certain of our key customers will not pay us, will seek additional credit from us, or that payment may be delayed because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond our control, which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts and may require us to write-off deferred cost assets. Additionally, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if certain of our larger retail customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy, or significantly reduce the number of stores they operate.\nWe rely on foreign sources of production and face a variety of risks associated with doing business in foreign markets.\nWe rely on foreign manufacturers and suppliers for various products we distribute to customers. In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources. We generally do not have long-term supply contracts with foreign suppliers and some of our imports are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas. In addition, a portion of our current operations are conducted and located abroad. The success of our sales to, and operations in, foreign markets depends on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we sell our products. We also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:\n\u2022\npolitical instability, civil unrest and labor shortages;\n\u2022\nimposition of new legislation and customs regulations relating to imports that may limit the quantity and/or increase the cost of goods which may be imported into the United States from countries in a particular region;\n\u2022\nlack of effective product quality control procedures by foreign manufacturers and suppliers;\n\u2022\ncurrency and foreign exchange risks; and\n\u2022\npotential delays or disruptions in transportation as well as potential border delays or disruptions.\nAlso, new regulatory initiatives may be implemented that have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include changes to Mexico\u2019s shelter maquiladora regulations, and the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions, which could increase the cost of products or services purchased from suppliers in such countries.\nAdditionally, as a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the UK Bribery Act, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to criminal or monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe financial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the United States dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating income (and conversely, the weakening of the United States dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended February 29, 2016, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected revenues by $59.0 million and unfavorably affected income from continuing operations before income taxes by $2.5 million compared to the year ended February 28, 2015. Certain transactions, particularly in foreign locations, are denominated in other than that location\u2019s local currency. Changes in the exchange rates between the two currencies from the original transaction date to the settlement date will result in a currency transaction gain or loss that directly impacts our reported earnings. For the year ended February 29, 2016, the impact of currency movements on these transactions unfavorably affected non-operating income by $1.8 million. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe social expression industry is extremely competitive, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nThe market for social expression products is large, evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future with the rapidly growing use by consumers of electronic devices and the Internet to express themselves and to communicate with others. We compete with the growing number of media by which consumers express themselves and connect with others, whether by way of traditional tangible greeting cards purchased at retail stores; tangible greeting cards that incorporate personalized messages and/or images purchased at retail stores, over the Internet or using mobile devices; electronic greeting cards delivered over the Internet or using mobile devices; or social media companies that host and enable mobile access to and posting of greetings and images. We face intense competition from a wide range of companies, ranging from small, family-run organizations to major corporations. Many of the companies with which we compete may have substantially greater financial, technical or marketing resources, a greater customer base, stronger brand or name recognition and a lower cost of funds than we do. Certain of these competitors may also have longstanding relationships with certain large customers to which they may offer products that we do not provide, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. As a result, our competitors may be able to:\n\u2022\nadapt to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences more quickly;\n\u2022\ntake advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily;\n\u2022\ndevote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including sales directly to consumers through the Internet; and\n\u2022\nadopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in this market or against such competition. If we are unable to introduce new and innovative products that are attractive to our customers and ultimate consumers, or if we are unable to allocate sufficient resources to effectively market and advertise our products to achieve widespread market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively, our sales may be adversely affected, we may be required to take certain financial charges, including asset impairments, and our results of operations and financial condition could otherwise be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a number of restrictive covenants under our borrowing arrangements, which could affect our flexibility to fund ongoing operations, uses of capital and strategic initiatives, and, if we are unable to maintain compliance with such covenants, it could lead to significant challenges in meeting our liquidity requirements.\nThe terms of our borrowing arrangements contain a number of restrictive covenants, including customary operating restrictions that limit our ability to engage in such activities as borrowing and making investments, capital expenditures and distributions on our capital stock, and engaging in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales. We are also subject to customary financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. These covenants restrict the amount of our borrowings, reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic\ninitiatives. These borrowing arrangements are described in more detail in \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d under Part II, Item 7 and in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Compliance with some of these covenants is based on financial measures derived from our operating results. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business and operating results, such as through reduced customer demand and inflation. A decline in our business could make us unable to maintain compliance with these financial covenants, in which case we may be restricted in how we manage our business and deploy capital, including by limiting our ability to make acquisitions and dispositions and pay dividends. In addition, if we are unable to maintain compliance with our financial covenants or otherwise breach the covenants that we are subject to under our borrowing arrangements, our lenders could demand immediate payment of amounts outstanding and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, our credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets, including the stock of certain of our subsidiaries. If we cannot repay all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit agreement, our lenders could proceed against our assets.\nPending litigation could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs described in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report, from time to time we are engaged in lawsuits which may require significant management time and attention and legal expense, and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. Any estimates of loss regarding pending litigation disclosed from time to time would be based on information that is then available to us and may not reflect any particular final outcome. The results of rulings, judgments or settlements of such litigation may result in financial liability that is materially higher than what management estimated at the time. We make no assurances that we will not be subject to liability with respect to current or future litigation. We maintain various forms of insurance coverage. However, substantial rulings, judgments or settlements could exceed the amount of insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of an existing insurance policy.\nWe have been and may in the future be the subject of actions by third parties alleging infringement of proprietary rights, especially with respect to our Internet and mobile businesses.\nWe may be involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These include claims, suits and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights. In particular, the industry in which our Internet and mobile businesses operate is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.\nChanges in federal, state and local or foreign tax law and interpretations of existing tax law could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state or provincial and local levels in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, including those that may result from the Base Erosion Profit Shifting, or BEPS, initiative being conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Additionally, changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax or the amount of income allocated to such jurisdictions could negatively impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, from time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\nOur estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at the time. We use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income\ntaxes and other tax-related accounts. Our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate and/or our financial results.\nWe have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our future operating results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances, with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate. Our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation.\nWe may not be able to acquire or maintain advantageous content licenses from third parties to produce products.\nTo provide an assortment of relevant, compelling and superior product offerings, an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various popular brands, celebrities, character properties, designs, copy, music and other material owned by third parties. In the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous licenses, we may not be able to meet changing customer demands and preferences for greeting cards and our other products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not realize the full benefit of the material we license from third parties if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.\nThe agreements under which we license popular brands, celebrities, character properties, design, copy, music and other material owned by third parties usually require that we pay an advance and/or provide a minimum royalty guarantee that may be substantial. In some cases, these advances or minimums may be greater than what we will be able to recoup in profits from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of such amounts that would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may acquire or renew licenses requiring minimum guarantee payments that may result in us paying higher effective royalties, if the overall benefit of obtaining the license outweighs the risk of potentially losing, not renewing or otherwise not obtaining a valuable license. When obtaining a license, we realize there is no guarantee that a particular licensed property will make a successful greeting card or other product in the eye of the ultimate consumer. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful licensed property will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future.\nOur inability to protect or defend our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe believe that our trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brands, success and competitive position. We rely on trademark, copyright, trade secrets and patent laws in the United States and similar laws in other jurisdictions and on confidentiality and other types of agreements with some employees, vendors, consultants and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these measures, if we are unable to successfully file for, register or otherwise protect and enforce our rights or if these rights are infringed, invalidated, challenged, circumvented or misappropriated, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Also, we are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims in the United States or foreign countries, which could limit our ability to use certain intellectual property, products or brands in the future. Defending any such claims, even claims without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly settlements, litigation or restrictions on our business and could damage our reputation.\nRapidly changing trends in the children\u2019s entertainment market could adversely affect our business.\nA portion of our business and results of operations depends upon the appeal of our licensed character properties, which are used to create various toy and entertainment items for children. Consumer preferences, particularly among children, are continuously changing. The children\u2019s entertainment industry experiences significant, sudden and often\nunpredictable shifts in demand caused by changes in the preferences of children to more \u201con trend\u201d entertainment properties. Moreover, the life cycle for individual youth entertainment products tends to be short. Therefore, our ability to maintain our current market position and grow our business in the future depends on our ability to satisfy consumer preferences by enhancing existing entertainment properties and developing new entertainment properties. If we are not able to meet these challenges successfully in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for our collection of entertainment properties could decrease and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs developing entertainment properties that may not generate future revenues at the levels that we anticipated, which could in turn create fluctuations in our reported results based on when those costs are expensed and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nThe social expression industry is a seasonal business, with sales generally being higher in the second half of our fiscal year due to the concentration of major holidays during that period. Consequently, our overall results of operations in the future may fluctuate substantially based on seasonal demand for our products. Such variations in demand could have a material adverse effect on the timing of cash flow and therefore our ability to meet our obligations with respect to our debt and other financial commitments. Seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, because we usually order and manufacture merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new trends are confirmed by customer orders or consumer purchases. We must carry significant amounts of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. If we are not successful in selling the inventory during the holiday period, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices, or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all.\nOur results of operations will not include results from businesses that we recently sold.\nDuring fiscal 2015 we sold our fixtures business and in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we sold our Strawberry Shortcake property. During fiscal 2014, our fixtures business contributed revenue and operating income to our consolidated results of approximately $49.4 million and $17.4 million, respectively. During fiscal 2015, our Strawberry Shortcake property contributed royalty revenue to our consolidated results of approximately $14.6 million. As a result, our future results of operations will be lower than prior periods unless we are able to replace the revenue and operating income associated with these businesses through our remaining business operations, by means of future acquisitions or otherwise.\nIncreases in raw material and energy costs, and the consolidation of raw material suppliers and critical service providers, may materially raise our costs and materially impact our profitability.\nPaper is a significant expense in the production of our greeting cards. Significant increases in paper prices or increased costs of other raw materials or energy, such as fuel, may result in declining margins and operating results if market conditions prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases on our greeting cards and other social expression products. In addition, the growing consolidation in the paper industry and small package freight industry is expected to reduce our negotiating position with such suppliers, which may make obtaining competitive terms more difficult.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management and creative teams could adversely affect our business.\nOur success and continued growth depend largely on the efforts and abilities of our current senior management team as well as upon a number of key members of our creative staff, who have been instrumental in our success thus far, and upon our ability to attract and retain other highly capable and creative individuals. The loss of some of our senior executives or key members of our creative staff, or an inability to attract or retain other key individuals, could materially and adversely affect us. We seek to compensate our key executives, as well as other employees, through competitive salaries, bonus plans or other incentives, but we can make no assurance that these programs will enable us to retain key employees or hire new employees.\nIf we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike, or other work stoppage, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a large number of our employees. In particular, approximately 725 of our employees are unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Although we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work-related stoppage, we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEmployee benefit costs constitute a significant element of our annual expenses and funding these costs could adversely affect our financial condition.\nEmployee benefit costs are a significant element of our cost structure. Certain expenses, particularly healthcare costs, may increase significantly at a rate that is difficult to forecast and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, federal healthcare legislation may increase our employer-sponsored medical plan costs, some of which increases could be significant. Declines in global capital markets may cause reductions in the value of our pension plan assets. Such circumstances could have an adverse effect on future pension expense and funding requirements. Further information regarding our retirement benefits is presented in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nVarious environmental regulations and risks applicable to a manufacturer and/or distributor of consumer products may require us to take actions, which will adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations with respect to chemical usage, air emissions, wastewater and storm water discharges and other releases into the environment as well as the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials, including hazardous materials. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation, these laws and regulations may give rise to claims, uncertainties or possible loss contingencies for future environmental remediation liabilities for which we are unable to predict the ultimate cost, which may be significant, or the effect on our operations. We have implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The costs associated with these compliance and remediation efforts have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or operating results. We cannot be certain that existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, will not have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The impact of increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, regulatory enforcement activities, the discovery of unknown conditions, and third-party claims for damages to the environment, real property or persons could result in additional liabilities and costs in the future. Additionally, some state governments (for instance Washington, California, Minnesota, Maine and Oregon) are increasingly introducing legislation to require consumer product manufacturers to report whether their products contain certain chemicals and/or to ban products containing certain chemicals which the state has determined to be of concern to the health and safety of its residents. Several of the chemicals already subject to such regulation are contained in our products and we believe we are in substantial compliance with current applicable state regulations, but we are unable to predict how many other states will implement such legislation, whether it will apply to our products, and the testing and administrative costs of compliance.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims and our products could be subject to voluntary or involuntary recalls and other actions.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial and foreign laws and regulations governing product safety including, but not limited to, those regulations enforced by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Health Canada, UK local authority trading standards departments, UK Health and Safety Executive, and Australia\u2019s Consumer Affairs unit of the Department of Justice. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations, or\nconcerns about product safety may lead to a recall of selected products. We have experienced, and in the future may experience, recalls and defects or errors in products after their production and sale to customers. Such recalls and defects or errors could result in the rejection of our products by our retail customers and consumers, damage to our reputation, lost sales, diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs, any of which could harm our business. Individuals could sustain injuries from our products and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries. Governmental agencies could pursue us and issue civil fines and/or criminal penalties for a failure to comply with product safety regulations. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Additionally, we may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future. Recalls, post-manufacture repairs of our products, product liability claims, absence or cost of insurance and administrative costs associated with recalls could harm our reputation, increase costs or reduce sales.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, e-commerce and cellular communications is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce and cellular communications. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet or other online and cellular services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, restrictions on imports and exports, customs, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property use and ownership, sales and other taxes, fraud, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce and cellular technology as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and/or text messaging and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet, e-commerce and/or text messaging. Those laws that do reference the Internet and/or text messaging are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. For example, the DMCA is intended, in part, to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for including (or for listing or linking to third-party Web sites that include) materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. Portions of the CDA, are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute unrelated third-party content. We rely on the protections provided by both the DMCA and CDA in conducting our online business. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing their protections will subject us to greater risk of liability and may increase our costs of compliance with these regulations or limit our ability to operate certain lines of business. The Video Privacy Protection Act and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act are intended to impose additional restrictions on the ability of online service providers to disclose personally identifiable information about a consumer or collect user information from minors, respectively. The FTC Act prohibits businesses from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including by misrepresenting data privacy practices. The TCPA restricts the making of calls, faxes and texts by an autodialer unless proper consent is obtained or appropriate disclosures are made. In addition, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties may result in federal or state governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or negative public attention and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Many foreign jurisdictions, including those in which we do business, currently have significant limitations on the collection, use, storage, transfer and disposal of personal data of consumers and employees, and are considering the European Union\u2019s 1995 Data Protection Directive. The costs of compliance with these regulations may increase in the future as a result of changes in the regulations or the interpretation of them. Further, any failures on our part to comply with these regulations may subject us to significant liabilities. Those current and future laws and regulations or unfavorable resolution of these issues may substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nFailure to protect information of our user and employee base and our network against security breaches or failure to comply with security laws and regulations could damage our reputation and brands and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nAn important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our consumers, customers, employees and vendors. A significant challenge to e-commerce and communications is the secure transmission of information over public networks. Our failure to monitor, protect and prevent security breaches could damage our reputation and brands and harm our business and results of operations. In transactions conducted\nover the Internet, maintaining security for the transmission of information on our Web sites is essential to maintain consumer confidence and brand reputation. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff.\nAny compromise of our security could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may need to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches.\nInformation technology infrastructure failures could significantly affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives. Portions of our information technology infrastructure are old and difficult to maintain. We could experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a computer virus, a problem with the functioning of an important information technology application, or an intentional disruption of our information technology systems. In addition, our information technology systems could suffer damage or interruption from human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, terrorist attacks, acts of war and similar events. The disruptions caused by any such events could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, properly store images, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. Any such event could impact our ability to create, design or manufacture product, cause us to lose customers or revenue, damage our reputation, and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns.\nContinuing over the next several years, we expect to allocate resources, including capital, to refresh our information technology systems by modernizing our systems, redesigning and deploying new processes, and evolving new organization structures, all of which are intended to drive efficiencies within the business and add new capabilities. Such an implementation is expensive and carries substantial operational risk, including loss of data or information, unanticipated increases in costs, disruption of operations and business interruption. Further, we may not be successful implementing new systems or any new system may not perform as expected. This could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe project to relocate our world headquarters could result in cost overruns and disruptions to our operations.\nOur project to construct and relocate to a new world headquarters was put on hold in connection with the Going Private Proposal. When the Merger closed, we resumed the project. The gross costs associated with the new world headquarters building, before any tax credits, loans or other incentives, are expected to be between approximately $150 million and $200 million. Although the majority of the cost of construction of the new world headquarters is expected to be financed through the Corporation\u2019s affiliate, H L & L Property Company (\u201cH L & L\u201d), due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature, the costs associated with this project may be higher than expected and we may have to dedicate additional funds to the project, including providing additional funds to H L & L or its direct or indirect parents. Furthermore, we may be unable to benefit from all of the state and local incentives made available to assist in the development of the new world headquarters if we are unable to satisfy the requirements that we must meet to receive the benefits. For example, certain of the incentives offered require us to maintain certain employment and payroll thresholds. If we are unable to satisfy these requirements, the benefits are subject to partial, and in some instances complete, reduction. In addition, the process of moving our world headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day-to-day operations. Thus, that process could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nActs of nature could result in an increase in the cost of raw materials; other catastrophic events, including earthquakes, could interrupt critical functions and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nActs of nature could result in an increase in the cost of raw materials or a shortage of raw materials, which could influence the cost of goods supplied to us. Additionally, we have significant operations, including our largest manufacturing facility, near a major earthquake fault line in Arkansas. A catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, fire, tornado, or other natural or man-made disaster, could disrupt our operations and impair production or distribution of our products, damage inventory, interrupt critical functions or otherwise affect our business negatively, harming our results of operations.\nWe are indirectly owned and controlled by members of the Weiss family, and their interests as equity holders may conflict with the interest of holders of American Greetings\u2019 debt.\nWe are indirectly owned and controlled by the Weiss family, some of whom are executive officers and directors of American Greetings and its subsidiaries, and who have the ability to control our policy and operations. The interests of the members of the Weiss family may not in all cases be aligned with interests of the holders of our debt. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of the members of the Weiss family might conflict with the interests of holders of our debt. In addition, members of the Weiss family may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve heightened risks to holders of our debt.", "PERMNO": 13056, "SIC": 2771, "TIC": "AM.1"}
