exposed to fluctuating prices of oil and natural gas and decreased demand for oil and natural gas.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s offshore support services is impacted by the comparative price for exploring, developing, and producing oil and natural gas and by the corresponding supply and demand for oil and natural gas, both globally and regionally. Among other factors, the increased supply of oil and natural gas from the development of unconventional oil and natural gas supply sources, particularly shale, and technologies to improve recovery from current sources have caused volatility in the price of oil and natural gas as well as a reduction of demand and prices charged for offshore support services globally. The advent of electric cars and the development of alternative sources of energy to hydrocarbons, such as solar and wind power and other developing technology, as well as increasing regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and actions taken and expected to be taken by companies, governments and investors to reduce dependence on hydrocarbon based fuels, are widely expected to further diminish the demand for oil and natural gas in the coming years. Such diminution of demand could place continued or additional pressure on the price of oil and therefore demand for the Company\u2019s services, as developing offshore oil fields, particularly in deep waters, is one of the most expensive sources of hydrocarbons. Other factors that influence the supply and demand and the relative price of oil and natural gas include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, political instability, conflicts, civil unrest, the worldwide economic, political and military environment, acts of terrorism, foreign exchange rates, economic conditions and actions by major hydrocarbon-producing countries. The price of oil and natural gas and the relative cost to extract, proximity to market and political imperatives of countries with offshore deposits affect the willingness to commit investment for contract drilling rigs and offshore support vessels used for offshore exploration, field development and production activities, which in turn affects the Company\u2019s results of operations. Prolonged periods of low oil and natural gas prices or rising costs result in lower demand for the Company\u2019s services and can give rise to impairments of the Company\u2019s assets.\nThe Company\u2019s operations depend on the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, development and production, maintenance and decommissioning activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile over the past few years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. For example, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel during 2014, followed by a near ten-year low of $26 per barrel in February 2016, and then a high of $76 per barrel in October 2018. The West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) front month oil prices experienced unprecedented volatility during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effects on the global economy, including going negative for a short period of time. While oil prices have steadily increased since the lows hit at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and recently hit a $116 per barrel high primarily as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, no assurances can be given that the increases will continue or be sustained or that our business will benefit from the increase.\nDeclines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand. Since developing offshore oil fields, particularly in deep waters, is one of the most expensive sources of hydrocarbons and providing transportation and logistics services to these markets is the largest component of the Company\u2019s business, the Company is particularly exposed to depressed oil and natural gas prices that last for some period of time. When the Company\u2019s customers experience low commodity prices or come to believe that they will be low in the future, they generally reduce their capital spending for offshore drilling, exploration and field development. The significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices that began in the second half of 2014 caused a reduction in many of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 exploratory, drilling, completion and other production activities and, as a result, related spending on the Company\u2019s services. As such, the Company\u2019s overall fleet utilization for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was 66%, 55% and 60%, respectively. The prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities has materially and adversely affected the Company by negatively impacting its fleet utilization, which in turn has negatively affected its revenues, cash flows, profitability and the fair market value of the Company\u2019s vessels. It could also affect the collectability of the Company\u2019s receivables and its ability to retain skilled personnel. Periods of low activity intensify price competition in the industry, which erodes operating margin, and can lead to the Company\u2019s vessels being idle for long periods of time.\nIf difficult market conditions persist, any recovery we or our industry anticipates fails to materialize or is delayed beyond expectations, further deterioration in the fair value of vessels already impaired or revisions to its forecasts may result in the Company recording additional impairment charges related to its fleet in future periods.\nDemand for many of the Company\u2019s services is impacted by the level of activity in the offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production industry.\nThe level of offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity has historically been volatile. This volatility is likely to continue. The level of activity is subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in a variety of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including:\n\u2022\nthe worldwide economic environment, trends in international trade or other economic trends, including recessions and the level of activity in energy-consuming markets;\n\u2022\nprevailing oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices and price volatility;\n\u2022\nassessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas offshore and the relative cost of, and success in, doing so on land, including fracking and other technologies that make it more economical to produce oil from non-traditional sources;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of oil and natural gas and oil service companies operating offshore;\n\u2022\nworldwide supply and demand for energy, petroleum products and chemical products;\n\u2022\navailability and rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u2022\nfederal, state, local and international political and economic conditions, and policies including cabotage and local content laws;\n\u2022\ntechnological advancements affecting exploration, development, energy production and consumption;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil and natural gas production by non-OPEC countries and the acceptance of oil produced by Iran by other countries throughout the world;\n\u2022\ninternational sanctions on oil producing countries including certain sanctions against Iran;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest and the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities involving the Middle East, Russia, Venezuela, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulation;\n\u2022\nregulation of drilling activities and the availability of drilling permits and concessions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate or otherwise obtain funds for capital projects; and\n\u2022\nincrease in the use and exploitation of renewable energy and the development of alternative fuel or energy sources.\nThe prolonged material downturn in oil and natural gas prices until the recent recovery experienced in 2021 caused a substantial decline in expenditures for exploration, development and production activity, which resulted in a decline in demand and lower rates for the Company\u2019s offshore energy support services and, in turn, lower utilization levels over the last five years. Although activity levels have recovered somewhat in 2021, continued under-investment by our customers or a new decrease in activity could further reduce the Company\u2019s day rates and its utilization, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In addition, an increase in commodity demand and prices will not necessarily result in an immediate increase in offshore drilling activity since project development lead and planning times, reserve replacement needs, expectations of future commodity demand, energy transition, customer capital discipline, prices and supply of available competing vessels all combine to affect demand for the Company\u2019s vessels.\nThe Company operates in four primary regions: the U.S. (primarily the Gulf of Mexico), Africa and Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Asia. The volume of work contributed by each region changes periodically due to a number of factors including how active each region is, how many vessels are working in each region and the changing regulatory landscape of the applicable region. For instance, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 12%, 11% and 25%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s operating revenues were earned in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Company has some ability to shift the location of its assets between regions depending upon local regulation and cost of doing business, among many other factors, and, while it has repositioned some assets from less active regions to other regions and may continue to do so in the future, such efforts may not be sufficient to counter the latest downturn in the regions on which we rely in any given year.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in the price of and demand for oil, which has caused, and may continue to cause, a decrease in the demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nDuring 2020, oil prices experienced record declines in response to a significant amount of oversupply in oil and natural gas caused by (i) the COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2019 and has led to a substantial decrease in global economic activity and (ii) supply decisions made principally by Russia and Saudi Arabia resulting in the failure to agree on terms to maintain production limits and the ensuing influx of additional oil to an already oversupplied market. These declines in oil and natural gas prices were on top of prices that had already been below historic averages. On January 2, 2020, WTI crude oil prices closed at a price of $61.18 per barrel. On April 20, 2020, the NYMEX WTI oil futures price for May 2020 went \u201cnegative\u201d to -$37.63 per barrel. While WTI front month crude oil prices have recovered and now even exceed pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, if the severity of the pandemic were to significantly worsen it could have a negative effect on demand for oil and natural gas resulting in excess supply. This excess supply\ncould, in turn, result in transportation and storage capacity constraints in the United States, or even the elimination of available storage. Decreases in prices and continued uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could cause the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 to reduce exploratory, drilling, completion and other production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s operation and workforce faces risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and financial results were adversely affected in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of decreased demand and the increase in costs due to operational changes enacted to enhance crew and onshore employee safety.\nIn addition, the pandemic may affect the health of the Company\u2019s workforce, and international, national and local government interventions enacted to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may render the Company\u2019s employees unable to commute to work and/or travel. Although the Company\u2019s workforce is largely considered to be \u201cessential\u201d under guidance issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, work, travel and other restrictions may vary in other regions of the world in which the Company has significant operations, such as Africa and Europe, Middle East and Asia, and Latin America. Therefore, the Company may experience reduced productivity and an inability to fully support its offshore operations if the Company\u2019s onshore personnel work remotely due to restrictions related to COVID-19. In addition, while many governments have recently relaxed COVID-19 related restrictions increases in infection rates, such restrictions may be reinstituted at any time and could be more severe than they were initially.\nAdditionally, an outbreak of COVID-19 on any of the Company\u2019s vessels may result in the vessel, or some or all of the vessel crew, being quarantined, which would hinder the vessel\u2019s ability to generate revenue and the crew\u2019s ability to man any substitute vessel. The Company may also experience challenges in connection with the Company\u2019s offshore crew changes due to health and travel restrictions related to COVID-19. The duration and severity of the business disruption and related financial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. If the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time, not only could it materially adversely affect the demand for the Company\u2019s services but also the ability of the Company to provide such services, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate many of the other risks set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and the Company\u2019s other SEC filings, such as those relating to the Company\u2019s financial performance and debt obligations and ability to crew its vessels.\nAny further outbreak of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments, or the fear of such events, may cause similar issues or require the implementation of additional restrictions and precautionary measures. Any such restrictions or precautionary measures may curtail travel or impact the delivery or mobilization of vessels to and from certain countries, or geographic regions, or the ability to crew vessels appropriately. Any prolonged disruption of our delivery or mobilization schedule would likely impact our financial and operating results. A health epidemic or other outbreak may impact certain of our crews, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent an outbreak of any such diseases cause a deterioration of the global economy it could impact oil and natural gas prices, which in turn could impact our business.\nRestrictions imposed by the terms of the Company\u2019s existing credit facilities or future indebtedness it may incur can limit the Company\u2019s operating and financial flexibility. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet the requirements of its financial covenants on an ongoing basis or that if it should fail to meet such covenants in the future, the lender under the relevant credit agreement will agree to waivers or amendments with respect thereto.\nMany of the Company\u2019s existing credit facilities impose, and its future credit facilities may impose, restrictions, such as negative covenants and maintenance of financial ratio covenants, which may limit its operating and financial flexibility. Negative covenants such as limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness or liens may affect the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional debt if needed, while asset sale covenants could affect its ability to sell assets to generate liquidity and properly manage its fleet size. Requirements to maintain a minimum level of liquidity could also affect cash available for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and general corporate purposes. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain financial ratio covenants may be affected by general economic conditions or other events beyond the Company\u2019s control and no assurance can be given that such ratios will be met in the future. If the Company is unable to meet such ratios or is otherwise unable to comply with covenants in these facilities, it may be unable to reach agreements with the lenders under such credit facilities for waivers and/or amendments to the applicable covenants. Failure to comply with these restrictions could result in the lenders accelerating all amounts due under the credit facility and potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the Company\u2019s other credit facilities.\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s debt structure.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has $401.0 million of outstanding indebtedness, including $125.0 million of its Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201cConvertible Senior Notes\u201d) and obligations under secured notes and credit facilities secured by mortgages on various vessels. This includes the $130.0 million loan facility that was entered into by SEACOR Marine Foreign Holdings Inc. (\u201cSMFH\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, on September 26, 2018.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to meet its debt service obligations and refinance its current indebtedness, as well as any future debt that it may incur, will depend upon its ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales, which are subject to general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s results of operations, industry cycles, seasonality, the general state of the capital markets at the time it seeks to refinance its debt, financial, business and other factors, some of which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the Company cannot repay or refinance its debt as it becomes due, the Company may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including undertaking alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable, dedicating an unsustainable level of the Company\u2019s cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and/or reducing the amount of liquidity available for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Company\u2019s failure to pay or refinance its current or future debt under a credit facility when it becomes due could lead to the acceleration of all amounts due under such facility and potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the Company\u2019s other credit facilities. The Company\u2019s obligations to repay indebtedness and comply with restrictive and/or financial maintenance covenants could also impair its ability to rapidly respond to changes in its business or industry and withstand competitive pressures. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information. The Company\u2019s overall debt level and/or market conditions could limit its ability to issue additional debt in amounts and/or on terms that it considers reasonable.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under certain of our debt instruments may bear interest at rates based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. The publication of USD LIBOR will cease after June 30, 2023, and the FCA confirmed that use of USD LIBOR will not be permitted in most new contracts after December 31, 2021. The Company has outstanding variable rate debt instruments (due 2021 through 2029) subject to interest rate fluctuations totaling $171.8 million that call for the Company to pay interest based on LIBOR plus applicable margins. We are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement of the LIBOR interest rate. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnconventional crude oil and natural gas sources and improved economics of producing natural gas and oil from such sources has and will likely continue to exert downward pricing pressures on the price of crude oil and natural gas.\nThe rise in production of crude oil and natural gas from shale in North America and the increased use of large Liquefied Natural Gas export facilities around the world are, at least to date, significant contributors of supply to the crude oil and natural gas market. Production of crude oil and natural gas from unconventional sources has benefited from improved drilling efficiencies that have lowered the costs of extraction from these sources. The rise in production of natural gas and oil from these sources not only affects the price of natural gas and oil but can also result in a reduction of capital invested in offshore oil and natural gas exploration. Because the Company provides vessels servicing offshore oil and natural gas exploration, a significant reduction in investments in offshore exploration and development in favor of investments in these unconventional resources could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle vessels\nWhile the Company did not recognize any impairment charges in 2021, during 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $18.8 million and $12.0 million, respectively, related to tangible assets. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low day or charter rates, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of the Company\u2019s assets may cause the Company to record additional impairments. If there are indications that the carrying value of any of the Company\u2019s vessels may not be recoverable or if the Company sells assets for less than their then carrying value, the Company may recognize additional impairment charges on its fleet.\nThere is a high level of competition in the offshore marine service industry.\nThe Company operates in a highly fragmented and competitive industry, and the competitive nature of its industry and excess supply of equipment is currently depressing charter and utilization rates. If the period of depressed rates experienced over the last few years continues, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance. The Company competes for business on the basis of price, reputation for excellent service, quality, suitability and technical capabilities of its vessels, availability of vessels, safety and efficiency, cost of mobilizing vessels from one market to a different market, and national flag preference. Competition has intensified as lower activity in the offshore oil and natural gas market has led to lower utilization and additional capacity. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring, among other things, local construction, flagging, ownership or control of vessels, the awarding of contracts to local contractors, the employment of local citizens and/or the purchase of supplies from local vendors. Furthermore, the Company competes with companies that have undergone significant restructuring which has substantially reduced their debt levels thereby vastly improving their balance sheets.\nThe process of obtaining new charter agreements is highly competitive and generally involves an intensive screening and a competitive bidding process, which, in certain cases, may extend for several months. The Company\u2019s existing and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial resources than the Company. In addition, competitors with greater resources may have larger fleets, or could operate larger fleets through consolidations, acquisitions, new buildings or pooling of their vessels with other companies, and, therefore, may be able to offer a more competitive service than the Company, including better charter rates. The Company expects competition from a number of experienced companies providing contracts to potential customers, including state-sponsored entities and major energy companies affiliated with the projects requiring offshore vessel services. As a result, the Company may be unable to expand its relationships with existing customers or to obtain new customers on a profitable basis, if at all. If the Company is unable to successfully compete, it could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nAn oversupply of vessels or equipment that serve offshore oil and natural gas operations could have an adverse impact on the charter rates earned by the Company\u2019s vessels and equipment.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive, with oversupply of vessel capacity and intense price competition. Expansion of the supply of vessels and equipment that serve offshore oil and natural gas operations in the decade prior to 2017 increased competition in the markets in which the Company operates and affected prices charged by operators. Further, the refurbishment of disused or \u201cmothballed\u201d vessels, conversion of vessels from uses other than oil and natural gas exploration and production support and related activities or construction of new vessels and equipment could add vessel and equipment capacity to current worldwide levels. The current oversupply of vessels and equipment capacity in the offshore marine market could lower charter rates and result in lower operating revenues, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company relies on several customers for a significant share of its revenues, the loss of any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company\u2019s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 76%, 76% and 61%, respectively, of its operating revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers, Seacor Marine Arabia LLC, a joint venture through which vessels are chartered to Saudi Aramco, and Exxon Mobil, were together responsible for 38% or more of the Company\u2019s operating revenues from continuing operations. In addition, one or more of the Company\u2019s joint ventures rely primarily on a single customer for their revenues. The portion of the Company\u2019s revenues or any of its joint ventures\u2019 revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time, depending on the level of activity by any such customer, the Company\u2019s ability to meet the customer\u2019s needs and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. In addition, most of the Company\u2019s contracts with its customers can be canceled on relatively short notice and do not commit its customers to acquire specific amounts of services or require the payment of significant liquidated damages upon cancellation. The loss of business from any of the Company\u2019s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Further, to the extent any of the Company\u2019s customers experience an extended period of operating difficulty, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operation, cash flows and prospects.\nConsolidation of the Company\u2019s customer base could adversely affect demand for its services and reduce its revenues.\nIn recent years, oil and natural gas companies, energy companies, drilling contractors and other offshore service providers have undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible, especially as the depressed oil price environment has caused many of these companies to restructure their operations and capital structure, including substantially reducing their debt levels. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for the Company\u2019s services. Also, merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration, development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed. Such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation, which could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s vessels thereby reducing its revenues.\nThe Company may be unable to maintain or replace its vessels as they age.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the average age of the Company\u2019s owned vessels was approximately eight years. The Company believes that after a vessel has been in service for approximately 20 years, the expense (which typically increases with age) necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable. In addition, the Company must maintain its vessels to remain attractive to its customers and comply with regulations, including updating or replacing systems and equipment, however, the Company may be unable to carry out drydockings of its vessels, may be limited by insufficient shipyard capacity or its systems and equipment may become obsolete and unsupported by the manufacturer or other service providers, which could adversely affect its ability to maintain its vessels. In addition, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable the Company to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels, or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe failure to successfully complete construction or conversion of the Company\u2019s vessels, repairs, maintenance or routine drydockings on schedule and on budget could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nFrom time to time, the Company may have a number of vessels under conversion and may plan to construct or convert other vessels in response to current and future market conditions. The Company also routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance. Construction and conversion projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, lack of shipyard availability, unforeseen engineering problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor. A significant delay in either construction or drydockings could have a material adverse effect on contract commitments and revenues with respect to vessels under construction, conversion or undergoing drydockings. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction, conversion or retrofit could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe operations of the Company\u2019s fleet may be subject to seasonal factors.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s offshore support services is directly affected by the levels of offshore drilling and production activity of its oil and gas customers, and construction and maintenance activity for its wind farm customers. Budgets of many of the Company\u2019s customers are based upon a calendar year, and demand for the Company\u2019s services has historically been stronger in the second and third calendar quarters when allocated budgets are expended by its customers and weather conditions are more favorable for offshore activities. In particular, the demand for the Company\u2019s liftboat fleet in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Europe and offshore support vessels in Europe, the Middle East and West Africa, are seasonal with peak demand normally occurring during the summer months. Adverse events relating to the Company\u2019s vessels or business operations during peak demand periods could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In addition, seasonal volatility can create unpredictability in activity and utilization rates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company has high levels of fixed costs that will be incurred regardless of its level of business activity.\nThe Company\u2019s business has high fixed costs. Maintenance downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand can have a significant negative effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition. Some of the Company\u2019s fixed costs will not decline during periods of reduced revenue or activity. During times of reduced utilization, the Company may not be able to reduce its costs immediately as it may incur additional costs associated with preparing vessels for cold stacking. Moreover, the Company may not be able to fully reduce the cost of its support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining vessels in that region. A decline in revenue due to lower day rates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in the Company\u2019s fixed costs and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nAs the markets recover or the Company changes its marketing strategies or for other reasons, the Company may be required to incur higher than expected costs to return previously cold-stacked vessels to class.\nIn response to the decrease in demand stemming from lower oil and natural gas prices, the Company has cold-stacked a number of vessels. As of December 31, 2021, five of 60 owned and leased-in vessels were cold-stacked worldwide. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to quickly bring these cold-stacked vessels back into service or that the cost of doing so would not be significant. Cold-stacked vessels do not receive the same level of maintenance as active vessels. As a result and depending on the length of time the vessels are cold-stacked, the Company could incur deferred drydocking costs for regulatory recertification to return these vessels to active service and may incur costs to hire and train mariners to operate such vessels. These costs are difficult to estimate and could be substantial. Delay in reactivating cold stacked vessels and the costs and other expenses related to the reactivation of cold-stacked vessels could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for its vessels.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of its customers. Given the highly competitive and historically cyclical nature of the industry, the Company may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or it may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at rates that are below, and potentially substantially below, existing day rates, or that have terms that are less favorable to the Company than its existing contracts, or it may be unable to secure contracts for these vessels. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe early termination of contracts on the Company\u2019s vessels could have a material adverse effect on its operations.\nMost of the long-term contracts for the Company\u2019s vessels contain early termination options in favor of the customer. Although some of such contracts have early termination remedies or other provisions designed to discourage the customer from exercising such options, the Company cannot assure investors that its customers would not choose to exercise their termination rights in spite of such remedies or the threat of litigation with the Company. Until replacement of such business with other customers, any termination could temporarily disrupt the Company\u2019s business or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The Company might not be able to replace such business on economically equivalent terms. In addition, during the current and prior downturns, the Company has experienced customers requesting contractual concessions even though such concessions were contrary to existing contractual terms. While the Company may not be legally required to give concessions, commercial considerations may dictate that it do so. If the Company is unable to collect amounts owed to it or long-term contracts for its vessels are terminated and its vessels are not sufficiently utilized, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIncreased domestic and international laws and regulations may materially adversely impact the Company, and the Company may become subject to additional international laws and regulations in the event of high-profile incidents.\nRegulation of the offshore marine industry has intensified over the past several decades, and the Company expects this trend to continue. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development activities and technical and operational measures, whether or not in connection with specific incidents, may increase the Company\u2019s costs and the costs of its customers\u2019 operations. For instance, in response to fatalities and environmental damages caused by a 2010 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon, a drilling rig operating in the Gulf of Mexico, various regulatory agencies imposed temporary moratoria on drilling operations and enacted several permanent regulations designed to enhance the safety of operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Compliance with these new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations have materially increased the cost of drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. New or additional government regulations or laws concerning drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other regions have in the past and could in the future materially increase the cost of drilling operations in those markets or cause additional moratoria on drilling activities. These changes may influence decisions by customers or other industry participants that could reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services. Moreover, continuing changes in regulation make it more difficult for the Company to implement long-term plans. For these reasons, further changes in regulation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and natural gas.\nThe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the release or continued use of offshore resources for oil and natural gas production. The current extent of permitted offshore leasing is uncertain. A moratorium on new offshore oil and gas drilling has remained in place for a number of years. Because the Company\u2019s operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production, the government\u2019s exercise of authority under the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to restrict the availability of offshore oil and natural gas leases (for example, due to a serious incident of pollution) could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company is subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nIncreasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing worker safety and health and the staffing, construction and operation of vessels significantly affect the Company\u2019s operations. Many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation and oversight, including by the USCG, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the NTSB, the IMO, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, MARAD, CBP, BSEE, the EPA and various other foreign, state or local environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and to regulation by various international bodies and classification societies (such as the American Bureau of Shipping). The Company is also subject to regulation under international treaties, such as (i) MARPOL, (ii) SOLAS, (iii) MLC, (iv) BWM Convention, (v) STCW and (vi) other port regulations. These agencies, organizations, regulations and treaties establish safety requirements and standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved safety standards. CBP and USCG are authorized to inspect vessels at will. The Company has and will continue to spend significant funds to comply with these regulations and treaties. Failure to comply with these regulations and treaties may cause the Company to incur significant liabilities or restrictions on its operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health, including laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into waters regulated thereunder. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, or other sanctions, or the suspension or termination of the Company\u2019s operations. Compliance with such laws and regulations frequently require installation of costly equipment, increased staffing, increased fuel costs, specific training, or operational changes. Some environmental laws impose strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous materials and damage to natural resources, which could subject the Company to liability without regard to whether it is negligent or at fault. Under OPA 90, owners, operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the removal costs and damages resulting from the discharge of oil within the navigable waters of the U.S. and the EEZ. In addition, an oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties, criminal liability and costs for natural resource and other damages under other federal and state laws and civil actions. Liability for a catastrophic spill could exceed the Company\u2019s available insurance coverage and result in it having to liquidate assets to pay claims. These laws and regulations may expose the Company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, including charterers. Because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations. Additionally, reduced enforcement of existing safety and other laws or regulations may result in a decline in the demand for the Company\u2019s offshore support services that are provided in connection with compliance with such laws or regulations. The Company cannot be certain that existing laws, regulations or standards (and the enforcement thereof), as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws and regulations and standards will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Regulation of the offshore marine services industry will likely continue to become more stringent and more expensive for the Company. In addition, a serious marine incident that results in significant pollution or injury could result in additional regulation and lead to strict governmental enforcement or other legal challenges. The variability and uncertainty of current and future shipping regulations could hamper the ability of the Company and its customers to plan for the future or establish long-term strategies. Additional environmental and other requirements, as well as more stringent enforcement policies, may be adopted that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate, require the Company to incur substantial additional costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. For more information, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Governmental Regulations -Environmental Compliance.\u201d\nThe Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain, maintain and periodically renew certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations or vessels. In certain instances, the failure to obtain, maintain or renew these authorizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThere are risks associated with climate change, environmental regulations and evolving environmental expectations.\nGovernments, supranational groups and various other parties around the world, including some of the world\u2019s largest investment managers, have, in recent years, proposed or adopted new laws, regulations and/or policies pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that could result in a reduction in demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel. In fact, a number of countries and organizations have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures or international treaties may include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy and could include specific restrictions on shipping emissions.\nAdditionally, some institutional investors and other groups have focused on matters affecting the environment, which may result in reduced investment in, or financing available to, the hydrocarbon-based industry. Many of these groups have developed environmental, social and governance standards as benchmarks and are using those benchmarks to inform their investment criteria. Although the Company formed a new Sustainability Council in 2020 to oversee the Company\u2019s enhanced environmental, social and governance program and published its Inaugural Sustainability Report, the Company may not meet these evolving standards or benchmarks. Positions the Company takes or does not take on these issues could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to attract or retain customers or employees. Similarly, any failure to achieve the Company\u2019s environmental, social or governance commitments could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its business, stock price or access to capital.\nGovernments could also pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy. These requirements could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and therefore the services provided by the Company. In addition, new environmental or emissions control laws or regulations may require an increase in the Company\u2019s operating costs and/or in its capital spending for additional equipment or personnel to comply with such requirements and could also result in a reduction in revenues due to downtime required for the installation of such equipment. Moreover, various international conventions and federal, state or international laws have significantly increased their regulation of vessel fuel and emissions in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. Any of these developments, requirements or initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nFrom time to time, extreme weather causes the Company or its customers to suspend business operations. Climate change may increase the frequency or severity of these extreme weather events in the future, which could increase the Company\u2019s exposure to suspended operations. Also, concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, which could accelerate the above-described trends towards enhanced regulation of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company has significant international operations, which subjects it to risks. Unstable political, military and economic conditions in foreign countries where a significant proportion of the Company\u2019s operations is conducted could materially adversely impact its business.\nThe Company operates vessels and transacts other business worldwide. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 88%, 89% and 75%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s operating revenues and $15.4 million, ($7.5) million and ($13.5), respectively, of its equity in losses from 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, were derived from foreign operations. These operations are subject to risks, including potential vessel seizure, terrorist acts, piracy, kidnapping, nationalization of assets, currency restrictions, import or export quotas, tariffs and other forms of public and government regulation, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Economic sanctions or an oil embargo, for example, could have significant impact on activity in the oil and natural gas industry and, correspondingly, on the Company should it operate in an area subject to any sanctions or embargo, or in the surrounding region to the extent any sanctions or embargo disrupts its operations.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors, or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Further, the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company.\nActivity outside the U.S. involves additional risks, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nU.S. embargoes or restrictive actions and regulations by U.S. and foreign governments that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to provide services in foreign countries or cause retaliatory actions by such governments;\n\u2022\na change in, or the imposition of, withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of earnings or currency exchange controls and import/export quotas;\n\u2022\nunwaivable, burdensome local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements;\n\u2022\nnationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nloss of contract rights and inability to enforce contracts;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist acts, piracy and kidnapping;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for the Company\u2019s services and its profitability;\n\u2022\npotential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010;\n\u2022\nlabor strikes;\n\u2022\nimport or export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nregional conflicts, including in Ukraine;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, including the ability to transfer qualified labor to local operations; and\n\u2022\ninadequate or delayed response to natural disasters on other major incidents or events in less developed countries.\nSome of the Company\u2019s customers are located in emerging markets, which can further exacerbate the foregoing risks.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally left the E.U.(\u201cBrexit\u201d) and on December 24, 2020 the U.K. and E.U. agreed to a trade deal (the \u201cTrade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d) which was ratified by the U.K. on December 30, 2020. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021, and was ratified by the U.K. and E.U. on April 30, 2021, effective on May 1, 2021. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement allows the U.K and E.U. to continue trading without tariffs or quotas, however, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the E.U. may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. There are still a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the U.K. and its relationship with the E.U. and the application and interpretation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and Brexit-related matters may take several years to be clarified and resolved. Brexit may create global economic uncertainty, which may cause the Company\u2019s customers and potential customers to monitor their costs and reduce their budgets for the Company\u2019s services. The Company provides global marine and support transportation services to offshore energy facilities worldwide and our fleet operates globally across multiple locations. Based on our global operating model and the versatility and marketability of our fleet, to date we have not seen the impact of Brexit to be significant to the Company. Any of these effects, and others the Company cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company is subject to hazards inherent in the operation of offshore support and related vessels and has experienced accidents that have resulted in the loss of life, disrupted operations and caused reputational harm.\nThe operation of offshore support and related vessels is highly dangerous and is inherently subject to various risks including, but not limited to, adverse and sea conditions, catastrophic disaster, mechanical failure, navigation errors, capsizing, grounding, hazardous substance spills, and collision, each of which could result in the loss of life, injury to personnel, and damage to equipment and the environment. For instance, the Company\u2019s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be adversely affected by weather. The Atlantic hurricane season typically runs from June through November. Tropical storms and hurricanes may limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate vessels in the proximity of storms, reduce oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, and could result in the Company incurring additional expenses to secure equipment and facilities. They may also require the Company to evacuate its vessels, personnel and equipment out of the path of a storm. If any of these events were to occur, the Company could be held liable for resulting damages, including loss of revenues from or termination of charter contracts, higher insurance rates, increased operating costs, increased governmental regulation and reporting and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and customer relationships. Any such events would likely result in negative publicity for the Company and adversely affect its safety record, which would affect demand for its services in a competitive industry. In addition, the affected vessels could be removed from service and would then not be available to generate revenues. Our vessels have been involved in accidents in the past, some of which included loss of life, personal injury and property damage, and we, or third parties operating our vessels, may experience accidents in the future.\nOn April 13, 2021, the SEACOR Power, a liftboat owned by a subsidiary of the Company with nineteen individuals on board, capsized off the coast of Port Fourchon, Louisiana. The incident resulted in the death of several crew members, including the captain of the vessel and five other employees of the Company. The incident also resulted in the constructive total loss of the SEACOR Power. The Company is responsible for the salvage operations related to the vessel and is coordinating these efforts with the USCG. The Company expects salvage costs to be covered by insurance proceeds. Although the Company does not expect the incident to result in a significant impact on the environment, if there is environmental damage the Company may be responsible for any required clean-up activities and could be subject to related fines and other penalties.\nThe capsizing of the SEACOR Power has garnered significant attention from the media as well as local, state and federal stakeholders. The NTSB and the USCG are currently investigating the incident to determine the cause of the incident and the Company is fully cooperating with the investigation in all respects and continues to gather information about the incident. It is expected that the NTSB and USCG investigation will take a significant period of time to complete, possibly as long as two years or longer. It is also possible that other state and federal legislatures and/or agencies or other regulators will initiate investigations of the incident. Depending on the outcome of these investigations, the Company may be subject to fines and other penalties including being restricted or prohibited from operating vessels in the Gulf of Mexico for a period of time. In addition, adverse findings in any investigation could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and, in turn, the Company\u2019s competitiveness, or impact the Company\u2019s ability to market and operate liftboats.\nNumerous civil lawsuits have been filed against the Company and other third parties by the family members of deceased crew members and the surviving crew members employed by the Company or by the third parties. On June 2, 2021, the Company filed a Limitation of Liability Act complaint in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana (\u201cLimitation Action\u201d), which has the effect of enjoining all existing civil lawsuits and requiring the plaintiffs to file their claims relating to the capsizing of the SEACOR Power in the Limitation Action. The claimants have asserted, among other things, that the Company and/or the third parties failed to properly assess weather conditions, failed to provide adequate equipment for the job, failed to maintain the vessel or perform adequate safety meetings, among other claims and allegations. The Company cannot predict the outcome of any such legal proceedings but if it is found liable, any related losses could be significant. Furthermore, the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome.\nManagement has been devoting a significant amount of time and resources to the incident response, including providing assistance to the affected crewmen and their families. We expect that, at least for the near-term, management will continue to devote significant time and attention to matters related to the incident while also attending to other business concerns, which could have adverse effects on the Company and its operations.\nThere is significant uncertainty in the amount and timing of costs and potential liabilities relating to the incident involving the SEACOR Power, the impact the incident will have on the Company\u2019s reputation and the resulting possible impact on the Company\u2019s business. These uncertainties are likely to continue for a significant period. In addition, while the Company believes its existing insurance policies will adequately cover most losses, the ultimate amount of losses, potential fines and penalties, and insurance proceeds cannot be determined at this time and may depend on the outcome of any investigation. See \u201cRisk Factors -The Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect it from the liabilities that could arise in its business\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, the SEACOR Power incident has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, competitive position, financial performance, cash flows, prospects and liquidity. The risks associated with the incident could also heighten the impact of the other risks to which the group is exposed as further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFailure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to retain customers.\nThe Company\u2019s customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider. The Company must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to its customers. Should this not be achieved, the ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect it from the liabilities that could arise in its business.\nAlthough the Company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its business, risks may arise for which it may not be insured. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material, and certain policies impose caps on coverage. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, or the carrier is unable or unwilling to cover the claim, the Company could be exposed to substantial liability. Further, to the extent the proceeds from insurance are not sufficient to repair or replace a damaged asset, the Company would be required to expend funds to supplement the insurance and in certain circumstances may decide that such expenditures are not justified, which, in either case, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company may not be fully indemnified by its customers for damage to their property or the property of their other contractors.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated. Additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in the Company\u2019s contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and the Company could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. The indemnification provisions of the Company\u2019s contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or courts may find them to be unenforceable, void or limited by public policy considerations, including when the cause of the underlying loss or damage is the Company\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct, when punitive damages are attributable to the Company or when fines or penalties are imposed directly against the Company. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Current or future litigation in particular jurisdictions, whether or not the Company is a party, may impact the interpretation and enforceability of indemnification provisions in the Company\u2019s contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s contracts with its customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect the Company against all hazards and risks inherent in its operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify the Company will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.\nThe Company may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect its financial condition and its results of operations, and may result in additional risks to its business.\nThe Company continuously evaluates the acquisition and disposition of assets relevant to participants in the offshore energy industry and may in the future undertake significant transactions. Any such transaction could be material to the Company\u2019s business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, joint ventures, investments in new lines of business and the purchase of equity interests or other assets. The form of consideration associated with such transactions may include, among other things, cash, Common Stock, securities convertible into Common Stock or other securities (privately or through a public offering), equity interests in the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, or other assets of the Company. The Company also evaluates the disposition of its assets, in whole or in part, which could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests in its subsidiaries (privately or through a public offering).\nThese types of significant transactions may present material risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant revenue and income streams, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, potential acceleration of taxes currently deferred, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain covenants in the Company\u2019s debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. If the Company was to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, it may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in the amount of debt the Company has or the number of outstanding shares of its Common Stock. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, the Company cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of the anticipated benefits of the transaction or that significant transactions will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial positions, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIf the Company does not restrict the amount of ownership of its Common Stock by non-U.S. citizens, it could be prohibited from operating offshore support vessels in the United States, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe Company is subject to the Jones Act, which governs, among other things, the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry passengers and cargo between points in the U.S. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews and be owned and operated by \u201cU.S. citizens\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act. Compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% in the entities that directly or indirectly own or operate the vessels that the Company operates in U.S. coastwise trade. Although the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated By-Laws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the Jones Act, a failure to maintain compliance could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects by, among other things (i) temporarily or permanently prohibiting the Company from operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade, (ii) subjecting the Company to fines and (iii) subjecting the Company\u2019s vessels to seizure and forfeiture.\nRepeal, amendment, suspension or non-enforcement of the Jones Act would result in additional competition for the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nSubstantial portions of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and thus subject to the provisions of the Jones Act (discussed above). For years, there have been attempts to repeal or amend such provisions, and such attempts are expected to continue in the future.\nRepeal, substantial amendment, waiver or substantial reinterpretation of provisions of the Jones Act could significantly adversely affect the Company by, among other things, resulting in additional competition from competitors with lower operating costs, because of their ability to use vessels built in lower-cost foreign shipyards, owned and manned by foreign nationals with promotional foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than U.S. citizens. In addition, the Company\u2019s advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of maritime cargo between covered U.S. points could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Because foreign vessels may have lower construction costs and operate at significantly lower costs than companies operating in the U.S. coastwise trade, such a change could significantly increase competition in the U.S. coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nRestrictions on non-U.S. citizen ownership of the Company\u2019s vessels could limit its ability to sell off any portion of its business or result in the forfeiture of its vessels.\nAs noted above, compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% in the entities that directly or indirectly own or operate the vessels that the Company operates in the U.S. coastwise trade. If the Company were to seek to sell any portion of its business that owns any of these vessels, it may have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the U.S. citizenship restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of the Company\u2019s business may not attain the amount that could be obtained through unconstrained bidding. Furthermore, if at any point the Company or any of the entities that directly or indirectly own its vessels cease to satisfy the requirements to be a U.S. citizen within the meaning of the Jones Act, the Company would become ineligible to operate in the U.S. coastwise trade and may become subject to penalties and risk forfeiture of its vessels.\nThe Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and its Third Amended and Restated By-laws limit the ownership of Common Stock by individuals and entities that are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. These restrictions may affect the liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and may result in non-U.S. citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights.\nUnder the Jones Act, at least 75% of the outstanding shares of each class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and its Third Amended and Restated By-Laws are intended to facilitate compliance with this requirement and may have an adverse effect on holders of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. These restrictions may affect the liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nUnder the provisions of the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the aggregate percentage of ownership by non-U.S. citizens of any class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock is limited to 22.5% of the outstanding shares of each such class or series to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%. The Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation also restricts ownership of shares of any class or series of its capital stock by a single non-U.S. citizen (and any other non-U.S. citizen whose ownership position would be aggregated with such non-U.S. citizen for purposes of the Jones Act) to not more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of each such class or series. The Company refers to such percentage limitations on ownership by persons who are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act as the \u201capplicable permitted percentage.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that any transfer or purported transfer of any shares of any class or series of its capital stock that would otherwise result in ownership (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens of shares of such class or series in excess of the applicable permitted percentage will be void and ineffective, and neither the Company nor its transfer agent will register any such transfer or purported transfer in the Company records or recognize any such transferee or purported transferee as a stockholder of the Company for any purpose (including for purposes of voting and dividends) except to the extent necessary to effect the remedies available to the Company under its Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nIn the event such transfer restriction would be ineffective for any reason, the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that if any transfer would otherwise result in ownership (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens of shares of such class or series in excess of the applicable permitted percentage, such transfer will cause such excess shares to be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries that are U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. The proposed transferee will have no rights in the shares transferred to the trust, and the trustee, who will be a U.S. citizen chosen by the Company and unaffiliated with the Company or the proposed transferee, will have all voting, dividend and distribution rights associated with the shares held in the trust. The trustee will sell such excess shares to a U.S. citizen within 20 days of receiving notice from the Company (or as soon thereafter as a sale may be effected in compliance with all applicable securities laws) and distribute to the proposed transferee the lesser of the price that the proposed transferee paid for such shares and the amount received from the sale, and any gain from the sale will be paid to the charitable beneficiary of the trust.\nThese trust transfer provisions also apply to situations where ownership of a class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock by non-U.S. citizens in excess of the applicable permitted percentage would result from a change in the status of a record or beneficial owner thereof from a U.S. citizen to a non-U.S. citizen or from a repurchase or redemption by the Company of shares of its capital stock, in which case such person will receive the lesser of the market price of the shares on the date of such status change or such share repurchase or redemption and the amount received from the sale. As part of the foregoing trust transfer provisions, the trustee will be deemed to have offered the excess shares in the trust to the Company at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the market price on the date the Company accepts the offer and (ii) the price per share in the purported transfer or original issuance of shares, as described in the preceding paragraph, or the market price per share on the date of the status change or share repurchase or redemption, that resulted in the transfer to the trust.\nAs a result of the above trust transfer provisions, a proposed transferee that is a non-U.S. citizen, or a record or beneficial owner whose citizenship status change results in excess shares, or whose shares become excess shares as a result of a repurchase or redemption by the Company of its capital stock may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss.\nTo the extent that the above trust transfer provisions would be ineffective for any reason to prevent ownership (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens of the shares of any class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock in excess of the applicable permitted percentage, the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to redeem all or any portion of such excess shares most recently acquired (as determined by the Company in accordance with guidelines that are set forth in its Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation), by non-U.S. citizens, or owned (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens as a result of a change in citizenship status or a repurchase or redemption by the Company of shares of its capital stock, at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The per share redemption price may be paid, as determined by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, by cash, promissory notes, warrants or a combination thereof. Such excess shares shall not be accorded any voting, dividend or distribution rights until they have ceased to be excess shares, provided that they have not been already redeemed by the Company. As a result of the above provisions, a proposed transferee or owner of the Company\u2019s Common Stock that is a non-U.S. citizen may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss. Further, the Company may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case its financial condition may be materially weakened.\nSo that the Company may ensure its compliance with the Jones Act, its Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits the Company to require that any record or beneficial owner of any shares of its capital stock provide the Company with certain documentation concerning such owner\u2019s citizenship. These provisions include a requirement that every person acquiring, directly or indirectly, five percent (5%) or more of the shares of any class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock must provide the Company with specified citizenship documentation. In the event that any person does not submit such requested or required documentation to the Company, the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides it with certain remedies, including the suspension of the voting rights of such person's shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock and the payment of dividends and distributions with respect to those shares into an escrow account. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, a record or beneficial owner of the shares of Common Stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the foregoing restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. citizens could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the Company\u2019s Common Stock or otherwise be in the best interest of its stockholders.\nIf non-U.S. citizens own more than 22.5% of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, the Company may not have the funds or the ability to redeem any excess shares and it could be forced to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade.\nThe Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and its Third Amended and Restated By-Laws contain provisions prohibiting ownership of its Common Stock by persons who are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, in the aggregate, in excess of 22.5% of such shares, in order to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%. The Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and its Third Amended and Restated By-Laws permit the Company to redeem such excess shares in the event that the transfer of such excess shares to a trust for sale would be ineffective. The per share redemption price may be paid, as determined by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, by cash, promissory notes or warrants. However, the Company may not be able to redeem such excess shares for cash because its operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund such redemption. If, for any reason, the Company is unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non-U.S. citizens is in excess of 25% of the Common Stock, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of 25% of any such class or series of its capital stock, or fail to exercise its redemption rights because it is unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage, the Company will likely be unable to comply with the Jones Act and will likely be required by the applicable governmental authorities to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. Any such actions by governmental authorities would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nUnder certain circumstances, the Company\u2019s vessels are subject to requisition for ownership or use by governmental agencies.\nThe Merchant Marine Act of 1936 provides that, during a national emergency declared by presidential proclamation or a period for which the U.S. President has proclaimed that the security of the national defense makes it advisable, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition the ownership or use of any vessel owned by U.S. citizens (which includes the Company) and any vessel under construction in the U.S. If any of the Company\u2019s vessels were purchased or chartered by the federal government under this law, the Company would be entitled to just compensation, which is generally the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a charter, the fair market value of charter hire, but the Company would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages it may suffer. The purchase or charter for an extended period of time by the federal government of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels under this law could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Vessels registered under other flag states may also be subject to requisition or purchase in accordance with applicable local law.\nThe Company may not be able to sell vessels to improve its cash flow and liquidity because it may be unable to locate buyers with access to financing or to complete any sales on acceptable terms or within a reasonable time frame.\nThe Company may seek to sell some of its vessels to provide liquidity and cash flow. However, given the current downturn in the oil and natural gas industry in general, and the offshore oil and gas industry in particular, there may not be sufficient activity in the market to sell the Company\u2019s vessels and the Company may not be able to identify buyers with access to financing or to complete any such sales. Even if the Company is able to locate appropriate buyers for its vessels, any sales may occur on less favorable terms than the terms that might be available in a more liquid market or at other times in the business cycle. In addition, the terms of the Company\u2019s current and future indebtedness may limit its ability to sell assets, including vessels, or require that it use the proceeds from any such sale in specified manner.\nThe Company may be unable to collect amounts owed to it by its customers.\nThe Company typically grants its customers credit on a short-term basis. Related credit risks are inherent as the Company does not typically collateralize receivables due from customers. In addition, many of its international customers are state controlled and, as a result, the Company\u2019s receivables may be subject to local political priorities, which are out of the Company\u2019s control. The Company provides estimates for uncollectible accounts based primarily on its judgment using historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer as evidence supporting the receivables valuations stated on the Company\u2019s financial statements. However, the Company\u2019s receivables valuation estimates may not be accurate and receivables due from customers reflected in its financial statements may not be collectible. The Company\u2019s inability to perform under its contractual obligations, or its customers\u2019 inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments to the Company, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company participates in joint ventures, and its investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by its lack of sole decision-making authority and disputes between its partners and itself.\nThe Company participates in domestic and international joint ventures to further expand its capabilities, share risks and gain access to local markets. Due to the nature of joint venture arrangements, the Company does not unilaterally control the operating, strategic and financial policies of these business ventures. Decisions are often made on a collective basis, including the purchase and sale of assets, charter arrangements with customers and management of cash, including cash distributions to partners. In addition, joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions, which could lead to deadlock in the operations or strategy with respect to the joint venture or partnership. Decisions made by the managers or the governing bodies of these entities may not always be the decision that is most beneficial to the Company as one of the equity holders of the entity, may be contrary to the Company\u2019s objectives, and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to transfer its interests. Investments in joint ventures involve risks that would not be present were a third-party not involved, including the possibility that the Company\u2019s co-ventures might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to the Company or to third-parties, or any disputes with respect to the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s participation in industry-wide, multi-employer, defined benefit pension plans expose it to potential future losses.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are participating employers in two industry-wide, multi-employer defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., namely, the U.K. Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (\u201cMNOPF\u201d) and the U.K. Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (\u201cMNRPF\u201d). Among other risks associated with multi-employer plans, contributions and unfunded obligations of the multi-employer plan are shared by the plan participants. As a result, the Company may inherit unfunded obligations if other plan participants withdraw from the plan or cease to participate, and in the event that the Company withdraws from participation in one or both of these plans, it may be required to pay the plan an amount based on its allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan. Depending on the results of future actuarial valuations, it is possible that the plans could experience further deficits that will require funding from the Company, which would negatively impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, on October 19, 2021, the Company was informed by the MNRPF that two issues had been identified during a review of the MNRPF by the applicable trustee that would potentially give rise to material additional liabilities for the MNRPF. The MNRPF has indicated that the investigations into these issues remain ongoing, and that further updates will be provided as significant developments arise. Should such additional liabilities require the MNRPF to collect additional funds from participating employers, it is possible that the Company will be invoiced for a portion of such funds and recognize payroll related operating expenses in the periods invoices are received.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s ongoing management of its fleet and personnel, the Company may need to improve its operations and financial systems and recruit additional staff and crew\u037e if the Company cannot improve these systems or recruit suitable employees, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company has and may continue to need to invest in upgrading its operating and financial systems. In addition, the Company may have to recruit additional well-qualified seafarers and shoreside administrative and management personnel. The Company may not be able to hire suitable employees. For example, the Company\u2019s vessels require technically skilled staff with specialized training. If the Company is unable to employ such technically skilled staff, they may not be able to adequately staff the Company\u2019s vessels. If the Company is unable to operate its financial and operations systems effectively or is unable to recruit suitable employees, the Company\u2019s results of operation and its ability to manage and expand its fleet may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel and crew its vessels could have an adverse effect on its business.\nAttracting and retaining skilled personnel is an important factor in the Company\u2019s future success. In addition, the success of the Company is dependent upon its ability to adequately crew its vessels. The market for qualified personnel is highly competitive, particularly in the last few months, and global and/or regional conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may further reduce or restrict the availability of qualified personnel, particularly with respect to certain technical and engineering positions, including marine officers.\nThe Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel and crewing its vessels in the future. We have faced and may continue to face difficulties attracting, hiring and retaining highly-skilled personnel and with appropriate qualifications and may not be able to fill positions. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. We have increased, and expect to continue to increase, our employee compensation levels in response to competition, as necessary. In addition, the pressures of inflation have increased our costs of labor and may continue to do so. Many of the companies with which we compete for personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do. If the Company fails to retain key personnel and hire, train and retain qualified employees, the Company may not be able to compete effectively and may have increased incident rates as well as regulatory and other compliance failures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s employees are covered by federal laws that may subject it to job-related claims in addition to those provided by state laws.\nSome of the Company\u2019s employees are covered by provisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act and general maritime law. These laws preempt state workers\u2019 compensation laws and permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job-related incidents in federal courts based on tort theories. Because the Company is not generally protected by the damage limits imposed by state workers\u2019 compensation statutes for these types of claims, it may have greater exposure for any claims made by these employees.\nThe Company relies on information technology, and if it is unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted and its business could be negatively affected.\nThe Company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and cloud services, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, manage a variety of business processes and activities, and comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. The Company also depends on its information technology infrastructure to capture knowledge of its business including its vessel operation systems containing information about vessel positioning and scheduling; to monitor its vessel maintenance and engine systems; to coordinate its business across its bases of operation including cargo delivery and equipment tracking; and to communicate within its organization and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties. The Company\u2019s ability to service customers and operate vessels is dependent on the continued operation of these systems. While the Company takes various precautions and has enhanced controls around its systems, like other technology systems, they are susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, hardware or software failures, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events, or cyber-attacks including malware, other malicious software, phishing email attacks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to its data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of its data, loss or damage to its data delivery systems, ransomware, and other electronic security breaches. Overtime, these attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and, in some cases, have been conducted or sponsored by \u201cnation state\u201d operators.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems are in some cases integrated, such that damage, disruption or shutdown to the system could result in a more widespread impact. If the Company\u2019s information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and its business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s operations could be disrupted and its business could be negatively affected. In addition, cyber-attacks could lead to potential unauthorized access and disclosure of confidential information, data loss and corruption. While we are not currently aware of any material impact from recent attacks such as SolarWinds, Log4j, and Kaseya, new information on the scope of such attacks is continuing to emerge. While we continue to devote time and resources on the remediation of such risks, there is the possibility of a material impact from such an attack in the future.\nRecent action by the IMO\u2019s Maritime Safety Committee and U.S. agencies indicate that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. The Company is unable to predict the impact of such regulations at this time. Further, as the threat of cyber-attacks continues to grow, the Company will be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. The Company has adopted flag-state vessel security plans to comply with the IMO regulations that went into effect in 2021.\nFurther, data protection laws apply to the Company in certain countries in which the Company does business. Specifically, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), increased penalties up to a maximum of 4% of global annual turnover for breach of the regulation. The GDPR requires mandatory breach notification, the standard for which is also followed outside the E.U., particularly in Asia. Non-compliance with data protection laws could expose the Company to regulatory investigations, which could result in fines and penalties. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. The Company could also be subject to litigation from persons or corporations allegedly affected by data protection violations. Violation of data protection laws is a criminal offence in some countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. Any violation of these laws or harm to the Company\u2019s reputation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nRisk Factors Related to the Company\u2019s Spin-off\nSEACOR Marine was previously a subsidiary of SEACOR Holdings Inc. (along with its consolidated subsidiaries, other than SEACOR Marine, collectively referred to as \u201cSEACOR Holdings\u201d). On June 1, 2017, SEACOR Holdings completed a spin-off of SEACOR Marine by way of a pro rata dividend of SEACOR Marine\u2019s Common Stock, all of which was then held by SEACOR Holdings, to SEACOR Holdings\u2019 shareholders of record as of May 22, 2017 (the \u201cSpin-off\u201d).\nIf there is a determination that the Spin-off was taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the tax opinion were incorrect or for any other reason, then SEACOR Holdings, its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and SEACOR Marine could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, SEACOR Holdings received an opinion of its counsel, Milbank LLP (f/k/a Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP), substantially to the effect that the Spin-off qualifies as a transaction that is described in Section 355 of the Code. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from SEACOR Holdings and the Company regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect, SEACOR Holdings and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Services (\"IRS\") could determine on audit that the Spin-off was taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were not correct or had been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of SEACOR Holdings or SEACOR Marine after the Spin-off. If the Spin-off is determined to be taxable, SEACOR Holdings, its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the Company could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nPrior to the Spin-off, the Company and SEACOR Holdings entered into the Tax Matters Agreement that governs the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters. Taxes relating to or arising out of the failure of the Spin-off to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes are the responsibility of SEACOR Holdings, except, in general, if such failure is attributable to the Company\u2019s action or inaction or SEACOR Holdings\u2019 action or inaction.\nThe Company\u2019s obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. Further, even if the Company is not responsible for tax liabilities of SEACOR Holdings and its subsidiaries under the Tax Matters Agreement, the Company nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if SEACOR Holdings were to fail to pay them. If the Company is required to pay any liabilities under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law, the amounts may be significant.\nRisk Factors Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly, and investors may not be able to sell their shares at an attractive price.\nThe trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors including:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s capital structure and liquidity;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices and in particular prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s quarterly financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new equipment or services by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\npurchases and sales of large blocks of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and the frequency and volume with which the Common Stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\noil and natural gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nregulatory or political developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022\nchanging economic conditions.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for the Company\u2019s Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of the Company\u2019s stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against it, the Company could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of the Company\u2019s management from its business.\nAn investor\u2019s percentage of ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any publicly traded company, an investor\u2019s percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that the Company has and will continue to grant to its directors, officers and employees. For instance, in April 2018, the Company issued 2,168,586 shares of Common Stock, and warrants to purchase 674,164 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $0.01 per share (the \u201cWarrants\u201d), in a private placement for cash, in January 2019, the Company issued 603,872 shares of Common Stock in a private placement to purchase three FSVs; in March 2020, the Company issued 900,000 shares of Common Stock in a private placement to purchase the remaining 28% minority equity interests in Falcon Global Holdings LLC (\u201cFalcon Global Holdings\u201d) that the Company did not already own; and in December 2021, the Company issued 1,567,935 shares of Common Stock as merger and related consideration to purchase the remaining equity and subordinated debt interests in SEACOR OSV Partners I LP that the Company did not already own. In addition, an investor\u2019s percentage ownership in the Company will be diluted if any of the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes exercise their right to convert the principal amount of their outstanding notes, in whole or in part, into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes are entitled to convert the principal amount of their outstanding notes into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock (or, if required to maintain Jones Act compliance, warrants to purchase such stock for $0.01) at a conversion rate of 23.26 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes through November 29, 2023. The Company has granted the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes certain registration rights to assist them with the sale of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such notes. Any substantial issuance of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, including Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, could significantly affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about the Company\u2019s business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the Company\u2019s stock or if the Company\u2019s results of operations do not meet their expectations, the Company\u2019s stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s Common Stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about the Company or its business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to publish reports on the Company regularly, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover the Company downgrade recommendations regarding the Company\u2019s stock, or if the Company\u2019s results of operations do not meet their expectations, the Company\u2019s stock price could decline and such decline could be material.\nFor as long as the Company is an \u201cEmerging Growth Company,\u201d it will be exempt from certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about its executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d) was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for \u201cEmerging Growth Companies,\u201d including certain requirements relating to accounting standards and compensation disclosure. The Company is classified as an \u201cEmerging Growth Company,\u201d which is defined as a company with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion, that has been a public reporting company for a period of less than five years, and that does not have a public float of $700 million or more in securities held by non-affiliated holders. The Company will lose its status as an Emerging Growth Company on December 31, 2022, and therefore it is not required to (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, (iii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), such as requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (iv) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, (v) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or (vi) hold stockholder advisory and other votes on executive compensation. The Company cannot predict if investors will find its Common Stock less attractive if it chooses to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Company\u2019s Common Stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s Common Stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nAs noted above, under the JOBS Act, \u201cEmerging Growth Companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company elected not to take advantage of such extended transition period, which election is irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nThe Company is obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and is subject to other requirements that will be burdensome and costly.\nThe Company is subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon the Company. As a public company, the Company is required to:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with its obligations under the federal securities laws and NYSE rules;\n\u2022\ncreate or expand the roles and duties of its board of directors and committees of the board of directors;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions;\n\u2022\nsupplement its internal accounting and auditing function, including hiring additional staff with expertise in accounting and financial reporting for a public company;\n\u2022\nenhance and formalize closing procedures at the end of the Company\u2019s accounting periods;\n\u2022\nenhance the Company\u2019s internal audit function;\n\u2022\nenhance the Company\u2019s investor relations function;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, including those relating to disclosure controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above.\nThese changes require a significant commitment of additional resources, including increased auditing and legal fees and costs associated with hiring additional accounting and administrative staff. The Company may not be successful in fully and efficiently implementing these requirements and implementing them could materially adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s internal controls were initially developed when it was a subsidiary of SEACOR Holdings. However, section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d) requires the Company to establish effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Section 404 and to assess the effectiveness of such controls beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, it may be unable to report its financial information on a timely basis, may violate applicable stock exchange listing rules or suffer other adverse regulatory consequences and may breach the covenants under its credit facilities. There could also be a negative reaction in the price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock due to a loss of investor confidence in the Company and the reliability of its financial statements. It cannot be assumed that the Company will not have another material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting in the future.\nMoreover, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in the Company\u2019s financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated By-Laws, and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in the Company\u2019s management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of its Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated By-Laws include certain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or changes in its management, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nrestrictions related to the ability of non-U.S. citizens owning the Company\u2019s Common Stock;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the Board of Directors may determine, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors which may limit the ability of minority stockholders to elect directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect a particular slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions in the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated By-Laws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company that is in the best interest of its stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nThe Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated By-Laws include a forum selection clause, which could limit the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated By-Laws require that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims under the Exchange Act, but will apply to other state and federal law claims including actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (although the Company\u2019s stockholders will not be deemed to have waived the Company\u2019s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder). Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, however, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933 or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This forum selection provision in the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated By-Laws may limit the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated By-Laws, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThe Company does not expect to pay dividends to holders of its Common Stock.\nThe Company currently intends to retain its future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to repay indebtedness and to fund the development and growth of its business. The Company does not intend to pay any dividends to holders of its Common Stock. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, if any, will be investor's only source of gain or income on an investment in the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nDifficult economic conditions and volatility in the capital markets could materially adversely affect the Company.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world that are outside the Company\u2019s control and are difficult to predict. Factors such as global and/or regional conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, pandemic responses, commodity prices and demand for commodities, interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation, such as amendments to provisions of the CARES Act that permit us to carryback NOLs not permitted prior to adoption of the act), trade barriers, currency exchange rates and controls, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts, security operations or pandemics) can have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and investments, which could reduce its revenues and profitability. Uncertainty about global economic conditions may cause or require businesses to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values and to cancel or renegotiate existing contracts because their access to capital is impeded. This would in turn affect the Company\u2019s profitability or results of operations. These factors may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial conditions of its customers. Volatility in the conditions of the global economic markets can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital at attractive prices. The Company\u2019s ongoing exposure to credit risks on its accounts receivable balances are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company has procedures that are designed to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its receivables, however, there can be no assurance that such procedures will effectively limit the Company\u2019s credit risk and avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Unstable economic conditions may also increase the volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks.\nThe Company is exposed to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks and, although some of these risks may be hedged, fluctuations could impact its financial position and its results of operations. The Company has, and anticipates that it will continue to have, contracts denominated in foreign currencies. It is often not practicable for the Company to effectively hedge the entire risk of significant changes in currency rates during a contract period. The Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been negatively impacted for certain periods and positively impacted for other periods, and may continue to be affected to a material extent by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For example, strengthening of the U.S. dollar could give rise to reduced prices from shipyards and incentivize additional investment in new equipment notwithstanding the current state of such market. The Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows may also be affected by the cost of hedging activities that it undertakes. Volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty also increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on the Company\u2019s debt and equity instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. In addition, changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Specifically, rising interest rates, including a potential rapid rise in interest rates, could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital.\nThe Company engages in hedging activities which exposes it to risks.\nFor corporate purposes, the Company has in the past and may in the future use futures and swaps to hedge risks, such as escalation in fuel costs and movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Such activities can themselves result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. The Company may also purchase inventory in larger than usual levels to lock in costs when it believes there may be large increases in the price of raw materials or other material used in its business. Such purchases expose the Company to risks of meeting margin calls and drawing on its capital, counter-party risk due to failure of an exchange or institution with which it has entered into a swap, incurring higher costs than competitors or similar businesses that do not engage in such strategies, and losses on its investment portfolio. Such strategies can also cause earnings to be volatile. If the Company fails to offset such volatility, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s results could be impacted by U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions as well as by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government.\nChanges in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade (including the U.S. trade agreements and U.S. tariff policies), travel to and from the U.S., immigration, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries in which the Company operates, and any negative sentiments or retaliatory actions towards the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the global marine and support transportation services industry. Recent changes in U.S. foreign policy have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and China, as well as with other countries, including with respect to the trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade between the U.S. and other nations. Changes in these policies may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nA violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or similar worldwide anti-bribery laws may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nIn order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, the Company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners. As a U.S. corporation, the Company is subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. The Company has stringent policies and procedures in place to enforce compliance with the FCPA. Nevertheless, the Company does business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary and the Company may be held liable for actions taken by its strategic or local partners even though these partners may not be subject to the FCPA. The Company\u2019s personnel and intermediaries, including its local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which it operates or may operate in the future. As a result, the Company faces the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of its employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to the Company\u2019s control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which the Company may be subject. Any allegation or determination that the Company has violated the FCPA (or any other applicable anti-bribery laws in countries in which the Company does business, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010) could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company is subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of its business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. The Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects should it fail to prevail in certain matters.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact the Company.\nMedia coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by the Company, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and the morale of its employees, which could materially adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on key members of its management, the loss of whom could disrupt its business operations.\nThe Company depends to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of its executive officers and key management personnel. It does not maintain key-man insurance. The loss of services of one or more of its executive officers or key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.", "PERMNO": 16737, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "SMHI"}
