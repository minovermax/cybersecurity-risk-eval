{"cik": "107140", "company": "JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all the information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of our securities. The risks below are the most significant risks we face but are not the only risk factors we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem insignificant could impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Our business consolidated financial position, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment.\nThe recent global coronavirus outbreak may continue to harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious outbreak and the related adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours.\nThis outbreak, as well as lockdown measures undertaken to contain the spread of COVID-19, caused disruptions and had a significant impact on our business, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndeclines in print book sales due to indefinite closings of retail bookstores and the temporary prioritization of essential goods by online retailers;\n\u2022\ndeclines in businesses that rely on in-person engagement, primarily test prep and corporate training;\n\u2022\ndelays in signing annual journal subscription agreements in certain parts of Europe and Asia due to challenges of remote selling and university disruption;\n\u2022\ndelays in customer payments due to widespread disruption and pervasive cash conservation behaviors in the face of uncertainty;\n\u2022\nreduced student demand for continuing education which impacted our undergraduate and masters online program management programs, due to funding constraints related to loss of employment and/or lack of interest in pursuing education during a period of uncertainty; and\n\u2022\nlower demand for early career technology talent due to client constraints including, the closure of corporate offices, staffing uncertainty, internal contractor hiring restrictions or financial constraints.\nThe outbreak also presents challenges as the majority of our workforce is currently working remotely and shifting to assisting new and existing customers who are also generally working remotely.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty the degree to which the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and reactions thereto will continue.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of heightening other risks identified in this section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2020, such as those related to technology disruption and the adoption by colleges and universities of online delivery of their educational offerings. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse impacts of the outbreak and its effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition at this time, but such effects may be material.\nIndex\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock may fluctuate materially, and investors of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price may fluctuate materially. The stock market in general has experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our consolidated operating results;\n\u2022\nvariances between actual consolidated operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in our industry, the stock market or the economy;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our stock, the stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022\nannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022\ncapital commitments;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of the Company and our business;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders.\nOur company is highly dependent on information technology systems and their business management and customer-facing capabilities critical for the long-term competitive sustainability of the business. These capabilities include business planning and transaction information, product development and delivery, marketing and sales information and management, and system security.\nWe must continue to invest in technology and other innovations to adapt and add value to our products and services to remain competitive. This is particularly true in the current environment, where investment in new technology is ongoing and there are rapid changes in the products competitors are offering, the products our customers are seeking, and our sales and distribution channels. In some cases, investments will take the form of internal development; in others, they may take the form of an acquisition. There are uncertainties whenever developing or acquiring new products and services, and it is often possible that such new products and services may not be launched, or, if launched, may not be profitable or as profitable as existing products and services. If we are unable to introduce new technologies, products, and services, our ability to be profitable may be adversely affected.\nThe demand for digital and lower cost books could impact our sales volumes and pricing in an adverse way.\nA common trend facing each of our businesses is the digitization of content and proliferation of distribution channels through the internet and other electronic means, which are replacing traditional print formats. The trend to digital content has also created contraction in the print book retail market which increases the risk of bankruptcy for certain retail customers, potentially leading to the disruption of short-term product supply to consumers, as well as potential bad debt write-offs. New distribution channels, such as digital formats, the internet, online retailers, and growing delivery platforms (e.g. tablets and e-readers), combined with the concentration of retailer power, present both risks and opportunities to our traditional publishing models, potentially impacting both sales volumes and pricing.\nAs the market has shifted to digital products, customer expectations for lower-priced products have increased due to customer awareness of reductions in production costs and the availability of free or low-cost digital content and products. As a result, there has been pressure to sell digital versions of products at prices below their print versions. Increased customer demand for lower prices could reduce our revenue.\nWe publish educational content for undergraduate, graduate, and advanced placement students, lifelong learners, and in Australia, for secondary school students. Due to growing student demand for less expensive textbooks, many college bookstores, online retailers and other entities offer used or rental textbooks to students at lower prices than new textbooks. The internet has made the used and rental textbook markets more efficient and has significantly increased student access to used and rental books. Further expansion of the used and rental book markets could further adversely affect our sales of print textbooks, subsequently affecting our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIndex\nAdverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nOur professional customers worldwide rely upon many of our publications to perform their jobs. It is imperative that we consistently demonstrate our ability to maintain the integrity of the information included in our publications. Adverse publicity, whether valid or not, may reduce demand for our publications and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be protected, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our publications are protected by copyright, held either in our name, in the name of the author of the work, or in the name of a sponsoring professional society. Such copyrights protect our exclusive right to publish the work in many countries abroad for specified periods, in most cases, the author\u2019s life plus 70 years, but in any event, a minimum of 50 years for works published after 1978. Our ability to continue to achieve our expected results depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. Our consolidated financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected by lack of legal and/or technological protections for its intellectual property in some jurisdictions and markets.\nA reduction in enrollment at colleges and universities could adversely affect the demand for our higher education products.\nEnrollment in U.S. colleges and universities can be adversely affected by many factors, including changes in government and private student loan and grant programs, uncertainty about current and future economic conditions, increases in tuition, general decreases in family income and net worth, and a perception of uncertain job prospects for graduates. In addition, enrollment levels at colleges and universities outside the United States are influenced by global and local economic factors, local political conditions, and other factors that make predicting foreign enrollment levels difficult. Reductions in expected levels of enrollment at colleges and universities both within and outside the United States could adversely affect demand for our higher education products, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn our journal publishing business we have a trade concentration and credit risk related to subscription agents, and in our book business the industry has a concentration of customers in national, regional, and online bookstore chains. Changes in the financial position and liquidity of our subscription agents and customers, could adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn the journal publishing business, subscriptions are primarily sourced through journal subscription agents who, acting as agents for library customers, facilitate ordering by consolidating the subscription orders/billings of each subscriber with various publishers. Cash is generally collected in advance from subscribers by the subscription agents and is principally remitted to us between the months of December and April. Although at fiscal year-end we had minimal credit risk exposure to these agents, future calendar-year subscription receipts from these agents are highly dependent on their financial condition and liquidity.\nSubscription agents account for approximately 20% of total annual consolidated revenue and one affiliated group of subscription agents accounts for approximately 10% of total annual consolidated revenue.\nOur book business is not dependent upon a single customer; however, the industry is concentrated in national, regional, and online bookstore chains. Although no book customer accounts for more than 8% of total consolidated revenue and 9% of accounts receivable at April 30, 2020, the top 10 book customers account for approximately 12% of total consolidated revenue and approximately 18% of accounts receivable at April 30, 2020. We maintain approximately $20 million of trade credit insurance, covering balances due from certain named customers, subject to certain limitations and annual renewal.\nA disruption or loss of data sources could limit our collection and use of certain kinds of information, which could adversely impact our communication with our customers.\nSeveral of our businesses rely extensively upon content and data from external sources. Data is obtained from public records, governmental authorities, customers and other information companies, including competitors. Legal regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), relating to internet communications, privacy and data protection, e-commerce, information governance, and use of public records, are becoming more prevalent worldwide. The disruption or loss of data sources, either because of changes in the law or because data suppliers decide not to supply them, may impose limits on our collection and use of certain kinds of information about individuals and our ability to communicate such information effectively with our customers. In addition, GDPR imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater.\nIndex\nIf we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel, our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company and industry are highly dependent on the loyal engagement of key management leaders and professional staff. Loss of staff due to inadequate skills and career path development or maintaining competitive salaries and benefits could have significant impact on Company performance.\nWe have a significant investment in our employees around the world. We offer competitive salaries and benefits in order to attract and retain the highly skilled workforce needed to sustain and develop new products and services required for growth. Employment costs are affected by competitive market conditions for qualified individuals, and factors such as healthcare and retirement benefit costs.\nWe are highly dependent on the continued services of key employees who have in-depth market and business knowledge and/or key relationships with business partners. The loss of the services of key personnel for any reason and our inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, and results of operation.\nChanges in pension costs and related funding requirements may impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees worldwide. Our Board of Directors approved amendments to the U.S., Canada and U.K. defined benefit plans that froze the future accumulation of benefits effective June 30, 2013, December 31, 2015, and April 30, 2015, respectively. The funding requirements and costs of these plans are dependent upon various factors, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics, and changes in pension regulations. Changes in these factors affect our plan funding, consolidated financial position, and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated cost savings and benefits from, or our business may be disrupted by, our business transformation and restructuring efforts.\nWe continue to transform our business from a traditional publishing model to a global provider of content-enabled solutions with a focus on digital products and services. We have made several acquisitions over the past few years that represent examples of strategic initiatives that were implemented as part of our business transformation. We will continue to explore opportunities to develop new business models and enhance the efficiency of our organizational structure. The rapid pace and scope of change increases the risk that not all our strategic initiatives will deliver the expected benefits within the anticipated timeframes. In addition, these efforts may somewhat disrupt our business activities, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe continue to restructure and realign our cost base with current and anticipated future market conditions. Significant risks associated with these actions that may impair our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings or that may disrupt our business include delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the U.S., decreases in employee morale, the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of key employees, and disruptions of third parties to whom we have outsourced business functions. In addition, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and consolidated financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not realize the anticipated cost savings and processing efficiencies associated with the outsourcing of certain business processes.\nWe have outsourced certain business functions, principally in technology, content management, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, fulfillment, distribution, returns processing, and certain other transactional processing functions, to third-party service providers to achieve cost savings, and efficiencies. If these third-party service providers do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated cost savings, and depending on the function involved, we may experience business disruption or processing inefficiencies, all with potential adverse effects on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIndex\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our growth strategies, including successfully integrating acquisitions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nOur growth strategy includes title, imprint, and other business acquisitions, including knowledge-enabled services, which complement our existing businesses. Acquisitions may have a substantial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in integrating acquired operations and in realizing expected opportunities, cost synergies, diversions of management resources, and loss of key employees, challenges with respect to operating new businesses, and other uncertainties.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we have and may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of these assets.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademarks and developed technologies. At April 30, 2020, we had $1,116.8 million of goodwill and $807.4 million of intangible assets, of which $121.3 million are indefinite-lived intangible assets, on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The intangible assets are principally composed of content and publishing rights, customer relationships, brands and trademarks and developed technology. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections could result in an asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to our consolidated results of operations. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with definite lives, which were $686.1 million at April 30, 2020, are tested for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment exists can be difficult as a result of increased uncertainty and current market dynamics and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments. A non-cash intangible asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. See Note 11, \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d for further information related to goodwill and intangible assets, and the impairment charges recorded in the year ended April 30, 2020.\nWe may be susceptible to information technology risks that may adversely impact our business, consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nInformation technology is a key part of our business strategy and operations. As a business strategy, Wiley\u2019s technology enables us to provide customers with new and enhanced products and services and is critical to our success in migrating from print to digital business models. Information technology is also a fundamental component of all our business processes, collecting and reporting business data, and communicating internally and externally with customers, suppliers, employees, and others.\nOur business is dependent on information technology systems to support our businesses. We provide internet-based products and services to our customers. We also use complex information technology systems and products to support our business activities, particularly in infrastructure, and as we move our products and services to an increasingly digital delivery platform.\nWe face technological risks associated with internet-based product and service delivery in our businesses, including with respect to information technology capability, reliability and security, enterprise resource planning, system implementations and upgrades. Failures of our information technology systems and products (including because of operational failure, natural disaster, computer virus, or hacker attacks) could interrupt the availability of our internet-based products and services, result in corruption or loss of data or breach in security, and result in liability or reputational damage to our brands and/or adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nManagement has designed and implemented policies, processes and controls to mitigate risks of information technology failure and to provide security from unauthorized access to our systems. In addition, we have disaster recovery plans in place to maintain business continuity. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks common to most industries from inadvertent or intentional actions by employees, vendors, or malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives. While we have taken steps to address these risks, there can be no assurance that a system failure, disruption, or data security breach would not adversely affect our business and could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIndex\nWe are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. We are in the process of implementing a new global Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our operational and financial systems and processes. We have completed the implementation of record-to-report, purchase-to-pay, and several other business processes within all locations through fiscal year 2017. We completed the implementation of order-to-cash for certain businesses in May 2018 and may continue to roll out additional processes and functionality of the ERP system in phases in the foreseeable future. Implementation of a new ERP system involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design or implementation of a new system could result in increased costs, disruptions in operations, or delays in the collection of cash from our customers, as well as having an adverse effect on our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nChallenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets has a higher risk due to political instability, economic volatility, crime, terrorism, corruption, social and ethnic unrest, and other factors, which may adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe sell our products to customers in certain sanctioned and previously sanctioned developing markets where we do not have operating subsidiaries. We do not own any assets or liabilities in these markets except for trade receivables. In the year ended April 30, 2020, we recorded an immaterial amount of revenue and net earnings related to sales to Cuba, Sudan, Syria and Iran. While sales in these markets are not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations, adverse developments related to the risks associated with these markets may cause actual results to differ from historical and forecasted future consolidated operating results.\nWe have certain technology development operations in Russia and Sri Lanka related to software development and architecture, digital content production, and system testing services. Due to the political instability within these regions, there is the potential for future government embargos and sanctions, which could disrupt our operations in this area. While we have developed business continuity plans to address these issues, further adverse developments in the region could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nApproximately 22% of Research journal articles are sourced from authors in China. Any restrictions on exporting intellectual property could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may require us to incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to further expand our accounting and finance functions and expend significant management efforts.\nWe may in the future discover material weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to errors or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nIndex\nThe competitive pressures we face in our business, as well as our ability to retain our business relationships with our authors and professional societies, could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nThe contribution of authors and their professional societies is one of the more important elements of the highly competitive elements of the publishing business. We operate in highly competitive markets. Success and continued growth depend greatly on developing new products and the means to deliver them in an environment of rapid technological change. Attracting new authors and professional societies while retaining our existing business relationships is critical to our success. If we are unable to retain our existing business relationships with authors and professional societies, this could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in laws, tariffs, and regulations, including regulations related to open access, could adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe maintain operations in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The conduct of our business, including the sourcing of content, distribution, sales, marketing, and advertising, is subject to various laws and regulations administered by governments around the world. Changes in laws, regulations, or government policies, including tax regulations and accounting standards, may adversely affect our future consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nThe scientific research publishing industry generates much of its revenue from paid customer subscriptions to online and print journal content. There is debate within government, academic, and library communities whether such journal content should be made available for free, immediately or following a period of embargo after publication, referred to as \u201copen access,\u201d For instance, certain governments and privately held funding bodies have implemented mandates that require journal articles derived from government-funded research to be made available to the public at no cost after an embargo period. Open access can be achieved in two ways: Green, which enables authors to publish articles in subscription based journals and self-archive the author accepted version of the article for free public use after an embargo period, and Gold, which enables authors to publish their articles in journals that provide immediate free access to the final version of the article on the publisher\u2019s Web site, and elsewhere under permissive licensing terms, following payment of an APC. These mandates have the potential to put pressure on subscription-based publications. If such regulations are widely implemented, our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo date, the majority of governments that have taken a position on open access have favored the green model and have generally specified embargo periods of twelve months. The publishing community generally takes the view that this period should be sufficient to protect subscription revenues, provided that publishers\u2019 platforms offer sufficient added value to the article. Governments in Europe have been more supportive of the gold model, which thus far is generating incremental revenue for publishers with active open access programs. Several European administrations are showing interest in a business model which combines the purchasing of subscription content with the purchase of open access publishing for authors in their country. This development removes an element of risk by fixing revenues from that market, provided that the terms, price, and rate of transition negotiated are acceptable.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit may cause increased economic volatility, affecting our operations and business.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) exited the European Union (referred to as \"Brexit\"). The UK has agreed to abide by EU rules during a transition period until the end of 2020, at which point the European Union and the UK expect to have agreements in place regarding future ties including trade, customs, commerce and travel.\nA withdrawal without a trade agreement in place could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K. and the European Union, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. Additional Brexit-related impacts on our business could include potential inventory shortages in the U.K., increased regulatory burdens and costs to comply with U.K.-specific regulations and higher transportation costs for our products coming into and out of the U.K. Any of these effects, among others, could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks and hackers are becoming more sophisticated and pervasive. Our business is dependent on information technology systems to support our businesses. We provide internet-based products and services to our customers. We also use complex information technology systems and products to support our business activities, particularly in infrastructure and as we move our products and services to an increasingly digital delivery platform. Across our businesses, we hold personal data, including that of employees and customers.\nIndex\nEfforts to prevent cyber-attacks and hackers from entering our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our systems. Individuals may try to gain unauthorized access to our systems and data for malicious purposes, and our security measures may fail to prevent such unauthorized access. Cyber-attacks and/or intentional hacking of our systems could adversely affect the performance or availability of our products, result in loss of customer data, adversely affect our ability to conduct business, or result in theft of our funds or proprietary information, the occurrence of which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-U.S. revenues, as well as our substantial non-U.S. net assets, expose our consolidated results to volatility from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Non-U.S. dollar revenues accounted for 44% of our total consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2020, which primarily includes revenues in British pound sterling of 26% and euro of 10%. In addition, our interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates. These risks and the measures we have taken to help mitigate them are discussed in Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may, from time-to-time, use derivative instruments to hedge such risks. Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external market or fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, inflation, or other related factors affecting our business, consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to mitigate the impact of inflation and cost increases, which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we experience cost increases reflecting, in part, general inflationary factors. There is no guarantee that we can increase selling prices or reduce costs to fully mitigate the effect of inflation on our costs, which may adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws, including regulations and other guidance in connection with the U.S. Federal tax legislation originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to tax laws within the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. In addition to the Tax Act in the U.S., changes in tax laws and interpretations in other jurisdictions where we do business, such as the U.K. and Germany, could significantly impact the taxation of our non-U.S. earnings. We are also subject to potential taxes and regulations in jurisdictions where we have sales even though we do not have a physical presence. These taxes and potential taxes could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations as most of our income is earned outside the U.S. In addition, we are subject to audit by tax authorities and are regularly audited by various tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in global economic conditions could impact our ability to borrow funds and meet our future financing needs.\nChanges in global financial markets have not had, nor do we anticipate they will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our significant operating cash flow, financial assets, access to capital markets, and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. As market conditions change, we will continue to monitor our liquidity position. However, there can be no assurance that our liquidity or our consolidated financial position and results of operations will not be adversely affected by possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions. Unprecedented market conditions including illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency rates, and economic recession could affect future results.", "PERMNO": 82932, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "JW.A"}
