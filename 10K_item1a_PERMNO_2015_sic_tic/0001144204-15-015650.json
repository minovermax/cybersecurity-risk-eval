{"cik": "714530", "company": "NEWBRIDGE BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent in the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on, or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nFinancial reform legislation enacted by Congress and resulting regulations have increased, and are expected to continue to increase our costs of operations. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. This law has significantly changed the structure of the bank regulatory system and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations. Although many of these regulations have been promulgated, additional regulations are expected to be issued in 2015 and thereafter. Consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. This significant change to existing law has already had an adverse effect on our interest expense.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments, and authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company\u2019s proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. It also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nIt is difficult to quantify what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations have had on the Company to date and what impact yet to be written regulations will have on us in the future. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and oversight, and, depending upon the findings and determinations of our regulatory authorities, we may be required to make adjustments to our business, operations or financial position and could become subject to formal or informal regulatory action. We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, including examination by federal and state banking regulators. Federal and state regulators have the ability to impose substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements on us if they determine, upon conclusion of their examination or otherwise, violations of laws with which we must comply or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, including, for example, in respect of any financial concerns that the regulators may identify and desire for us to address. Such enforcement may be formal or informal and can include directors\u2019 resolutions, memoranda of understanding, consent orders, civil money penalties and termination of deposit insurance and bank closure. Enforcement actions may be taken regardless of the capital levels of the institutions, and regardless of prior examination findings. In particular, institutions that are not sufficiently capitalized in accordance with regulatory standards may also face capital directives or prompt corrective actions. Enforcement actions may require certain corrective steps (including staff additions or changes), impose limits on activities (such as lending, deposit taking, acquisitions, paying dividends or branching), prescribe lending parameters (such as loan types, volumes and terms) and require additional capital to be raised, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The imposition of regulatory sanctions, including monetary penalties, may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and/or damage our reputation. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management\u2019s attention from our operations, cause us to incur significant expenses, restrict us from engaging in potentially profitable activities and limit our ability to raise capital.\nThe Company will become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and revises the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital requirements will be: (i) a new common equity Tier I capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier I to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier I leverage ratio of 4%. These rules also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier I capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier I to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nThe Company may need additional access to capital, which it may be unable to obtain on attractive terms or at all. We may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments, for future growth or to fund losses or additional provision for loan losses in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to it, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our stock price negatively affected.\nIf the Bank loses key employees with significant business contacts in its market areas, its business may suffer. The Bank\u2019s success is largely dependent on the personal contacts of our officers and employees in its market areas. If the Bank loses key employees temporarily or permanently, this could have a material adverse effect on the business. The Bank could be particularly affected if its key employees go to work for competitors. The Bank\u2019s future success depends on the continued contributions of its existing senior management personnel, many of whom have significant local experience and contacts in its market areas. The Bank has employment agreements or non-competition agreements with several of its senior and executive officers in an attempt to partially mitigate this risk.\nThe Company may not be able to implement aspects of its growth strategy. The Company\u2019s growth strategy contemplates the future expansion of its business and operations both organically and by selective acquisitions of banks and the establishment of banking offices in its market areas and other markets in the Carolinas and Virginia. Implementing these aspects of the Company\u2019s growth strategy depends, in part, on its ability to successfully identify acquisition opportunities and strategic partners that will complement its operating philosophy and to successfully integrate their operations with those of the Company, as well as generate loans and deposits of acceptable risk and expense. To successfully acquire or establish banks or banking offices, the Company must be able to correctly identify profitable or growing markets, as well as attract the necessary relationships and high caliber banking personnel to make these new banking offices profitable. In addition, the Company may not be able to identify suitable opportunities for further growth and expansion or, if it does, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate these new operations into its business.\nAs consolidation of the financial services industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase. The Company will compete with other financial services companies for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company does and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than the Company is able or willing to pay.\nThe Company can offer no assurance that it will have opportunities to acquire other financial institutions or acquire or establish any new branches or loan production offices, or that it will be able to negotiate, finance and complete any opportunities available to it.\nIf the Company is unable to effectively implement its growth strategies, its business, results of operations and stock price may be materially and adversely affected.\nFuture expansion involves risks. The acquisition by the Company of other financial institutions or parts of those institutions, or the establishment of de novo branch offices and loan production offices, involves a number of risks, including the risk that:\n\u00b7 The Company may incur substantial costs in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners, or in evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local managers, and opening new offices;\n\u00b7 The Company\u2019s estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks relating to target institutions may not be accurate;\n\u00b7 The institutions the Company acquires may have distressed assets and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to realize the value it predicts from those assets or that it will make sufficient provisions or have sufficient capital for future losses;\n\u00b7 The Company may be required to take writedowns or writeoffs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges related to the institutions it acquires that could have a significant negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations;\n\u00b7 There may be substantial lag-time between completing an acquisition or opening a new office and generating sufficient assets and deposits to support costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7 The Company may not be able to finance an acquisition, or the financing it obtains may have an adverse effect on its results of operations or result in dilution to its existing shareholders;\n\u00b7 The Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention in negotiating a transaction and integrating the operations and personnel of the combining businesses may be diverted from its existing business and the Company may not be able to successfully integrate such operations and personnel;\n\u00b7 If the Company experiences problems with system conversions, financial losses could be sustained from transactions processed incorrectly or not at all;\n\u00b7 The Company may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition;\n\u00b7 The Company may enter new markets where it lacks local experience or that introduce new risks to its operations, or that otherwise result in adverse effects on its results of operations;\n\u00b7 The Company may introduce new products and services it is not equipped to manage or that introduce new risks to its operations, or that otherwise result in adverse effects on its results of operations;\n\u00b7 The Company may incur intangible assets in connection with an acquisition, or the intangible assets it incurs may become impaired, which results in adverse short-term effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations;\n\u00b7 The Company may assume liabilities in connection with an acquisition, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price; or\n\u00b7 The Company may lose key employees and customers.\nThe Company cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully integrate any banking offices that the Company acquires into its operations or retain the customers of those offices. If any of these risks occur in connection with the Company\u2019s expansion efforts, it may have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nNew bank office facilities and other facilities may not be profitable. The Company may not be able to organically expand into new markets that are profitable for its franchise. The costs to start up bank branches and loan production offices in new markets, other than through acquisitions, and the additional costs to operate these facilities would increase the Company\u2019s noninterest expense and may decrease its earnings. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage the Company\u2019s growth through the establishment of bank branches or loan production offices in new markets. In addition, the Company can provide no assurance that its expansion into any such new markets will successfully attract enough new business to offset the expenses of their operation. If the Company is not able to do so, its earnings and stock price may be negatively impacted.\nAcquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities may expose the Company to intangible asset risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. In connection with any acquisitions, as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the Company will record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, and, as such, acquisitions may result in the Company recording intangible assets, including deposit intangibles and goodwill. The Company will perform a goodwill valuation at least annually to test for goodwill impairment. Impairment testing is a two-step process that first compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and second measures impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Adverse conditions in its business climate, including a significant decline in future operating cash flows, a significant change in the Company\u2019s stock price or market capitalization, or a deviation from the Company\u2019s expected growth rate and performance may significantly affect the fair value of any goodwill and may trigger impairment losses, which could be materially adverse to the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s growth strategy depends on the Company\u2019s ability to identify and retain individuals with experience and relationships in the markets in which it intends to expand. The Company\u2019s growth strategy contemplates that it may expand its business and operations to other markets in the Carolinas and Virginia through organic growth and selective acquisitions. The Company intends to primarily target market areas that it believes possess attractive demographic, economic or competitive characteristics. To expand into new markets successfully, The Company must identify and retain experienced key management members with local expertise and relationships in these markets. Competition for qualified personnel in the markets in which the Company may expand may be intense, and there may be a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the commercial banking industry in these markets. Even if the Company identifies individuals that it believes could assist it in establishing a presence in a new market, the Company may be unable to recruit these individuals away from other banks or be unable to do so at a reasonable cost. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company\u2019s strategy is often lengthy. The Company\u2019s inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage new offices effectively would limit its growth and could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income and profitability. The Company is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that the Bank is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are bank or financial institution failures that exceed the FDIC\u2019s expectations, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums than those currently in force. Any future increases or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank. The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. Dividends received from the Bank are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on its outstanding debt securities. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. In the event the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company might not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. Such an inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1 \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation\u201d and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur allowance for credit losses may be insufficient. All borrowers carry the potential to default, and our remedies to recover (seizure and/or sale of collateral, legal actions, guarantees, etc.) may not fully satisfy money previously lent. We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance for credit losses reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; credit loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political, and regulatory conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan chargeoffs, based on judgments different than those of management. An increase in the allowance for credit losses results in a decrease in net income, and possibly risk-based capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the value of real estate in the markets we serve were to decline, a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on us. At December 31, 2014, our loans secured by real estate totaled $1.58 billion, or 87.4% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). A decline in local economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans. A decline in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. See Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses in the accompanying Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion related to the Bank\u2019s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible credit losses. Additionally, a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for credit losses through increased provisions for credit losses, which would negatively impact our profits. Also, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. Real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, among other things, changes in general or regional economic conditions, governmental rules or policies, and natural disasters.\nOur commercial real estate lending may expose us to risk of loss and hurt our earnings and profitability. We regularly make loans secured by commercial real estate. These types of loans generally have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities than traditional one to four family residential mortgage loans. Further, loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally for larger amounts and involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans. Payments on loans secured by these properties are often dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. Because of the recent general economic slowdown, these loans represent higher risk, could result in an increase in our total net chargeoffs and could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. At December 31, 2014, our loans secured by commercial real estate totaled $736.9 million, which represented 40.8% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). Of those loans, loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate totaled $310.0 million. While we seek to minimize risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nOur land acquisition, development and construction loans involve a higher degree of risk than other segments of our loan portfolio. A portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of land acquisition, development and construction loans. Construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than commercial real estate lending. Repayment of land acquisition, development and construction loans are dependent on the successful completion of the projects they finance. Risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. When lending to builders, the cost of construction breakdown is provided by the builder, as well as supported by the appraisal. Although our underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will safeguard against material delinquencies and losses to our operations. At December 31, 2014, we had loans of $168.1 million, or 9.3% of total loans outstanding (excluding loans held for sale), to finance land acquisition, development and construction, including $45.8 million of speculative residential construction and residential acquisition and development. At December 31, 2014, the Bank\u2019s concentration levels of land acquisition, development and construction (the \u201cAD&C portfolio\u201d) loans and total commercial real estate loans were 63.82% and 256.55%, respectively, of total regulatory capital. The interagency regulatory guidance maximum concentrations are 100% and 300%, respectively.\nThe Bank is subject to interest rate risk. The Bank\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Bank\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Bank receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Bank\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Bank\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of certain of the Bank\u2019s interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Bank\u2019s net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, there are costs associated with the Bank\u2019s risk management techniques, and these costs could be material. Fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable and, therefore, there can be no assurances of the Bank\u2019s ability to continue to maintain a consistent, positive spread between the interest earned on the Bank\u2019s earning assets and the interest paid on the Bank\u2019s interest-bearing liabilities. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s management of interest rate risk.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk. We use derivative financial instruments, primarily consisting of interest rate swaps contracts, to limit our exposure to interest rate risk. No hedging strategy can completely protect us; the derivative financial instruments we elect may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risks. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. We cannot be assured that our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in or magnify losses.\nWe may face increasing loan and investment yield pressures, which may, among other things reduce our profitability. The interest rate environment has been at a historically low level for an extended period of time. This has had a negative effect on our interest income and net interest margin as new loans and investments are made, or existing loans renewed and maturing investments replaced, at lower rates than those of the portfolios as a whole. If interest rates continue at these low levels, there likely will be further negative effect on interest income and the net interest margin.\nWe may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market or other non-depository investments, as providing superior expected returns or seek to spread their deposits over several banks to maximize FDIC insurance coverage. Furthermore, technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank clients to transfer funds into alternative investments, including products offered by other financial institutions or non-bank service providers. Increases in short-term interest rates could increase transfers of deposits to higher yielding deposits. Efforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits, including deposit pricing, can increase our costs. When bank clients move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher yielding deposits, or spread their accounts over several banks, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, thus increasing our funding costs.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition would likely suffer if there is a deterioration in the general economic condition of the areas in which the Bank does business. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Bank primarily provides services to clients located in four principal market areas in NC. Because the Bank\u2019s lending and deposit-gathering activities are concentrated in these markets, particularly the Piedmont Triad Region, the Bank will be affected by the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Adverse developments in local industries have had and could continue to have a negative effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Even though the Bank\u2019s clients\u2019 business and financial interest may extend well beyond these market areas, adverse economic conditions that affect these market areas could reduce the Bank\u2019s growth rate, affect the ability of the Bank\u2019s clients to repay their loans and generally affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. A decline in general economic conditions in the Bank\u2019s market areas, caused by inflation, recession, higher unemployment or other factors which are beyond the Bank\u2019s control would also impact these local economic conditions and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank competes with much larger companies for some of the same business. The banking and financial services business in our market areas continues to be a competitive field and it is becoming more competitive as a result of changes in regulations, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by the nature or pace of change in competition. We compete for loans, deposits and clients with various bank and nonbank financial services providers, many of which are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services.\nNegative publicity could damage our reputation. Reputation risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and expose us to adverse legal and regulatory consequences. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of client information, criminal security breaches and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct.\nThe Bank is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities. A significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Bank may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Bank may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Bank to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Bank\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations of enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Bank\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Bank has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those clients, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could cause us to enter into unfavorable transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity is essential to our business. Our ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our ability to obtain funding for loan originations, working capital, possible acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, securities sold under repurchase agreements, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. We do not anticipate that our retail and commercial deposits will be sufficient to meet our funding needs in the foreseeable future. We therefore rely on deposits obtained through intermediaries, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other wholesale funding sources to obtain the funds necessary to manage our balance sheet.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general, including a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets. To the extent we are not successful in obtaining such funding, we will be unable to implement our strategy as planned which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and condition. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nThe FASB is moving forward with its proposal to change the manner in which the allowance for credit losses is established and evaluated from the concept of incurred losses to that of expected losses. Management is in the process of evaluating this change in accounting standard on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. If the change results in a material increase in our allowance and future provisions for credit losses, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment of investment securities, goodwill, certain other intangible assets, or deferred tax assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations. In assessing the impairment of investment securities, management considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. Under current accounting standards, certain other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer amortized but, instead, are assessed for impairment periodically or when impairment indicators are present. Assessment of certain other intangible assets could result in circumstances where the applicable intangible asset is deemed to be impaired for accounting purposes. Under such circumstances, the intangible asset\u2019s impairment would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the period during which such impairment is identified. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the corporate income tax rate during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The value of our deferred tax assets reflects the current federal and state corporate income tax rates of approximately 35 percent and five percent, respectively. Failure to generate future taxable income in line with our current projections and/or a reduction in the corporate income tax rate could cause us to further impair our deferred tax assets, which impairment would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the period during which such impairment is identified. The impact of each of these impairment matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTechnological advances impact the Bank\u2019s business. The banking industry continues to undergo technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving client services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of the Bank\u2019s clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Bank may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to its clients.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. Third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, we cannot make assurances that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation; result in a loss of client business; result in expense to investigate, respond to, mitigate, and recover from the event; subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny; or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Company has not experienced any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of our communications and information systems. The company has incurred immaterial expense due to well publicized external card breaches.\nUnpredictable catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, pandemic disease, windstorms, floods, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and other catastrophes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on the Bank in that such events could materially disrupt its operations or the ability or willingness of its clients to access the financial services offered by the Bank. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Although the Bank carries insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain catastrophic events, these events could nevertheless reduce the Company\u2019s earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and/or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price can be volatile. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022 Recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 Operating results and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022 News reports relating to trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022 Perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022 New technology used or services offered by competitors;\n\u2022 Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors; and\n\u2022 Changes in government regulations.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors, and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s trading volume is low compared with larger national and regional banks. A class of the Company\u2019s common stock (Class A common stock) is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. However, the trading volume of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock is relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the NASDAQ, the NYSE or other consolidated reporting systems or stock exchanges. Thus, the market in the Company\u2019s Class A common stock may be limited in scope relative to larger companies. In addition, the Company cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for its Class A common stock will develop.\nThe Company has outstanding subordinated debt, which ranks senior to our common stock. In 2005, the Company issued $25.8 million in subordinated debentures in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities by its trust subsidiary. In 2014, the Company issued $15.5 million in subordinated notes. This subordinated debt ranks senior to our common stock. As a result, we must make dividend payments on the trust preferred securities and interest payments on the subordinated notes before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our liquidation, the holders of the trust preferred securities and the subordinated notes must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We may issue additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nWe may issue additional debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in the event of liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock. In the future, we may issue additional debt or equity securities, including securities convertible into equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, the holders of our debt and preferred securities must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate with certainty the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nOur common stock is not FDIC insured. The Company\u2019s common stock is not a savings or deposit account or other obligation of any bank and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency and is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, holders of our common stock may lose some or all of their investment.", "PERMNO": 89440, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "NBBC"}
