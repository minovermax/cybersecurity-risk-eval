{"cik": "1585364", "company": "PERRIGO Co plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nINDEX TO RISK FACTORS\nPAGE NO.\nOperational Risks\nGlobal Risks\nLitigation and Insurance Risks\nTax Related Risks\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nOperational Risks\nWe face vigorous competition from other pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies that may threaten the commercial acceptance and pricing of our products.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete against store brand, generic, and branded health and wellness products. Competition is also impacted by changes in regulations and government pricing programs that may give competitors an advantage. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be harmed through loss of customers or increased negative pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022\nAs a manufacturer of generic versions of brand-name drugs through our CSCA and RX segments, we experience competition from brand-name drug companies that may try to prevent, discourage or delay the use of generic versions through various measures, including introduction of new branded products, legislative initiatives, changing dosage forms or dosing regimens, regulatory processes, filing new patents or patent extensions, lawsuits, citizens\u2019 petitions, and negative publicity prior to introduction of a generic product. In addition, brand-name competitors may lower their prices to compete with generic products, increase advertising, or launch, either through an affiliate or licensing arrangements with another company, an authorized generic at or near the time the first generic product is launched, depriving the generic product of potential market exclusivity.\n\u2022\nOur CSCA and RX segments may experience increased price competition as other generic companies produce the same product, sometimes for dramatically lower margins in order to gain market share. Other companies may introduce new drugs and/or drug delivery techniques that make our current products less desirable. A drug may be subject to competition from alternative therapies during the period of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity, and thereafter, we may be subject to further competition from generic products and OTC pharmaceuticals or biosimilars.\n\u2022\nWe develop and distribute branded products through our CSCA and CSCI segments. We experience competition from other brand-name companies, many of which are larger and have more resources to devote to advertising and marketing. These direct competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements. Our current and future competitors may develop products comparable or superior to those offered by us at more competitive prices.\n\u2022\nOur CSCA and RX segments also experience competition from generic drug manufacturers, some of whom are significantly larger than we are, who may develop their products more rapidly or complete regulatory approval processes sooner, or may market their products earlier than we do.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nIf we do not continue to develop, manufacture, and market innovative products, introduce new line extensions, or expand into adjacent categories that meet customer demands, we may lose market share and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\nOur continued growth is due in large part to our ability to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer requirements for quality, safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness. Continuous introductions of new products and product categories are critical to our business. If we do not continue to develop, manufacture, and market new products, we could lose market share, and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nWe maintain a diversified product line to function as a primary supplier for our customers. Capital investments are driven by growth, technological advancements, cost improvement and the need for manufacturing flexibility. Our future capital expenditures could vary materially due to the uncertainty of these factors. In addition, if we fail to stay current with the latest manufacturing, information and packaging technology, we may be unable to competitively support the launch of new product introductions.\n\u2022\nOur product margins may decline over time due to our products' aging life cycles, changes in consumer choice, changes in competition for our existing products, or the introduction of next generation innovative products; therefore, new product introductions are necessary to maintain our current financial condition. If we are unable to continue to create new products, we may lose market share or experience pricing pressure, and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nWe must prove that the regulated generic drug products in our CSCA and RX segments are bioequivalent to their branded counterparts, which may require bioequivalence studies, and in the case of topical products, even more extensive clinical endpoint trials to demonstrate their efficacy. The development and commercialization process, particularly with respect to innovative products, is both time consuming and costly, and subject to a high degree of business risk. Products currently under development may require re-design to meet evolving FDA standards, may not perform as expected, may not pass required bioequivalence studies, or may be the subject of intellectual property challenges. Necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all. Any of these events may negatively impact our net sales.\n\u2022\nEven if we are successful in developing a product, our customers' failure to launch one of our products successfully, or delays in manufacturing developed products, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the FDA or similar regulatory agency could impose higher standards and additional requirements, such as requiring more supporting data and clinical data than previously required, in order to gain regulatory clearance to launch new formulations into the market, which could negatively impact our future net sales.\nOur CSCA and CSCI segments are impacted by changes in consumer preferences. If we are unable to adapt to these changes, we may lose market share and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\nConsumer preferences related to health and nutritional concerns may change, which could negatively impact demand for our CSCA and CSCI products or cause us to incur additional costs to change our products or product packaging.\n\u2022\nThe future growth and stability of U.S. store brand market share can be impacted, in part, by general economic conditions, which can influence consumers to switch to and from store brand products. Our CSCA segment sales could be negatively affected if economic conditions improve and consumers return to purchasing higher-priced brand-name products. Conversely, while store brand products present an alternative to higher-priced branded products, if economic conditions deteriorate, our CSCA segment sales could be negatively impacted if consumers forgo obtaining healthcare or reduce their healthcare spending.\n\u2022\nOur CSCI segment's success is dependent on the continued growth in demand for its healthy lifestyle products, which includes products for weight management and well-being and smoking cessation. If demand for products in this category decreases, our CSCI segment's results of operations would be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nOur CSCA customers may request changes in packaging to meet consumer demands, which could cause us to incur inventory obsolescence charges and redesign costs, which in turn would negatively impact our CSCA segment's results of operations.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nOur nutritional product category within our CSCA segment is subject to changing consumer preferences and health and nutrition-related concerns. Our business depends, in part, on consumer preferences and choices, including the number of mothers who choose to use infant formula products rather than breastfeed their babies. To the extent that private, public, and government sources may promote the benefits of breastfeeding over the use of infant formula, there could be a reduced demand for infant formula products. We could also be adversely impacted by an increase in the number of families that are provided with infant formula by the U.S. federal government through the Women, Infants and Children program, as we do not participate in this program.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries, and any inability to timely meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nWe are subject to the regulations of a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. agencies related to the manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distribution, advertising, and sale of our products as described in detail in Item 1. Business - Government Regulation and Pricing. Changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations in the countries in which we operate could impose restrictions or delays on our ability to manufacture, distribute, sell or market our products, may be difficult or expensive for us to comply with, and may adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Below are some of the ways in which government regulation could impact our business and/or financial results:\n\u2022\nWe must obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agencies in order to manufacture and sell our products in the regions in which we operate. Obtaining this approval can be time consuming and costly. There can be no assurance that, in the event we submit an application for a marketing authorization to any global regulatory agency, we will obtain the approval to market a product and/or that we will obtain it on a timely basis. Laws unique to the U.S. regulatory framework encourage generic competition by providing eligibility for first generic marketing exclusivity if certain conditions are met. If we are granted generic exclusivity, the exclusivity may be shared with other generic companies, including authorized generics; or it is possible that we may forfeit 180-day exclusivity if we do not obtain regulatory approval or begin marketing the product within the statutory requirements. Finally, if we are not the first to file our ANDA, the FDA may grant 180-day exclusivity to another company, thereby effectively delaying the launch of our product and/or possibly reducing our market share.\n\u2022\nGlobal regulatory agencies regularly inspect our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our third-party suppliers. The failure of one of our facilities, or a facility of one of our third-party suppliers, to comply with applicable laws and regulations may lead to a breach of representations made to our customers, or to regulatory or government action against us related to the products made in that facility. Such action could include suspension of or delay in regulatory approvals. If the compliance violations are severe, agencies of the government may initiate product seizure, injunction, recall, suspension of production or distribution of our products, loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties, or civil or criminal prosecution, thereby impacting the reputation of all of our products.\n\u2022\nIn the U.S., the DSCSA requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which is being implemented incrementally over a 10-year period beginning on January 1, 2015, for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and re-packagers, and on July 1, 2015 for dispensers. Compliance with the U.S. electronic pedigree requirements has and will continue to increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.\n\u2022\nThe European Commission passed legislation requiring new product packaging \u2018safety features\u2019 to prevent falsification of medicinal products primarily within the prescription medicines sector. All marketing authorization holders in the EU member states and EEA members Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland were required to introduce the necessary changes by February 9, 2019 (or risk forfeiting their product licenses). However, manufacturers based out of Greece, Belgium and Italy have an extended timeline until February 9, 2025 to implement the serialization guidelines as they already feature similar requirements on their current drug packages. Compliance with the EU electronic pedigree requirements has and will continue to increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.\n\u2022\nGlobal regulatory agencies highly scrutinize any product application submitted to switch a product from physician prescribed Rx to unsupervised OTC use by the general public. The expansion of Rx-to-OTC\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nswitches is critical to our future growth. Reluctance of regulatory agencies to approve Rx-to-OTC switches in new product categories could impact that growth. Further, regulatory agencies can reassess the terms of OTC classification if they perceive a shift in the previously assessed benefit/risk profile. Any such reassessment may lead to OTC products reverting to prescription.\n\u2022\nOur infant formula products may be subject to barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade and dictating the specific content of infant formula products. Governments could enhance regulations on the industry aimed at ensuring the safety and quality of dairy products, including but not limited to, compulsory batch-by-batch inspection and testing for additional safety and quality issues. Such inspections and testing may increase our operating costs related to infant formula products.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain the necessary quota for controlled substances and List I chemicals, we risk having delayed product launches or failing to meet commercial supply obligations. If we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements for controlled substances and List I chemicals, the DEA, or similar regulatory agency, may take regulatory actions, resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of distribution of our products, withdrawal of our products from the market, or other penalties.\n\u2022\nIn order to commercially distribute our medical device products in the EU, they need to conform with the requirements of applicable EU directives. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an organization accredited by a member state, which includes an audit of the manufacturer\u2019s quality system and, for some products, specific product testing. If our products fail to meet the applicable EU directives, then we may not meet our projected growth targets and/or incur fines and penalties.\n\u2022\nComplying with the legislative framework for cosmetics and food supplements in the EU remains challenging as a result of changing EU regulations, diverging national regulations from EU regulations, and diverging regulations between EU member states. If our products fail to meet the applicable EU and/or national regulations, then we may not meet our projected growth targets and/or incur fines and penalties.\n\u2022\nBeginning on May 26, 2024, all medical devices sold in the EU will need to be approved under the MDR. Only notified bodies that have been designated under the MDR can carry out conformity assessment procedures, and only for certain types of devices listed by the product codes in their designation. This designation process is a lengthy and costly process, resulting in a shortage of certified notified bodies. If we fail to secure a notified body certified under MDR, this will impact our ability to keep our medical devices in the EU market. Without required approval for our medical devices under MDR, we are not permitted to sell such medical devices in the EU.\n\u2022\nOur operations extend to numerous countries outside the U.S. and are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations, and customs of various jurisdictions. These risks include compliance with a variety of national and local laws of countries in which we do business, such as restrictions on the import and export of certain intermediates, drugs, technologies and marking of the country of origin on products imported to the U.S. We must also comply with a variety of U.S. laws related to doing business outside of the U.S., including but not limited to, Office of Foreign Asset Controls; United Nations and EU sanctions; the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012; rules relating to the use of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and regulations enforced by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Further changes in laws, regulations, and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare system, including imports, exports, manufacturing, quality, cost, pricing, reimbursement, approval, inspection, and delivery of healthcare, may affect our business and operations.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nContinuing healthcare reforms and related changes to reimbursement methods in and outside of the United States may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing healthcare expenditures have received considerable public attention in many of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private insurers, have been focused on cost containment. In some markets in the EU and outside the U.S., the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Both private and governmental entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs. For example, the proposed Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would create a new office within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tasked with manufacturing certain generic drugs to be offered directly to consumers. It is unclear if this proposed legislation will be enacted, but these or similar legislative or regulatory efforts could place further pricing pressure on our products and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur RX segment in particular could be materially adversely impacted by measures taken by governmental entities or private insurers to restrict patients' access to our products or increase pressure on drug pricing, including denial of price increases, prospective and retrospective price decreases, and increased mandatory discounts or rebates. These actions may drive us and our competitors to decrease prices or may reduce the ability of customers to pay for our products, which could materially negatively impact the RX segment's results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in Item 1. Business - Medicaid Rebate Agreement, we have entered into various government drug pricing agreements with the U.S. government. There are inherent risks associated with participating in these programs, including the following:\n\u2022\nBy their nature, these programs require us to provide discounts and rebates and therefore reduce our net product revenue. Further, because the amounts of these discounts are based on our commercial sales practices and can be adversely affected by both significant discounts and price increases, it is important that we maintain pricing practices that appropriately take into account these government pricing programs.\n\u2022\nWe are required to report pricing data to CMS, including AMP, on a monthly and quarterly basis and BP and ASP on a quarterly basis. We also are required to report quarterly and annual Non-FAMPs to the VA. If we fail to submit required information on a timely basis, make misrepresentations, or knowingly submit false information to the government as to AMP, ASP, or BP, we may be liable for substantial civil monetary penalties or subject to other enforcement actions, such as under the False Claims Act, and CMS may terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement. In that event, U.S. federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\n\u2022\nBecause many of our products may be subject to Medicaid FULs or CMS\u2019s Medicaid \u201cactual acquisition cost\u201d payment methodology standard, our products may be subject to reimbursement pressures, and in some cases, those pressures may result from practices outside of our control, including how our competitors price their equivalent products. States are continuing to evaluate their payment methods, and we cannot predict how the FUL or state payment methodologies will affect our pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers may seek additional discounts in light of reimbursement changes in the future. We also cannot predict how the sharing of FUL data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace in the future.\n\u2022\nUnder the 340B program, if we fail to provide required discounts to covered entities, including in connection with the revision of AMP or BP data, we may be subject to refund claims or civil monetary penalties under that program pursuant to new program regulations that became effective January 1, 2019.\n\u2022\nIf we inadvertently overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or TriCare Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we would be required to refund the difference. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in False Claims Act allegations or potential violations of other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responses to a government investigation or enforcement action, are expensive and time-consuming, and\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\u2022\nOur reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Our calculations and methodologies are subject to review by the governmental agencies, and it is possible that these reviews could result in challenges to our submissions. If we do not comply with those reporting and payment obligations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties, and possible exclusion from U.S. federal healthcare programs.\nLack of availability, or significant increases in the cost, of raw materials used in manufacturing our products could adversely impact our profit margins and operating results.\nAffordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units due to the nature of the products we manufacture. In addition, maintaining good supply relationships is essential to our ongoing operations. See Item 1. Business - Materials Sourcing for more information.\n\u2022\nWe maintain several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory, performance, quality, support, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher-volume or more profitable products. Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of net sales. Additionally, global regulatory requirements for obtaining product approvals could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate material source. As a result, the loss of a single-source supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe rapid increase in cost of many raw materials from inflationary forces, such as increased energy costs, and our ability or inability to pass on these increases to our customers could have a negative material impact on our financial results.\n\u2022\nOur infant formula products require certain key raw ingredients that are derived from raw milk, such as skim milk powder, whey protein powder, and lactose. Our supply of milk-based ingredients may be limited by the ability of individual dairy farmers and cooperatives to provide raw milk in the amount and quality we deem necessary. Raw milk production is influenced by factors beyond our control including seasonal and environmental factors, governmental agricultural and environmental policy, and global demand. We cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies of these key ingredients necessary to produce infant formula.\n\u2022\nOur products, and the raw materials used to make the products mentioned above, generally have limited shelf lives. Our inventory levels are based, in part, on expectations regarding future sales. We may experience build-ups in inventory if sales slow. Any significant shortfall in sales may result in higher inventory levels of raw materials and finished products, thereby increasing the risk of inventory spoilage and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. Cargo thefts and/or diversions and economically or maliciously motivated product tampering on store shelves may occur, causing unexpected shortages and harm to our reputation, which may have a material impact on our operations.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third parties to source many of our raw materials, as well as to manufacture certain dosage forms such as sterile, injectable products that we distribute. We maintain a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify potential counterfeit ingredients, adulterants, and toxic substances. Nevertheless, discovery of previously unknown problems with the raw materials or product manufacturing processes, or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith, could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of the contaminated product from the marketplace, either temporarily or permanently. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs and lost revenue, harm our reputation, and may give rise to product liability litigation.\n\u2022\nChanges in regulation could impact the supply of the API and certain other raw materials used in our products. For example, the EU recently promulgated new standards requiring all API imported into the EU be certified as complying with GMP established by the EU. The regulations placed the certification\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nrequirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries, which led to an API supply shortage in Europe as certain governments were not willing or able to comply with the regulation in a timely fashion, or at all. In addition, due to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, we could experience supply disruptions related to materials sourced directly and indirectly from China or elsewhere. A shortage in API or other raw ingredients could cause us to have to cease manufacture of certain products, or to incur costs and delays to qualify other suppliers to substitute for those API manufacturers who are unable to export. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow.\nA disruption at any of our main manufacturing facilities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing operations are concentrated in a few locations. See Item 1. Business - Manufacturing and Distribution for more information on our significant operations. A significant disruption at one or more of these facilities, whether it be due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, intentional acts of vandalism, climate change, war, terrorism, insufficient quality, or pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, regulatory authorities routinely inspect all of our manufacturing facilities for cGMP compliance. While our manufacturing sites are cGMP compliant, if a regulatory authority were to identify serious adverse findings not corrected upon follow up inspections, we may be required to issue product recalls, shutdown manufacturing facilities, and take other remedial actions. If any manufacturing facility were forced to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected.\nAny breach, disruption or misuse of our or our external business partners\u2019 information systems or cyber security efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems to operate our business. Our systems, information and operations are highly complex and interrelated with our external business partners. These systems may contain confidential information (including personal data, trade secrets or other intellectual property, or proprietary business information). The nature of digital systems, both internally and externally, makes them potentially vulnerable to disruption or damage from human error and/or security breaches, which include, but are not limited to, ransomware, data theft, denial of service attacks, sabotage, industrial espionage, and computer viruses. Such events may be difficult to detect, and once detected, their impact may be difficult to assess and address.\nCyber attacks have become increasingly common for us and our external business partners, and we have experienced immaterial business disruption and data loss as a result of phishing, business email compromise and other types of attacks on our information technology systems and those of our external business partners. While we continue to employ resources to monitor our systems and protect our infrastructure, these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed, and that could subject us to significant risks, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nRansomware attacks, other cyber breaches or disruptions that impair our ability to develop products, meet regulatory approval requirements or deadlines, produce or ship products, take or fulfill orders, and/or collect or make payments on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nSystem issues, whether as a result of an intentional breach or a natural disaster, that damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, experience lower sales volume, and/or incur significant liabilities;\n\u2022\nSignificant expense to remediate the results of any attacks or breaches and to ensure compliance with any required disclosures mandated by the numerous global privacy and security laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nInterruptions, security breaches, or loss, misappropriation, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of confidential information,\nwhich, individually or collectively, could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures and viruses. If we are unable to execute our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, or if our plans prove insufficient for a\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nparticular situation or take longer than expected to implement in a crisis situation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur.\nWe are also subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect personal data, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and national laws implementing the GDPR. These data protection laws introduced more stringent data protection requirements and significant potential fines, as well as increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process. We have put mechanisms in place to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws but there can be no guarantee of their effectiveness.\nOur business depends upon certain customers for a significant portion of our sales, therefore our business would be adversely affected by a disruption of our relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in these customers' businesses.\nSales to our largest customer, Walmart, comprised approximately 13.0% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. While no other customer individually comprised more than 10% of net sales, we do have other significant customers. If our relationship with Walmart or any of our other significant customers, including the terms of doing business with the customers, changes significantly, it could have a material adverse impact on us (refer to Item 1. Business - Significant Customers).\nMany of our customers, which include major global, national, and regional retail drug, supermarket, and mass merchandise chains, major wholesalers, sourcing groups, hospitals, pharmacies, and drug and grocery stores located primarily in Europe, continue to merge or consolidate. Such consolidation has provided, and may continue to provide, customers with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures we face. The emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products. In addition, several of our customers have instituted sourcing programs limiting the number of suppliers of generic pharmaceutical products carried by that customer. These developments have resulted in heightened pricing pressure on our products, as well as competition among generic drug producers for business from a smaller and more selective customer base.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time, customers may choose to assess penalties, obtain alternate sources for products, and/or end their relationships with us.\nAlthough we have divested our rights to the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream, we are entitled to an additional milestone payment if a certain specified threshold is met, and any negative developments related to Tysabri\u00ae could have a material adverse effect on our potential receipt of this payment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we divested the Tysabri\u00ae financial asset to Royalty Pharma for $2.2 billion in upfront cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments. We received the $250.0 million royalty payment on February 22, 2019. In order for us to receive the milestone payment related to 2020 of $400.0 million, the payments received by Royalty Pharma from Biogen for Tysabri\u00ae sales in 2020 must exceed $351.0 million. The 2018 Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri\u00ae were $337.5 million.\nWe elected to account for the contingent milestone payments using the fair value option method, and these were recorded at an estimated fair value of $134.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Upon Tysabri\u00ae meeting the 2018 global net sales threshold we recorded a $170.1 million gain in Change in financial assets. The fair value of the milestone payment related to 2020 is $95.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Our receipt of the milestone payment related to 2020 may be negatively impacted if the royalty stream decreases and is insufficient to meet the specified thresholds. Given the fact that the milestone payment related to 2020 is recorded at fair value, if it is determined that Tysabri\u00ae global sales levels do not meet specific thresholds, we would recognize a material charge in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Factors that may have an adverse effect on the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream include:\n\u2022\nCompanies working to develop new therapies or alternative formulations of products for multiple sclerosis that, if successfully developed, would compete with, or could gain greater acceptance than, Tysabri\u00ae and damage its market share. For example, in February 2016, a competitor's pipeline product, Ocrevus\u00ae, received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA, and this product was launched in 2017. The\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nproduct competes with Tysabri\u00ae and could have a significant negative impact on the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream;\n\u2022\nBiogen is the owner of the patents on Tysabri\u00ae. The loss of protection of these patents, such as a patent invalidation, could adversely affect the royalty stream from Tysabri\u00ae. In addition, once the Tysabri\u00ae patents expire, other generic companies may introduce products similar to Tysabri\u00ae that could adversely affect the royalty stream;\n\u2022\nForeign currency movement, which could have a negative impact on Royalty Pharma's Tysabri\u00ae sales, thereby reducing the royalties;\n\u2022\nAny negative developments relating to Tysabri\u00ae, such as safety, efficacy, or reimbursement issues, could reduce demand for Tysabri\u00ae; and\n\u2022\nAdverse regulatory or legislative developments could limit or prohibit the sale of Tysabri\u00ae, such as restrictions on the use of Tysabri\u00ae or safety-related label changes, including enhanced risk management programs, which may significantly reduce expected royalty revenue and require significant expense and management time to address the associated legal and regulatory issues.\nAdditionally, Tysabri\u00ae sales growth cannot be assured given the significant restrictions on its use and the significant safety warnings on the label, including the risk of developing Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (\"PML\"), a serious brain infection. The risk of developing PML may increase with prior immunosuppressant use, longer treatment duration, or the presence of certain antibodies. Increased incidence of PML could limit sales growth, prompt regulatory review, require significant changes to the label, or result in market withdrawal. In addition, the result of ongoing or future clinical trials involving Tysabri\u00ae or other adverse events reported in association with the use of Tysabri\u00ae may have an adverse impact on prescribing behavior and reduce sales of Tysabri\u00ae.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that Royalty Pharma will pay the 2020 milestone payment even if the specified thresholds are met.\nWe are dependent on the services of certain key members of management. Our inability to successfully manage transition, or the failure to attract and retain other key members of management, may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the services of certain key employees, and our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Key functions for us include executive managers, operational managers, R&D scientists, information technology specialists, financial and legal specialists, regulatory professionals, quality compliance specialists, and sales/marketing personnel. If we are unable to attract or retain key qualified employees, our future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nManagement transition creates uncertainties, and any difficulties we experience in managing such transitions may negatively impact our business.\nOn February 7, 2020, we announced the retirement of Jeff Needham and appointed Rich Sorota as the Executive Vice President and President of CSCA effective March 23, 2020. Changes in executive management create uncertainty. Moreover, changes in our company as a result of management transition could have a disruptive impact on our ability to implement, or result in changes to, our strategy and could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are dependent upon consumers' perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products, and may be affected by changing consumer preferences. Negative consumer perception may arise from media reports, product liability claims, regulatory investigations, or recalls, regardless of whether they involve us or our products. The mere publication of information asserting defects in products or ingredients, or concerns about our products or the materials used in our products, could discourage consumers from buying our products, regardless of whether such information is scientifically supported.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nOur products involve risks such as product contamination, spoilage, mislabeling, and tampering that could require us to recall one or more of our products. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, product seizures, loss of certain licenses, delays in the issuance of governmental approvals for new products, or other governmental penalties, all of which could be detrimental to our reputation and reduce demand for our products.\n\u2022\nWe cannot guarantee that counterfeiting, imitation or other tampering with our products will not occur or that we will be able to detect and resolve it. Any counterfeiting or contamination of any products could negatively impact our reputation and sales, particularly if counterfeit or imitation products cause death or injury to consumers.\n\u2022\nMany of the brands we acquired from Omega Pharma Invest N.V (\"Omega\") have European recognition. This recognition is the result of the large investments Omega made (and we continue to make) in its products over many years. The quality and safety of the products are critical to our business. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, efficacy, or similar matters, sentiments toward us and our products could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nOur CSCI segment's financial success is dependent on the success of its brands, and the success of these brands can suffer if marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers, and the performance of the segment may be negatively impacted if spending on such plans and initiatives does not generate the returns we anticipate. In addition, given the association of individual products within the commercial network of our CSCI segment, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of other products, thereby potentially hurting our financial results.\n\u2022\nPowdered infant formula products are not sterile. All of our infant formula products must be prepared and maintained according to label instruction to retain their flavor and nutritional value and avoid contamination or deterioration. Depending on the product, a risk of contamination or deterioration may exist at each stage of the production cycle, including the purchase and delivery of raw materials, the processing and packaging of food products, and the use and handling by consumers, hospital personnel, and healthcare professionals. If certain of our infant formula products are found or alleged to have suffered contamination or deterioration, whether or not under our control, our reputation and our infant formula product category sales could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputation damage.\nThe Company and our employees increasingly utilize social media as a means of internal and external communication.\n\u2022\nTo the extent that we seek to use social media tools to communicate about our products and/or business, there are uncertainties as to the rules that apply to such communications, or as to the interpretations that authorities will apply to the rules that exist. As a result, despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is risk that our use of social media for such purposes may cause us to be found in violation of them. A violation of such guidelines may damage our reputation as well as cause potential lawsuits and adversely affect our operating activities.\n\u2022\nOur employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media tools in ways that may not be aligned with our social media strategy, may give rise to liability, or could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others.\n\u2022\nNegative posts or comments about us, store brands or generic pharmaceuticals, or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation and could adversely affect our business. In addition, negative posts or comments about our products could result in increased pharmacovigilance reporting requirements, which may give rise to liability if we fail to fully comply with such requirements.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nOur quarterly results are impacted by several factors, some of which are beyond the control of our management, that may result in significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in operating results.\nSome of the factors that may impact our quarterly results include, but are not limited to, the severity, length and timing of the cough/cold/flu and allergy seasons, the timing of new product approvals and introductions by us and our competitors, price competition, changes in the regulatory environment, changes in accounting pronouncements, changes in the levels of inventories maintained by our customers, and the timing of retailer promotional programs. These and other factors may result in significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter.\nWe may not be able to sustain or improve operating results in our business segments.\nSeveral factors may impact our ability to sustain or improve the operating results of our business segments. These factors include but are not limited to, the continued impact of pricing pressure, the success of new product launches, the impact of manufacturing disruptions or delays, and the success of strategic improvement initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience challenges related to our segments, and these challenges could have a material impact on our business, cash flows, and results of operations or result in impairment charges, and the market value of our ordinary shares and/or debt securities may decline.\nWe may not realize the benefits of business acquisitions and divestitures we enter into, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions and divestitures. These transactions are accompanied by several risks. Many of these risks are beyond our control, and any one of them could result in increased cost, decreased net sales and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, any or all of which could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAcquisitions\nOne of our strategies is inorganic growth through the acquisition of products and companies that we expect will benefit the Company. This strategy comes with several financial, managerial, and operational risks. We may not realize the benefits of an acquisition because of integration and other challenges, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nDifficulty involved with managing the expanded operations of the respective parties, as well as identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, and contingent and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nUncertainties involved in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability of the respective parties, as well as identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, and contingent and other liabilities of acquisition targets;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated changes in the business, industry, market or general economic conditions different from the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the transaction;\n\u2022\nDifficulties due to a lack of, or limited experience in, any new product or geographic markets we enter;\n\u2022\nInability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies, or return on investment, from an acquisition in the amounts or on the time frame anticipated;\n\u2022\nSubstantial demands on our management, operational resources, technology, and financial and internal control systems, which could lead to dissatisfaction and potential loss of key customers, management, or employees;\n\u2022\nIntegration activities that may detract attention from our day-to-day business, and substantial costs associated with the transaction process or other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts; and\n\u2022\nDifficulties, restrictions or increased costs associated with raising future capital in connection with an acquisition may impact our liquidity, credit ratings and financial position, thereby making it more difficult, restrictive or expensive to raise future capital. In addition, the issuance of equity to pay a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition would dilute our existing shareholders.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nDivestitures\nWe may evaluate potential divestiture opportunities with respect to portions of our business (including specific assets or categories of assets) from time to time, and may proceed with a divestiture opportunity if and when we believe it is consistent with our business strategy and initiatives. Any future divestitures could expose us to significant risk, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nOur ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and personnel to any purchaser;\n\u2022\nFees for legal and transaction-related services;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management resources; and\n\u2022\nLoss of key personnel and reduction in revenue.\nIf we do not realize the expected strategic, economic or other benefits of any divestiture transaction, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe plan to separate our RX business is contingent upon several conditions, is subject to change in form or timing, may not achieve the intended benefits, and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn August 9, 2018, we announced a plan to separate our RX business, which, when completed, will enable us to focus on expanding our consumer-focused businesses. In 2019, we continued preparations related to our planned separation, which may include a possible sale, spin-off, merger or other form of separation. While we remain committed to transforming to a consumer-focused business, we have not committed to a specific date or form for the separation.\nThe separation of the RX business could impact our ability to retain key employees, comply with existing debt arrangements, maintain our credit ratings and raise future capital. Further, even if the separation is completed, we may not achieve the anticipated operational, financial, strategic or other benefits of the separation. After the separation, the combined value and financial performance of the Company and RX business may not equal the value and financial performance of the Company had the separation not occurred.\nIn connection with the proposed separation, we have incurred significant preparation costs and will continue to incur costs that, when completed, will be in the range of $45.0 million to $80.0 million, excluding restructuring expenses and transaction costs, depending on the final timing and structure of the transaction. In addition, completion of the separation will require a significant amount of management time and effort, which may disrupt our business or otherwise divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business, including our other strategic initiatives, possible organic or inorganic growth opportunities, and customer and vendor relationships. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected by the performance of our collaboration partners and suppliers.\nWe have entered into strategic alliances with partners and suppliers to develop, manufacture, market and/or distribute certain products, or components of our products in various markets. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to these various collaborations. There is a risk that our investments in these collaborative arrangements will not generate financial returns. While we believe our relationships with our partners and suppliers generally are successful, disputes, conflicting priorities or regulatory or legal intervention could be a source of delay or uncertainty as to the expected benefit of the collaboration (refer to Item 8. Note 18). A failure or inability of our partners or suppliers to fulfill their collaboration obligations, or the occurrence of any of the risks above, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have acquired significant assets that could become impaired or subject us to losses and may result in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of previous acquisitions, which could become impaired and lead to material charges in the future.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $109.2 million in our RX segment, definite-lived impairment charges of $69.5 million in our RX and CSCI segments, and $5.8 million of impairment charges related to certain in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") assets in our CSCA, CSCI, and RX segments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded goodwill, definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $136.7 million, $49.6 million and $27.7 million primarily in our CSCA segment, respectively, and $8.7 million of impairment charge related to certain IPR&D assets in our CSCA segment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $19.7 million related to developed product technology/formulation and product rights, and distribution and license agreements primarily in our RX segment and $12.7 million of impairment charge related to certain IPR&D assets primarily in our RX segment.\nWe perform an impairment analysis on intangible assets subject to amortization when there is an indication that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable. Any significant change in market conditions, estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicates a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known. Goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible asset, and definite-lived intangible asset impairments are recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2019, the net book value of our goodwill and intangible assets were $4.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively (refer to Item 8. Note 4).\nThere can be no assurance that our strategic initiatives will achieve their intended effects.\nWe are in the process of implementing certain initiatives designed to increase operational efficiency and improve our return on invested capital by globalizing our supply chain through global shared service arrangements, streamlining our organizational structure, making key executive employee changes, performing a strategic portfolio review, and disposing of certain assets. Furthermore, we are transitioning into a consumer-focused, self-care company. We believe these initiatives will enhance our net sales, operating margins, and earnings; however, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will produce the anticipated benefits. Any delay or failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our projected results.\nWhile we have remediated previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to our income tax process, we may identify other material weaknesses in the future.\nWe are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls on a periodic basis and publicly disclose the results of these evaluations and related matters in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that related to the matters associated with our income tax process, which have been remediated.\nWhile we have remediated those previously identified material weaknesses, there can be no assurances that our controls will remain adequate. Any failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, including retention of key employees, could result in additional material weaknesses or material misstatements in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Any new misstatement could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price. We cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nGlobal Risks\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations.\nWe manufacture, source raw materials, and sell our products in a number of countries. The percentage of our business outside the U.S. has been increasing. We are subject to risks associated with international manufacturing and sales, including:\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nProblems related to markets with different cultural biases or political systems;\n\u2022\nPossible difficulties in enforcing agreements;\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles and shipping lead-times;\n\u2022\nDifficulties obtaining export or import licenses;\n\u2022\nChanges to U.S. and foreign trade policies, including the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., including but not limited to, goods imported from China; and\n\u2022\nImposition of withholding or other taxes.\nAdditionally, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits by governmental authorities responsible for administering import and export regulations. To the extent that we are unable to successfully defend against an audit or review, we may be required to pay assessments, penalties, and increased duties.\nCertain of our facilities operate in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board, which allows us certain tax advantages on products and raw materials shipped through these facilities. If the Foreign Trade Zone Board were to revoke the sub-zone designation or limit our use, we could be subject to increased duties.\nAlthough we believe that we conduct our business in compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery and economic sanctions laws, if we are found to not be in compliance with such laws or other anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to governmental investigations, legal or regulatory proceedings, substantial fines, and/or other legal or equitable penalties. This risk increases in locations outside of the U.S., particularly in locations that have not previously had to comply with the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act 2010, Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offenses) Act 2018, and similar laws.\nWe operate in jurisdictions that could be affected by economic and political instability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations and supply partners could be affected by economic or political instability, embargoes, military hostilities, unstable governments and legal systems, and inter-governmental disputes. We have significant operations in Israel, which has experienced varying degrees of hostility in recent years. Doing business in Israel and certain other regions involves the following risks:\n\u2022\nCertain countries and international organizations have refused to do business with companies with Israeli operations. We are also precluded from marketing our products to certain countries due to U.S. and Israeli regulatory restrictions. International economic sanctions and boycotts of our products could negatively impact our sales and ability to export our products.\n\u2022\nOur facilities in Israel are within a conflict zone. If terrorist acts or military actions were to result in substantial damage to our facilities, our business activities would be disrupted since, with respect to most products, we would need to obtain prior regulatory agency approval for a change in manufacturing site.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nThe U.S. Department of State and other governments have at times issued advisories regarding travel to certain countries in which we do business. As a result, regulatory agencies have, at various times, curtailed or prohibited their inspectors from traveling to inspect facilities. If these inspectors are unable to inspect our facilities, the regulatory agencies could withhold approval for new products intended to be produced at those facilities.\n\u2022\nOur international operations may be subject to interruption due to travel restrictions, war, terrorist acts, and other armed conflicts. Also, further threats of armed hostilities in certain countries could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the cancellation of contracts or the loss of assets. These events could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations.\n\u2022\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK electorate voted in a referendum to voluntarily depart from the EU, known as \"Brexit\". Following the formation of a majority Conservative government in December 2019, the UK approved the withdrawal agreement and left the EU on January 31, 2020. The terms of the UK's final withdrawal remain subject to ongoing negotiation until December 31, 2020, during which current EU regulations will continue to apply in the UK. The UK Parliament banned extensions to the transition period, so the UK must finalize new trading agreements with the EU by December 31, 2020. Trade negotiations are expected to begin in early March 2020, but the nature of the economic relationship between the EU and UK remains uncertain, and there is no guarantee that both parties will be able to reach an agreement before the transition period expires. Additionally, the UK will likely negotiate trade deals with other partners, including the United States. Brexit has created significant instability and volatility in the global financial markets, has led to significant weakening of the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions. Although it is unknown what the future trading terms with the EU will be, they may impair the ability of our operations in the EU to transact business in the future in the UK, and similarly the ability of our UK operations to transact business in the future in the EU. Specifically, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports, including possible tariffs, between the UK and EU countries, increased restrictions on freedom of movement for employees, and increased regulatory complexities. Future trading terms between the UK and other trading partners are also unknown. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. We are actively monitoring Brexit updates from a government and regulatory perspective. We are preparing for a \u201chard (no confirmed trading deal with the EU) Brexit\", which is intended to ensure we meet both applicable EU and UK regulatory requirements as well as stock-builds to secure supply continuity. There can be no assurances, however, that these preparations will be sufficient or that the final exit terms will be as we anticipate. Any of the above mentioned effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, operations, and financial results.\n\u2022\nWhile the challenging global economic environment has not had a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources, there can be no assurance that possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources, impact our ability to obtain financing, or decrease the value of our assets.\n\u2022\nThe challenging economic conditions have also impacted the movements in exchange rates, which have experienced significant recent volatility. Uncertainty regarding the future growth rates between countries, the influence of central bank actions, and the changing political environment globally may contribute to continued high levels of exchange rate volatility, which could have an adverse impact on our results.\n\u2022\nOur customers could be adversely impacted if U.S. economic conditions worsen. Our CSCA segment does not advertise our store brand products like national brand companies and thus is largely dependent on retailer promotional activities to drive sales volume and increase market share. If our customers do not have the ability to invest in store brand promotional activities, our sales may suffer. Additionally, while we actively review the credit worthiness of our customers and suppliers, we cannot fully predict to what extent they may be negatively impacted by slowing economic growth.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nThe international scope of our business exposes us to risks associated with foreign exchange rates.\nWe report our financial results in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our net sales, assets, indebtedness and other liabilities, and costs are denominated in foreign currencies. These currencies include, among others, the Euro, Indian rupee, British pound, Canadian dollar, Israeli shekel, Australian dollar, and Mexican peso. Our Branded Consumer Self-care business is a euro-denominated business that represents a significant portion of our net sales, net earnings and net assets.\nIn addition, several emerging market economies are particularly vulnerable to the impact of rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, weaker oil and other commodity prices, and large external deficits. Risks in one country can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in another country or countries. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our operations. Our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by movements in exchange rates. In addition, we may also be exposed to credit risks in some of those markets. We may implement currency hedges or take other actions intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not successful in mitigating the effects of changes in exchange rates on our business, any such changes could materially impact our results.\nLitigation and Insurance Risks\nWe are or may become involved in lawsuits and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits arising from a wide variety of commercial, manufacturing, development, marketing, sales and other business-related matters, including, but not limited to, competitive issues, pricing, contract issues, intellectual property matters, false advertising, unfair competition, taxation matters, workers' compensation, product quality/recall, environmental remediation, securities law, disclosure, and regulatory issues. Litigation is unpredictable and can be costly. We intend to vigorously defend against any lawsuits, however, we cannot predict how the cases will be resolved. Adverse results in the cases could result in substantial monetary judgments. No assurance can be made that litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in the future (refer to Item 8. Note 17).\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to liability if our products violate applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdictions where our products are distributed. The successful assertion of product liability or other product-related claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages, and we could incur substantial legal expenses. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful, not merited, or not fully pursued, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim, and our reputation may suffer.\n\u2022\nWe may face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may in the future face liability for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under or in our currently or formerly owned property, or from a third-party disposal facility that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The actual or alleged presence of these substances, or the failure to remediate them, could have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on our ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. There can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on us. See Item 1. Business - Information Applicable to All Reportable Segments - Environmental for more information.\n\u2022\nOur CSCI and CSCA segments regularly make advertising claims regarding the effectiveness of their products, which we are responsible for defending. An unsuccessful defense of a product-related claim could result in potentially significant monetary damages and substantial legal expenses. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, not merited, or not fully pursued, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim, and our reputation could suffer.\n\u2022\nAdditionally, we are the target of claims asserting violations of securities fraud and derivative actions, or other litigation proceedings, and may be in the future.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nIncreased scrutiny on pricing practices and competition in the pharmaceutical industry, including antitrust enforcement activity by government agencies and class action litigation, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThere has been increased scrutiny regarding sales, marketing, and pricing practices in the pharmaceutical industry, including criminal antitrust investigations regarding drug pricing, multiple civil antitrust litigations initiated by governmental and private plaintiffs against pharmaceutical manufacturers and individuals, and media reports.\nOn May 2, 2017, we disclosed that search warrants were executed at several Perrigo facilities and other locations in connection with the Antitrust Division\u2019s ongoing investigation related to drug pricing in the pharmaceutical industry. Although no charges have been brought to date against Perrigo or any of our current employees (or, to the best of our knowledge, former employees), we take the investigation very seriously.\nIf criminal antitrust charges are filed involving Perrigo, we would incur substantial litigation and other costs, and could face substantial monetary penalties, injunctive relief, negative publicity and damage to our reputation. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, responding to those charges would divert management\u2019s time and attention and could impair our operations. Further, we cannot predict whether legislative or regulatory changes may result from the ongoing public scrutiny of our industry, what the nature of any such changes might be, or what impact they may have on Perrigo. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and reputation. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, any adverse decision could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe are cooperating with the government\u2019s investigation and are committed to operating our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and the highest standards of ethical conduct. We do not condone, and will not countenance, any violation of these standards by our employees, agents, and business partners.\nIn addition, we have been named as a co-defendant with certain other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in a number of class action lawsuits alleging that we engaged in anti-competitive behavior to fix or raise the prices of certain drugs starting, in some instances, as early as June 2013 (refer to Item 8. Note 17). While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, any adverse decision could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nPublishing earnings guidance subjects us to risks, including increased stock volatility, that could lead to potential lawsuits by investors.\nBecause we publish earnings guidance, we are subject to several risks. Actual results may vary from the guidance we provide investors from time to time, such that our stock price may decline following, among other things, any earnings release or guidance that does not meet market expectations.\nIt has become increasingly commonplace for investors to file lawsuits against companies following a rapid decrease in market capitalization. We have been in the past, are currently, and may be in the future, named in these types of lawsuits. These types of lawsuits can be costly and divert management attention and other resources away from our business, regardless of their merits, and could result in adverse settlements or judgments, which could have a material impact on the Company.\nThird-party patents and other intellectual property rights may limit our ability to bring new products to market and may subject us to potential legal liability, causing us to incur significant costs.\nThe manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nAs a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products, the ability of our CSCA, CSCI, and RX segments to bring new products to market is often limited by third-party patents or proprietary rights and regulatory exclusivity periods awarded on products. Launching new products prior to resolution of intellectual property issues may result in us incurring legal liability if the related litigation is later resolved against us. The cost and time for us to develop prescription and Rx-to-OTC switch products is significantly greater than the rest of the new products that we introduce. Any failure to bring new products to market in a timely manner could cause us to lose market share, and our operating results could suffer.\n\u2022\nWe could have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties. This could require us to incur substantial expense and could divert significant effort of our technical and management personnel. If we are found to have infringed on the rights of others, we could lose our right to develop or manufacture some products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Additionally, if we choose to settle a dispute through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products.\n\u2022\nAt times, our CSCA or RX segments may seek approval to market drug products before the expiration of patents for those products, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable or would not be infringed by our products. In these cases, we may face significant patent litigation. Depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors, we may, in certain circumstances, elect to market a generic pharmaceutical product while litigation is pending, before any court decision, or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending, known as an \"at risk\" launch. The risk involved in an \"at risk\" launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails, the remedies available to the patent holder may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the holder, which are often significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product. By electing to proceed in this manner, we could face substantial damages if we receive an adverse final court decision. In the case where a patent holder is able to prove that our infringement was \"willful\" or \"exceptional,\" under applicable law, the patent holder may be awarded up to three times the amount of its actual damages or we may be required to pay attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe success of certain of our products depends on the effectiveness of measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights and patents.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may manufacture and market similar products.\n\u2022\nWe have been issued patents covering certain of our products, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries. Any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us may not provide us with any significant competitive advantages for our products or may even be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by competitors. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using, or commercializing non-infringing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.\n\u2022\nWe also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect, in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees, and consultants. If these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors or, if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, we may not be able to maintain the value of such intellectual property rights.\nSignificant increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of the insurance we maintain could adversely impact our financial condition.\nTo protect the Company against various potential liabilities, we maintain a variety of insurance programs, including property, general, product, and directors' and officers' liability. We may reevaluate and change the types and levels of insurance coverage that we purchase. We are self-insured when insurance is not available or not available at reasonable premiums. Risks associated with insurance plans include:\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nInsurance costs could increase significantly, or the availability of insurance may decrease, either of which could adversely impact our financial condition;\n\u2022\nDeductible or retention amounts could increase, or our coverage could be reduced in the future and to the extent losses occur, there could be an adverse effect on our financial results depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage we maintained;\n\u2022\nInsurance may not be available to us at an economically reasonable cost or our insurance may not adequately cover our liability in connection with claims brought against us; and\n\u2022\nAs our business inherently exposes us to claims, we may become subject to claims for which we are not adequately insured. Unanticipated payment of a large claim may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTax Related Risks\nThe resolution of uncertain tax positions, including the Notices of Proposed Adjustments and Notice of Assessment, could be unfavorable, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that our tax filings are prepared in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit or any related litigation could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made and in future periods after the determination. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties or interest assessments.\nWe are currently involved in several audits and adjustment-related disputes, including related litigation. This includes litigation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan regarding our fiscal years ended June 27, 2009, June 26, 2010, June 25, 2011, and June 30, 2012. The United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan has scheduled a trial date in late May 2020 in response to our complaint filed on August 15, 2017 to recover $163.6 million of Federal income tax, penalties and interest assessed and collected by the IRS. Additionally, the IRS has proposed adjustments regarding the deductibility of interest for the years ended June 29, 2013, June 28, 2014, and June 27, 2015 and the IRS has proposed adjustments regarding litigation costs and transfer pricing positions for Athena Neuroscience, Inc. (\"Athena\"), a subsidiary of Elan acquired in 1996, for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. We are also involved in litigation with Irish Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.\nOn August 22, 2019, we received a draft NOPA from the IRS with respect to our fiscal tax years ended June 28, 2014 and June 27, 2015, relating to the deductibility of interest on $7.5 billion in debts owed to Perrigo Company plc by Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Perrigo Company plc. The debts were incurred in connection with the Elan merger transaction in 2013. The draft NOPA would cap the interest rate on the debts for U.S. federal tax purposes at 130.0% of the Applicable Federal Rate (a blended rate reduction of 4.0% per annum from the rates agreed to by the parties), on the stated ground that the loans were not negotiated on an arms'-length basis. As a result of the proposed interest rate reduction, the draft NOPA proposes a reduction in gross interest expense of approximately $480.0 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. If the IRS were to prevail in its proposed adjustment, we estimate an increase in tax expense for such fiscal years of approximately $170.0 million, excluding interest and penalties. In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the period from June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. If those further adjustments were sustained, based on our preliminary calculations and subject to further analysis, our current best estimate is that the additional tax expense would not exceed $200.0 million, excluding interest and penalties, for the period June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. We do not expect any similar adjustments beyond December 31, 2019 as proposed regulations, issued under section 267A of the Internal Revenue Code, would eliminate the deductibility of interest on this debt. We strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies. No payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made, if at all, until all applicable proceedings have been completed.\nFollowing receipt of the draft NOPA, Perrigo provided the IRS with a detailed written response on September 20, 2019. That submission included an analysis by external advisors that supported the original interest rates as being consistent with arms'-length rates for comparable debt and explained why the exam team\u2019s analyses\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nand conclusions were both factually and legally misguided. Based on discussions with the IRS, we had believed that the IRS staff would take our submission into account and meet with us to discuss whether this issue could be resolved at the examination level. However, in the weeks following such discussions, IRS staff advised that they would not respond in detail to our September submission or negotiate the interest rate issue prior to issuing a final NOPA consistent with the draft NOPA. Accordingly, we currently expect that we will receive a final NOPA regarding this matter that proposes substantially the same adjustments described in the draft NOPA.\nOn April 26, 2019, we received a revised NOPA from the IRS regarding transfer pricing positions related to the IRS audit of Athena for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The NOPA carries forward the IRS's theory from its 2017 draft NOPA that when Elan took over the future funding of Athena\u2019s in-process research and development after acquiring Athena in 1996, Elan should have paid a substantially higher royalty rate for the right to exploit Athena\u2019s intellectual property, rather than rates based on transfer pricing documentation prepared by Elan's external tax advisors. The NOPA proposes a payment of $843.0 million, which represents additional tax and a 40.0% penalty. This amount excludes consideration of offsetting tax attributes and potentially material interest. We strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies, including potentially those available under the U.S. - Ireland Income Tax Treaty to alleviate double taxation. No payment of the additional amounts is required until the matter is resolved administratively, judicially, or through treaty negotiation.\nOn October 30, 2018, we received an audit finding letter from the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioners (\"Irish Revenue\") for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. The audit finding letter relates to the tax treatment of the 2013 sale of the Tysabri\u00ae intellectual property and other assets related to Tysabri\u00ae to Biogen Idec from Elan Pharma. The consideration paid by Biogen to Elan Pharma took the form of an upfront payment and future contingent royalty payments. Irish Revenue issued a Notice of Amended Assessment (\"NoA\") on November 29, 2018, which assesses an Irish corporation tax liability against Elan Pharma in the amount of \u20ac1,636 million, not including interest or any applicable penalties.\nWe disagree with this assessment and believe that the NoA is without merit and incorrect as a matter of law. We filed an appeal of the NoA on December 27, 2018 and will pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues as may be necessary or appropriate. In connection with that, Elan Pharma was granted leave by the Irish High Court on February 25, 2019 to seek judicial review of the issuance of the NoA by Irish Revenue. The judicial review filing is based on our belief that Elan Pharma's legitimate expectations as a taxpayer have been breached, not on the merits of the NoA itself. The High Court has scheduled a hearing in this judicial review proceeding in April 2020, and we would expect a decision in this matter in the second half of 2020. If we are ultimately successful in the judicial review proceedings, the NoA will be invalidated and Irish Revenue will not be able to re-issue the NoA. The proceedings before the Tax Appeals Commission have been stayed until a decision on the judicial review application has been made. If for any reason the judicial review proceedings are ultimately unsuccessful in establishing that Irish Revenue's issuance of the NoA breaches our legitimate expectations, Elan Pharma will reactivate its appeal to challenge the merits of the NoA before the Tax Appeals Commission.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves. We believe that, based on a review of the relevant facts and circumstances, this matter will not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, while we believe our position to be correct, there can be no assurance of an ultimate favorable outcome, and if the matter is ultimately resolved unfavorably it would have a material adverse impact on us, including on liquidity and capital resources. We will consider the financial statement impact of any additional facts as they become available.\nIn addition, going forward, uncertainty regarding the future outcome of tax disputes such as the NoA or draft or final NOPA may have an adverse impact on our strategy and the results of such tax disputes may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.\nAt this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any audit or related litigation. Unfavorable developments in or resolutions of matters such as those discussed above could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods (refer to Item 8, Note 15 for further information related to uncertain tax positions and ongoing tax audits and Item 8. Note 17 for further information related to legal proceedings). In addition, an adverse result with respect to any of these matters could ultimately require the use of\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\ncorporate assets to pay assessments and related interest, penalties or other amounts, and any such use of corporate assets would limit the assets available for other corporate purposes.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") may not agree with the conclusion that we are treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"). For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nFor Perrigo Company plc to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under section 7874 of the Code, either (i) the former stockholders of Perrigo Company must own (within the meaning of section 7874 of the Code) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of our stock by reason of holding shares in Perrigo Company (the \"ownership test\") as of the closing of the Elan acquisition or (ii) we must have substantial business activities in Ireland after the Elan acquisition (taking into account the activities of our expanded affiliated group).\nUpon our acquisition of Elan, Perrigo Company stockholders held 71% (by both vote and value) of our shares. As a result, we believe that under current law, we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, we cannot assure that the IRS will agree with our position that the ownership test is satisfied. There is limited guidance regarding the section 7874 provisions, including the application of the ownership test. An unfavorable determination on Perrigo Company plc\u2019s treatment as a foreign corporation under section 7874 of the Code could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods.\nBased on the limited guidance available, we currently expect that Section 7874 of the Code likely will limit our and our U.S. affiliates\u2019 ability to use their U.S. tax attributes, such as net operating losses, to offset certain U.S. taxable income, if any, generated by the Elan acquisition or certain specified transactions for a period of time following the Elan acquisition (refer to Item 8. Note 15).\nChanges to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nWe believe that under current law, we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, any of the following could adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes:\n\u2022\nChanges to the inversion rules in section 7874 of the Code, the IRS Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or other IRS guidance; and\n\u2022\nLegislative proposals aimed at expanding the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence.\nSince our acquisition of Elan in 2013, the United States Treasury (\"Treasury\") and the IRS have issued a number of Notices and proposed, temporary, and final regulations, including most recently, on July 12, 2018, new final regulations addressing various aspects of section 7874 and related provisions, including guidance to address certain specific post-inversion transactions. All the Notices and regulations are either effective for dates after the Elan acquisition occurred or do not provide guidance that we believe would have a material impact on the treatment of our status as a foreign corporation.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles relating to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"BEPS\"). These changes are being adopted and implemented by many of the countries in which we do business and may increase our tax expense in these countries. For example, Ireland implemented \"controlled foreign corporation legislation\" effective January 1, 2019 as required by the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (\"ATAD\") and effective January 1, 2020 has implemented \"anti-hybrid legislation.\" Such OECD initiatives, changes\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nin domestic legislation, introduction of EU Directives and general global tax reform are actively monitored to ensure we adhere to all laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the U.S. Tax Act. The U.S. Tax Act includes several significant changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us. These changes include a corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, full expensing of fixed assets placed in service in 2018 and the elimination or reduction of certain U.S. deductions and credits, including limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation. The U.S. Tax Act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system. This modified territorial system includes, among other items, base erosion prevention measures which have the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our U.S. owned foreign corporations to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) and the establishment of a minimum tax on certain payments from our U.S. subsidiaries to related foreign persons as base erosion and anti-abuse tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d). These changes became effective in 2018. The U.S. Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated U.S. owned foreign corporations\u2019 previously untaxed foreign earnings (\u201cTransition Toll Tax\u201d). The Transition Toll Tax can be paid over an eight-year period starting in 2018 and will not accrue interest. Based on the 2017 U.S. federal income tax return filed by the Company, the Transition Toll Tax was paid in full with the 2017 U.S. federal income tax return. During 2018, Treasury and the IRS issued various forms of guidance, including notices of proposed rule making and proposed Treasury regulations, implementing and clarifying aspects of the U.S. Tax Act and other related topics, such as:\n\u2022\nTransition Toll Tax;\n\u2022\nBEAT;\n\u2022\nGILTI;\n\u2022\nForeign tax credit computations;\n\u2022\nThe full expensing of fixed assets placed in service in 2018;\n\u2022\nInterest expense limitations under Section 163(j);\n\u2022\nDeductibility of interest and/or royalty payments made by U.S. corporate taxpayers to foreign related parties in so-called \u201chybrid mismatch\u201d arrangements under Section 267A; and\n\u2022\nThe limitation of deductions for key executive compensation as determined under Section 162(m).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we considered and evaluated Treasury and IRS guidance issued as described above and reflected certain changes in our income tax provision for 2018. In 2019, Treasury and the IRS issued final tax regulations (\u201cFinal Regulations\u201d) on certain code sections that were introduced by, or changed as a result of, the U.S. Tax Act. The Final Regulations issued in 2019 did not result in material changes to the tax effect recorded in prior periods when proposed regulations were issued. We will continue to record the tax effects of any further proposed regulations in the quarters in which they are issued.\nOur preliminary estimate of the impact of the U.S. Tax Act (including the Transition Toll Tax) was recorded as of December 31, 2017 and was subject to the finalization of management's analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain U.S. owned foreign subsidiaries and the filing of our tax returns. U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting the U.S. Tax Act required further adjustments and changes in our 2017 estimates, which did not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions. The final determination of the impact of the U.S. Tax Act (including the Transition Toll Tax) was completed in 2018, as required by SAB 118 (refer to Item 8, Note 15).\nAny of these changes could have a prospective or retroactive application to us, our shareholders, and affiliates, and could adversely affect us by changing our effective tax rate and limiting our ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nOur effective tax rate or cash tax payment requirements may change in the future, which could adversely impact our future results from operations.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rate or cash tax payment requirements, which may impact our future results and cash flows from operations (refer to Item 8, Note 15). These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nChanges to tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (including additional proposals for fundamental international tax reform in a number of jurisdictions globally);\n\u2022\nIncome tax rate changes by governments;\n\u2022\nThe jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nChanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nAdjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nAdjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards, treatment or characterization of intercompany transactions, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives;\n\u2022\nChanges in stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022\nChanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022\nExpiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and\n\u2022\nDivestitures of current operations.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic initiatives.\nWe anticipate that cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings available under our credit facilities will substantially fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our business requires continuous capital investments, and there can be no assurance that financial capital will always be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect the business. At December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness outstanding was $3.4 billion.\n\u2022\nOur senior credit facilities, the agreements governing our senior notes, and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied.\n\u2022\nWe also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. These restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions. If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, agreements governing our senior notes, and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable.\n\u2022\nAny default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our senior notes or other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance our debt or obtain sufficient new financing.\n\u2022\nDowngrades to our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase borrowing costs on current or future financing, including via trade payables with vendors. Customers' inclination to purchase goods from us may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of our credit ratings.\n\u2022\nThere are various maturity dates associated with our credit facilities, senior notes, and other debt facilities. There is no assurance that cash, future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. Further, there is no assurance that future refinancing or renegotiation of our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or additional agreements will not have materially different or more stringent terms (refer to Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nWe cannot guarantee that we will buy back our ordinary shares pursuant to our announced share repurchase plan or that our share repurchase plan will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nFollowing the expiration of our 2015 share repurchase plan authorization (the \"2015 Authorization\"), in October 2018 our Board of Directors authorized up to $1.0 billion of share repurchases with no expiration date (the \"2018 Authorization\"), subject to the Board of Directors\u2019 approval of the pricing parameters and amount that may be repurchased under each specific share repurchase program. Through December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 7.8 million ordinary shares through the prior 2015 Authorization. The specific timing and amount of buybacks under the 2018 Authorization, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our ordinary shares, the nature of other investment opportunities and the availability of distributable reserves of Perrigo Company plc. Buybacks of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan could affect the market price of our ordinary shares or increase their volatility. Additionally, our share repurchase plan could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although our share repurchase plan is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so, and short-term share price fluctuations could reduce the plan\u2019s effectiveness.\nAny additional shares we may issue could dilute your ownership in the Company.\n\u2022\nUnder Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders, and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by the articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\n\u2022\nSubject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of a special resolution. Such disapplication of these preemption rights can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares.\n\u2022\nAt our annual general meeting of shareholders in April 2019, our shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to a maximum of 33% of our issued ordinary capital on that date for a period of 18 months from the passing of the resolution. At the annual general meeting, our shareholders also authorized our Board of Directors to issue ordinary shares on a nonpreemptive basis in the following circumstances: (i) an issuance of shares in connection with any rights issuance and (ii) an issuance of shares for cash, if the issuance is limited to up to 5% of the Company\u2019s issued ordinary share capital (with the possibility of issuing an additional 5% of the Company\u2019s issued ordinary share capital provided the Company uses it only in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment that is announced contemporaneously with the issuance, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issuance), bringing the total acceptable limit to 10% of the Company\u2019s issued ordinary share capital. Once these authorizations expire, we cannot provide any assurance that they will be renewed by the shareholders at subsequent annual general meetings, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland; Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014 (the \"Act\"). The Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits, and indemnification of directors.\n\u2022\nUnder Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. As a result, shareholders of Irish companies do not have the right to bring an action against the directors or officers of a company, except in limited circumstances.\n\u2022\nDepending on the circumstances, shareholders may be subject to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law as a result of the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of ordinary shares, including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax, Irish income tax, and capital acquisitions tax.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nThere is no treaty between Ireland and the U.S. providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. Before a foreign judgment would be deemed enforceable in Ireland, the judgment must be (i) for a definite sum, (ii) provided by a court of competent jurisdiction and (iii) final and conclusive. An Irish High Court may exercise its right to refuse to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if it violated Irish public policy, if it is in breach of natural justice, or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment.\n\u2022\nAn Irish High Court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Judgments of U.S. courts of liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish High Courts if deemed to be contrary to public policy in Ireland.\n\u2022\nIt could be more difficult for us to obtain shareholder approval for a merger or negotiated transaction than if we were a U.S. company because the shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions differ, and in some cases are greater, under Irish law.\nIrish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. with respect to defending unwanted takeover proposals and may give our Board of Directors less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors.\nWe are subject to the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules, 2013. Under those Irish Takeover Rules, the Board of Directors is not permitted to take any action that might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once the Board of Directors has received an approach that may lead to an offer or has reason to believe that such an offer is or may be imminent, subject to certain exceptions. Potentially frustrating actions such as (i) the issuance of ordinary shares, options or convertible securities, (ii) material acquisitions or disposals, (iii) entering into contracts other than in the ordinary course of business, or (iv) any action, other than seeking alternative offers, which may result in frustration of an offer, are prohibited during the course of an offer or at any earlier time during which the Board of Directors has reason to believe an offer is or may be imminent. These provisions may give the Board of Directors less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors and protect the interests of holders of ordinary shares than would be the case for a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.\nWe may be limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future.\nA number of factors may limit our ability to pay dividends in the future, including:\n\u2022\nOur ability to receive cash dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nCompliance with applicable laws and debt covenants;\n\u2022\nOur financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant; and\n\u2022\nThe availability of Perrigo Company plc's distributable reserves, being profits of the company available for distribution to shareholders.\nUnder Irish law, distributable reserves are the accumulated realized profits so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less accumulated realized losses so far as not previously written off in a reduction or a reorganization of capital duly made. In addition, no distribution or dividend may be made if, at the time of the distribution or dividend, Perrigo Company plc's net assets are not, or would not be after giving effect to such distribution or dividend, equal to, or in excess of, the aggregate of Perrigo Company plc's called-up share capital plus undistributable reserves.\nWhile we currently expect to continue paying dividends, significant changes in our business or financial condition such as asset impairments, sustained operating losses and the selling of assets, could impact the amount of distributable reserves available to us. We could seek to create additional distributable reserves through a reduction in Perrigo Company plc's share premium, which would require 75% shareholder approval and the approval of the Irish High Court. The Irish High Court\u2019s approval is a matter for the discretion of the court, and there can be no assurances that such approval would be obtained. In the event that additional distributable reserves are not created in this way, dividends, share repurchases or other distributions would generally not be permitted under Irish law until such time as Perrigo Company plc has created sufficient distributable reserves in our audited statutory financial statements as a result of its business activities.", "PERMNO": 77182, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRGO"}
