The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIndustry Specific Risk Factors\nOvercapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRecent additions of new steelmaking capacity and the decrease in steel production due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused excess steelmaking capacity to grow during the last two years after several years of decline. According to the OECD, global steel production overcapacity is projected to be approximately 776 million tons in 2020. China continues to be a significant contributor to excess steelmaking capacity.\nDuring periods of global economic weakness, this overcapacity is amplified because of weaker global demand for steel and steel products. This excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. In some countries the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. These imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency conversion rates, and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSection 232 steel tariffs are currently keeping some dumped steel products out of the U.S. market. The U.S. government has also been negotiating new trade agreements with many countries, including China, which may provide another opportunity to address excess steelmaking capacity. Should these efforts be abandoned or fail to reduce the impact of global excess capacity and the Section 232 tariffs be lifted, U.S. steelmakers would be at greater risk of having to compete against steel products dumped in the U.S. market.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements.\nOur operations are capital intensive. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, our total capital expenditures were approximately $4.04 billion. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. Although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds, short-term commercial paper issuance, offerings of our debt and equity securities or from borrowings under our $1.50 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case. Additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources.\nChanges in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business.\nOur steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. In addition, our DRI facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by weather, political, regulatory and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover increased energy costs. Disruptions, including physical or information systems related\nissues, that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. Increases in our energy costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompetition from other steel producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business.\nWe face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price, quality and service. The steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel, steel products and raw materials markets. Depending on a variety of factors, including the cost and availability of raw materials, energy, technology, labor and capital costs, currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces.\nIn many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood. Increased use of these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products.\nSince 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new Corporate Average Fuel Economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. As automobile producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may seek to reduce the amount of steel they incorporate in their vehicles or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing their demand for steel. Certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015.\nOur industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business.\nDemand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Our business supports cyclical industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. As a result, downturns in the U.S. economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The U.S. economy is recovering from its lows during the second quarter of 2020, but the pace of the recovery in 2021 will likely depend on how quickly the U.S. population is vaccinated and normal activities can resume as well as government stimulus programs or infrastructure spending. Even with this economic recovery, challenges from global production overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing uncertainties, both in the United States and in other regions of the world, remain.\nWe are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions. Future economic downturns, prolonged slow growth or stagnation in the economy, or a sector-specific slowdown in one of our key end-use markets, such as nonresidential construction, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, especially in light of the capital-intensive nature of our business.\nThe results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel.\nWe rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of our steel products. The raw material required to produce DRI is pelletized iron ore. Although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana and also by acquiring DJJ in 2008, we still must purchase most of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the United States and internationally.\nAlthough we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap, scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors, as well as currency fluctuations. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. The availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. Many countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. This trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to compete in the U.S. market.\nIf our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. Also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, experience margin compressions or suffer harm to our reputation.\nOur steelmaking processes, our DRI processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other GHGs. The regulation of these GHGs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, and, accordingly, we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. There are inherent uncertainties in these estimates. Most notably, the uncertainty of policies, enforcement priorities, legislation and regulations related to climate change mitigation strategies pose the greatest risk.\nAs a carbon steel producer, Nucor could be increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if carbon policy decisions and mandates are not properly implemented. Carbon is an essential raw material in Nucor\u2019s steel production processes. Furthermore, Nucor steel mills utilize EAFs for 100% of their steel melting operations and the costs associated with the decarbonization of electricity generation is a significant concern. Significant new rulemaking or legislation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEnvironmental regulation compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position.\nWe incur significant costs in meeting our environmental regulation compliance and remediation obligations. The principal federal environmental laws include the CAA, that regulates air emissions; the CWA that regulates water withdrawals and discharges; RCRA, that addresses solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal; and CERCLA, that governs releases of hazardous substances, and remediation of contaminated sites. Our operations are also subject to state and local environmental laws and regulations. Capital expenditures at our facilities that are associated with environmental regulation compliance for 2021 and 2022 are estimated to be less than $100 million per year.\nIn addition to the above mentioned statutes, certain revisions to National Air Ambient Quality Standards could make it significantly more difficult for us to obtain construction permits and permits to expand existing operations. Resulting cancellations, delays or unanticipated costs to these projects could negatively impact our ability to generate expected returns on our investments. These regulations can also increase our cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. We may in the future incur substantially increased costs complying with such regulations, particularly if federal regulatory agencies were to change their enforcement posture with respect to such regulations.\nEmerging customer preferences for greater product transparency and less GHG intensive materials may put us at a competitive disadvantage or reduce demand for our products.\nNumerous states, including Washington, Oregon and New York, are considering establishing requirements for Environmental Product Declarations (\u201cEPDs\u201d) to evaluate environmental impacts of products. California has enacted the \u201cBuy Clean California Act\u201d and California has established Global Warming Potential (GWP) benchmarks through EPDs for certain materials, including certain steel products. Currently, the federal government is considering similar legislation. EPD legislation has the potential to put domestic steel manufacturers at a disadvantage to foreign competitors unless standardized mechanisms are used to fully evaluate products produced by foreign steel producers.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, as well as similar epidemics and public health emergencies in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics and other public health emergencies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which spread from China to many other countries including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency.\nWe are a company operating in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. As such, Nucor was deemed an essential or life-sustaining operation and, accordingly, is currently able to maintain operations sufficient to meet our customers\u2019 ongoing needs. In spite of our continued operations, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may compress our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. The COVID-19 pandemic is a widespread public health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies of many countries and caused periodic disruption to financial markets. Any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and raw materials. The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic could also negatively impact our business or results of operations through the temporary closure of our operating facilities or those of our customers or suppliers.\nIn addition, the ability of our teammates and our suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 teammates to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19. Our customers may be directly impacted by business interruptions or weak market conditions and may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations. Furthermore, the progression of and global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to cause and increases the risk of further delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, including potential delays in obtaining permits from government agencies. The extent of such delays and other effects of COVID-19 on our capital projects, certain of which are outside of our control, is unknown, but they could impact or delay the timing of anticipated benefits on capital projects.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the pandemic, the availability of a vaccine, evolving strains of the virus, and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate the effects of the pandemic. The current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nWe are subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such as intellectual property and proprietary business information. Despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures could\nresult in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches of our systems or those of our third-party service providers. These risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information or personal data or reputational damage or could adversely affect our ability to physically produce steel, resulting in lost revenues, as well as delays in reporting our financial results. We also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach, including to repair or replace networks and information technology systems. We may also contend with potential liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses.\nThe steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. While our insurance coverage could offset a portion of the losses relating to some of those types of events, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent that any such losses are not covered by our insurance, or that there are significant delays in resolving our claims with our insurance providers.\nWe acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire.\nWe plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that strengthen Nucor. Realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses.\nRisks associated with operating in international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nCertain of our businesses and investments are located outside of the United States, in Canada, Mexico and in emerging markets. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. These risks include, but are not limited to: unfavorable political or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA). These risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\nThe accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings.\nWe periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. The results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates, commodity prices and general economic conditions. If we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations.\nTax increases and changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe steel industry and our business are sensitive to changes in taxes. As a company based in the United States, Nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in U.S. tax laws than some of our major competitors. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws.\nNucor recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are believed to be more likely than not of being sustained. We cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit challenging any of our tax positions and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any challenges. If we are unsuccessful in any of these matters, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.\nWe spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time.", "PERMNO": 34817, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "NUE"}
