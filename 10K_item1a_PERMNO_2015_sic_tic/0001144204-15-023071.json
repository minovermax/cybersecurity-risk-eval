RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. We operate in an industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are seeking to develop antibacterial agents using bacteriophage technology, which has not resulted in any approved product on the market to date.\nWe are developing our product candidates with bacteriophage technology. We have not, nor to our knowledge has any other company, received regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or equivalent foreign agencies for a pharmaceutical drug based on this approach. While in vitro studies have characterized the behavior of bacteriophages in cell cultures and there exists a body of literature regarding the use of phage therapy in humans, the safety and efficacy of phage therapy in humans has not been extensively studied in well-controlled modern clinical trials. Most of the prior research on phage-based therapy was conducted in the former Soviet Union prior to and immediately after World War II and lacked appropriate control group design or lacked control groups at all. Furthermore, the standard of care has changed substantially during the ensuing decades since those studies were performed, making claims of improved cure rates open for debate. We cannot be certain that our approach will lead to the development of approvable or marketable drugs.\nDeveloping phage-based therapies on a commercial scale will also require developing new manufacturing processes and techniques. We and our third-party collaborators may experience delays in developing manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates, and may not be able to do so at the scale required to conduct efficiently the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval of our products, or to manufacture commercial quantities of our products, if approved.\nIn addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs based on these targeting approaches, which could lengthen the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates.\nDelays in our clinical trials could result in us not achieving anticipated developmental milestones when expected, increased costs and delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates.\nDelays in our ability to commence or enroll patients for our clinical trials could result in us not meeting anticipated clinical milestones and could materially impact our product development costs and delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will be commenced or completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 delays in the development of manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates to enable their consistent production at clinical trial scale;\n\u00b7 delays in the commencement of clinical trials as a result of clinical trial holds or the need to obtain additional information to complete an Investigational New Drug Application (IND);\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence new trials;\n\u00b7 adverse safety events experienced during our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining clinical materials;\n\u00b7 slower than expected patient recruitment for participation in clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms with prospective sites or obtaining institutional review board approval.\nIf we do not successfully commence or complete our clinical trials on schedule, the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe have not completed formulation development of any of our product candidates.\nThe development of our bacteriophage product candidates requires that we isolate, select and combine a number of bacteriophage that target the desired bacteria for that product candidate. The selection of bacteriophage for any of our product candidates is based on a variety of factors, including without limitation the ability of the selected phages, in combination, to successfully kill the targeted bacteria, the degree of cross-reactivity of the individual phages with the same part of the bacterial targets, the ability of the combined phages to satisfy regulatory requirements, our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the phages, intellectual property rights of third parties, and other factors. While we have selected an initial formulation of AmpliPhage-002 for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections, there can be no assurance that this will be the final formulation of AmpliPhage-002 for commercialization. In addition, we are still finalizing initial formulations of AmpliPhage-001 and AmpliPhage-004. If we are unable to complete formulation development of our product candidates in the time frame that we have anticipated, then our product development timelines, and the regulatory approval of our product candidates, could be delayed.\nWe must hire a new chief executive officer and additional members of our senior management team.\nBy mutual agreement of the Board of Directors of the Company and Philip J. Young, Mr. Young stepped down from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company in September 2014. We are looking to replace Mr. Young with a new Chief Executive Officer, and in the interim, Jeremy Curnock Cook, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, is acting as interim Chief Executive Officer, and Wendy Johnson, a member of our Board of Directors, is acting as interim Chief Operating Officer. If we are unable to find a suitable Chief Executive Officer, we may have difficulty executing our business plans, which could cause delays in the commencement of clinical trials or other business activities. The change in Chief Executive Officer may also make it difficult to retain other personnel and the loss of additional personnel could also have an adverse impact on our business and operations. We are also looking to appoint a new Chief Operating Officer and add additional members to the Company\u2019s management team, including the possible additions of senior staff to manage key functions in research, clinical, and non-clinical development. If we do not hire additional senior management personnel, we may not be able to effectively manage our business and operations.\nWe must raise additional capital to continue operations.\nOur consolidated financial statements were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern. However, we have had recurring losses from operations, negative operating cash flow and an accumulated deficit.\nIn December 2013, we completed a private placement of shares of our common stock, which raised approximately $18.0 million, prior to commissions. In March 2015, we completed a private placement of shares of our common stock and warrants, which raised approximately $13 million, prior to commissions. We do not generate any cash from operations and must raise additional funds in order to continue operating our business. We expect to continue to fund our operations primarily through equity and debt financings in the future. If additional capital is not available, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may have to discontinue our operations entirely. We believe that we have adequate capital to fund operations through the second quarter of 2016.\nDeveloping drugs and conducting clinical trials is expensive. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of our research and development activities;\n\u00b7 the progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u00b7 the cost and timing of securing manufacturing capabilities for our clinical product candidates and commercial products, if any;\n\u00b7 the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, acquisition or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent applications, claims, patents and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7 the costs of lawsuits involving us or our product candidates.\nWe will seek additional capital to support our product development activities. We may seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to the products candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into any such arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources, including:\n\u00b7 the public equity market;\n\u00b7 private equity financing;\n\u00b7 collaborative arrangements;\n\u00b7 licensing arrangements; and/or\n\u00b7 public or private debt.\nOur ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on the status of our product development activities and other business operations, as well as factors related to financial, economic, and market conditions, collaboration or license agreement with others and factors related to financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Raising additional capital through the sale of securities could cause significant dilution to our stockholders. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through additional arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products, technologies or potential markets, any of which could delay or require that we curtail or eliminate some or all of our development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research and development, which could delay the time to market for any of our product candidates, if adequate funds are not available.\nIf we are unable to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects, to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity. Insufficient funds may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our activities, and if we are unable to obtain additional funding, there is uncertainty regarding our continued existence.\nPreclinical studies and Phase 1 or 2 clinical trials of our product candidates may not predict the results of subsequent human clinical trials.\nPreclinical studies, including studies of our product candidates in animal models of disease, may not accurately predict the result of human clinical trials of those product candidates. In particular, promising animal studies suggesting the efficacy of prototype phage products in the treatment of bacterial infections, such as P. aeruginosa, may not predict the ability of these products to treat similar infections in humans. Our phage technology may be found not to be efficacious in treating bacterial infections alone or in combination with other agents, when studied in human clinical trials.\nTo satisfy FDA or foreign regulatory approval standards for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate in adequate and controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective. Success in early clinical trials, including Phase 2 trials, does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Our initial results from Phase 1/2 clinical trials also may not be confirmed by later analysis or subsequent larger clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nOur product candidates must undergo rigorous clinical testing, the results of which are uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from bringing them to market.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials of new drug candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete.\nWe cannot be certain of successfully completing clinical testing within the time frame we have planned, or at all. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates, including the following:\n\u00b7 our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing or to abandon programs;\n\u00b7 the results obtained in earlier stage clinical testing may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials;\n\u00b7 clinical trial results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7 enrollment in our clinical trials for our product candidates may be slower than we anticipate, resulting in significant delays and additional expense;\n\u00b7 we, or regulators, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and\n\u00b7 the effects of our product candidates on patients may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that may delay or preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use, if approved.\nCompletion of clinical trials depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients, which is a function of many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the therapeutic endpoints chosen for evaluation;\n\u00b7 the eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u00b7 the perceived benefit of the investigational drug under study;\n\u00b7 the size of the patient population required for analysis of the clinical trial\u2019s therapeutic endpoints;\n\u00b7 our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators and sites with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u00b7 competition for patients by clinical trial programs for other treatments.\nWe may experience difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, which could increase the costs or affect the timing or outcome of these clinical trials. This is particularly true with respect to diseases with relatively small patient populations.\nWe must develop manufacturing processes for our lead product candidates and any delay in or our inability to do so would result in delays in our clinical trials and materially and negatively affect our business and results.\nWe are developing novel manufacturing processes for the production of AmpliPhage-002 for treatment of S. aureus (MRSA) infections, AmpliPhage-001for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections and AmpliPhage-004 for the treatment of C. difficile infections at facilities in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The manufacturing processes for our product candidates, and the scale up of such processes for clinical trials, is novel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete this work in a timely manner, if at all. Any delay in the development or scale up of these manufacturing processes could delay the start of clinical trials and harm our business. Our facilities in Slovenia must also undergo inspections by JAZMP, the Slovenian agency that regulates and supervises pharmaceutical products in Slovenia, for compliance with their and the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practice regulations, or cGMP regulations, before the respective product candidates can be approved for use in clinical trials or commercialization. As a result of an initial inspection, we are taking certain non-critical corrective actions regarding the manufacture of AmpliPhage-002, which we believe will lead to certification by JAZMP to manufacture AmpliPhage-002; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive or maintain such certification. We will also be subject to additional inspections for GMP compliance for our other product candidates, and may be subject to additional inspections for AmpliPhage-002. In the event these facilities do not receive a satisfactory cGMP inspection for the manufacture of our product candidates, we may need to fund additional modifications to our manufacturing process, conduct additional validation studies, or find alternative manufacturing facilities, any of which would result in significant cost to us as well as a delay of up to several years in obtaining approval for such product candidate.\nOur manufacturing facilities will be subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the European regulatory authorities, including JAZMP, and the FDA for compliance with European and FDA cGMP regulations. Compliance with these regulations and standards is complex and costly, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed (including fines, injunctions and civil penalties), failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nWe have conducted and may in the future conduct clinical trials for our products or product candidates outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nWe have conducted and may in the future choose to conduct one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of such study data by the FDA is subject to certain conditions. For example, the study must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The study population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical studies conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to label the product in the United States. In addition, such studies would be subject to the applicable local laws and FDA acceptance of the data would be dependent upon its determination that the studies also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept any such data, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time consuming and delay aspects of our business plan.\nWe may need to license additional intellectual property rights.\nThe development and commercialization of phage-based antibacterial agents may require us to obtain rights to intellectual property from third parties. For example, pursuant to our Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, we are focusing on developing bacteriophage therapeutics to treat S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa infections. To the extent the intellectual property is generated from the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command or Walter Reed Army Institute of Research that is used in a commercial product, we may be obligated to make payments such as royalties, licensing fees and milestone payments. We may also determine that it is necessary or advisable to license other intellectual property from third parties. There can be no assurance that such intellectual property rights would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe are subject to significant regulatory approval requirements, which could delay, prevent or limit our ability to market our product candidates.\nOur research and development activities, preclinical studies, clinical trials and the anticipated manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in Europe and elsewhere. For example, our research facilities in Colworth, United Kingdom, failed an audit by the Health and Safety Executive, Britain\u2019s national regulatory for workplace health and safety; as a result of this failure we have elected to reconfigure our research operations. There can be no assurance that our planned manufacturing facilities will satisfy the requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign authorities. We require the approval of the relevant regulatory authorities before we may commence commercial sales of our product candidates in a given market. The regulatory approval process is expensive and time-consuming, and the timing of receipt of regulatory approval is difficult to predict. Our product candidates could require a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than expected, or may never gain approval. We cannot be certain that, even after expending substantial time and financial resources, we will obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. A delay or denial of regulatory approval could delay or prevent our ability to generate product revenues and to achieve profitability.\nChanges in regulatory approval policies during the development period of any of our product candidates, changes in, or the enactment of, additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review practices for a submitted product application may cause a delay in obtaining approval or result in the rejection of an application for regulatory approval.\nRegulatory approval, if obtained, may be made subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market a product. These limitations could adversely affect our potential product revenues. Regulatory approval may also require costly post-marketing follow-up studies. In addition, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping related to the product will be subject to extensive ongoing regulatory requirements. Furthermore, for any marketed product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, among other things, result in fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, product seizures, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses and marketing of pharmaceutical products.\nFDA rules for pharmaceutical promotion require that a company not promote an unapproved drug or an approved drug for an unapproved use. In addition to FDA requirements, regulatory and law enforcement agencies, such as the United States Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General and the United States Department of Justice, monitor and investigate pharmaceutical sales, marketing and other practices. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Act, as amended, the False Claims Act, as amended, and similar state laws. In recent years, actions by companies\u2019 sales forces and marketing departments have been scrutinized intensely to ensure, among other things, that actions by such groups do not qualify as \u201ckickbacks\u201d to healthcare professionals. A \u201ckickback\u201d refers to the provision of any item of value to a healthcare professional or other person in exchange for purchasing, recommending, or referring an individual for an item or service reimbursable by a federal healthcare program. These kickbacks increase the expenses of the federal healthcare program and may result in civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, and exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which would adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. In addition, even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which would also harm our financial condition. Comparable laws also exist at the state level.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. As a biotechnology company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. The Federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute will constrain our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nThe federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations. Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to new federal and state requirements to submit information on our open and completed clinical trials to public registries and databases.\nIn 1997, a public registry of open clinical trials involving drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions was established under the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, or FDMA, in order to promote public awareness of and access to these clinical trials. Under FDMA, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other clinical trial sponsors are required to post the general purpose of these clinical trials, as well as the eligibility criteria, location and contact information of the clinical trials. Since the establishment of this registry, there has been significant public debate focused on broadening the types of clinical trials included in this or other registries, as well as providing for public access to clinical trial results. A voluntary coalition of medical journal editors has adopted a resolution to publish results only from those clinical trials that have been registered with a no-cost, publicly accessible database, such as www.clinicaltrials.gov. The Pharmaceuticals and Research Manufacturers of America has also issued voluntary principles for its members to make results from certain clinical trials publicly available and has established a website for this purpose. Other groups have adopted or are considering similar proposals for clinical trial registration and the posting of clinical trial results. The state of Maine has enacted legislation, with penalty provisions, requiring the disclosure of results from clinical trials involving drugs marketed in the state, and similar legislation has been introduced in other states. Federal legislation was introduced in the fall of 2004 to expand www.clinicaltrials.gov and to require the inclusion of clinical trial results in this registry. In some states, such as New York, prosecutors have alleged that a lack of disclosure of clinical trial information constitutes fraud, and these allegations have resulted in settlements with pharmaceutical companies that include agreements to post clinical trial results. Our failure to comply with any clinical trial posting requirements could expose us to negative publicity, fines, and other penalties, all of which could materially harm our business.\nWe do not have a sales force and do not currently have plans to develop one.\nThe commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon the strength of sales and marketing efforts for them. We do not have a sales force and have no experience in sales, marketing or distribution. To successfully commercialize our product candidates, we will need to develop such a capability ourselves or seek assistance from a third party with a large distribution system and a large direct sales force. We may be unable to put such a plan in place. In addition, if we arrange for others to market and sell our products, our revenues will depend upon the efforts of those parties. Such arrangements may not succeed. Even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for marketing, if we fail to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur success depends in part on attracting, retaining and motivating our personnel.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions, clinicians and scientists.\nOur former President and Chief Executive Officer stepped down from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2014 and Mr. Curnock Cook, our Chairman, has been serving since then as Interim Chief Executive Officer. We currently have a search underway for a new Chief Executive Officer to replace Mr. Curnock Cook. Our inability to hire a new Chief Executive Officer, along with the loss of the services of other key employees, could delay or have an impact on the successful completion of our clinical trials or the development of additional product candidates.\nAs of April 3, 2015, we had twenty-three employees. Our success will depend on our ability to retain and motivate remaining personnel and hire additional qualified personnel when required. Competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense. We face competition for personnel from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities, public and private research institutions and other organizations. We also face competition from other more well-funded and well-established businesses and we may also be viewed as a riskier choice from a job stability perspective due to our relative newer status than longer existing biotech and pharmaceutical companies. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our retention, motivation and recruitment efforts, we may be unable to execute our business strategy.\nWe must manage a geographically dispersed organization.\nWhile we are a small company, we currently have operations in the United States, Australia and Slovenia. In the future, we may also locate facilities in other locations based on proximity to personnel with the expertise needed to research, develop and manufacture phage-based therapeutics, costs of operations or other factors. Managing our organization across multiple locations and multiple time zones may reduce our efficiency, increase our expenses and increase the risk of operational difficulties in the execution of our plans.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance and Operations\nWe have incurred losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and our future profitability is uncertain.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 1992. Prior to the merger of Targeted Genetics Corporation with Biocontrol in January 2011, our accumulated deficit was $315.5 million, and Biocontrol had an accumulated deficit of $6.9 million. Since January 2011, we have incurred a cumulative deficit of $46.5 million, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have devoted, and will continue to devote for the foreseeable future, substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had an operating loss of $12.4 million and a net loss of $64.6 million, including a non-cash loss on warrant and derivative liabilities of $49.3 million and a non-cash charge of $3.0 million related to common shares issued for a technology access fee. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had an operating loss of $14.1 million and a net income of $23.1 million, including a non-cash gain on warrant and derivative liabilities of $37.2 million. Additional information regarding our results of operations may be found in our consolidated financial statements and in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\nClinical trials and activities associated with discovery research are costly. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term, and we expect to continue to have significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nTo attain ongoing profitability, we will need to develop products successfully and market and sell them effectively, or rely on other parties to do so. We cannot predict when we will achieve ongoing profitability, if at all. We have never generated revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. If we fail to become profitable, or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses, we would be unable to continue our research and development programs.\nOur success depends in part on retaining and motivating key personnel and, if we fail to do so, it may be more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. As a small organization we are dependent on key employees and may need to hire additional personnel to execute our business strategy successfully.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions, clinicians and scientists.\nOur former President and Chief Executive Officer stepped down from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2014 and Mr. Curnock Cook, our Chairman, has been serving since then as Interim Chief Executive Officer. We currently have a search underway for a new Chief Executive Officer to replace Mr. Curnock Cook. Our inability to hire the new Chief Executive Officer, along with the loss of the services of other key employees, could delay or have an impact on the successful completion of our clinical trials or the development of additional product candidates.\nAs of April 3, 2015, we had twenty-three employees. Our success will depend on our ability to retain and motivate remaining personnel and hire additional qualified personnel when required. Competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense. We face competition for personnel from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities, public and private research institutions and other organizations. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our retention, motivation and recruitment efforts, we may be unable to execute our business strategy.\nWe may be required to make cash payments to the holders of our Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock if the holders elect to receive payment for the Series B dividends in cash.\nThe holders of our shares of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive a cumulative dividend at the rate of 10% per annum, payable in cash at the option of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. If such holders elect to receive payment for such dividends in cash, we will have less cash available, which will have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe have determined that a material weakness existed in our system of internal control over financial reporting, which could have had a material impact on our business.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting adequate to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the quarters ended March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014, we determined that we had a material weakness as of December 31, 2014, namely that our controls over the evaluation and review of complex and non-routine transactions were not effective.\nDue to this material weakness, we have concluded that as of December 31, 2014, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we have restated our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014 to correct for errors caused by this weakness.\nWe do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As a result, we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. A material weakness means a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties for aspects of product development.\nWe rely on third parties such as the University of Leicester and the U.S Army for certain aspects of product development. We are working with the University of Leicester for research and development of product candidates to treat C. difficile infections. We are working with the U.S. Army for research and development of product candidates to treat S. aureus infections, and we are working with Intrexon to develop new strains of manufacturing hosts for our phage therapies. Because we rely on third parties to conduct these activities, we have less control over the success of these programs than we would if we were conducting them on our own. Factors beyond our control that could impact the success of these programs include the amount of resources devoted to the programs by the applicable third party, the staffing of those projects by third-party personnel, and the amount of time such personnel devote to our programs compared to other programs. Failure of our third-party collaborators to successfully complete the projects that we are working on with them could result in delays in product development and the need to expend additional resources, increasing our expenses beyond current expectations.\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct some of our clinical trials, and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely or competent manner may delay development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe expect to use third parties, such as clinical research organizations or the U.S Army, to assist in conducting our clinical trials. There are numerous alternative sources to provide these services. However, we may face delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely or competent fashion or if we are forced to change service providers. This risk is heightened for clinical trials conducted outside of the United States, where it may be more difficult to ensure that clinical trials are conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. Any third-party that we hire to conduct clinical trials may also provide services to our competitors, which could compromise the performance of their obligations to us. If we experience significant delays in the progress of our clinical trials and in our plans to file New Drug Applications, the commercial prospects for product candidates could be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue would be delayed or prevented.\nWe will rely on the U.S. Army to conduct our Phase 1 clinical trial, and their failure to perform in a timely manner may significantly delay the AmpliPhage-002 clinical program\nPursuant to our Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, we expect to utilize U.S. Army human resources and facilities to conduct our planned Phase 1 clinical trial of AmpliPhage-002. Due to recent outbreaks of the Ebola virus, the Army has diverted significant resources to studying this potential epidemic. As a result, the U.S. Army has advised the Company that there may be a delay in initiating the planned Phase 1 AmpliPhage-002 study, which may significantly affect our ability to conduct this clinical trial prior to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are dependent on patents and proprietary technology. If we fail to adequately protect this intellectual property or if we otherwise do not have exclusivity for the marketing of our products, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection sufficient to prevent others from marketing our product candidates, as well as to defend and enforce these patents against infringement and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Protection of our product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties will depend on having valid and enforceable patents cover our product candidates or their manufacture or use, or having effective trade secret protection. If our patent applications do not result in issued patents, or if our patents are found to be invalid, we will lose the ability to exclude others from making, using or selling the inventions claimed therein. We have a limited number of patents and pending patent applications.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. This is due to inconsistent application of policy and changes in policy relating to examination and enforcement of biotechnology patents to date on a global scale. The laws of some countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of countries having well-established patent systems, and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. Also, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We are not able to guarantee that all of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents and we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed in our patent applications or in the patent applications we may license from others.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u00b7 we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents, and we may have to participate in expensive and protracted interference proceedings to determine priority of invention;\n\u00b7 we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7 others may independently develop similar or alternative product candidates to any of our product candidates that fall outside the scope of our patents;\n\u00b7 our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 our issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7 others may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products that fall outside the scope of our patents;\n\u00b7 we may not develop additional patentable proprietary technologies related to our product candidates; and\n\u00b7 we are dependent upon the diligence of our appointed agents in national jurisdictions, acting for and on our behalf, which control the prosecution of pending domestic and foreign patent applications and maintain granted domestic and foreign patents.\nAn issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our patented technology. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing the same or related product candidates or could limit the length of the term of patent protection of our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Patent term extensions may not be available for these patents.\nWe rely on trade secrets and other forms of non-patent intellectual property protection. If we are unable to protect our trade secrets, other companies may be able to compete more effectively against us.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, including our proprietary processes for manufacturing and purifying bacteriophages. Trade secrets are difficult to protect, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, where much of the information about a product must be made public during the regulatory approval process. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secret information is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to or may not protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or if we are forced to engage in an interference proceeding, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation or interference would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to commercialize our product candidates depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous United States and foreign patents and patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the general field of anti-infective products or in fields that otherwise may relate to our product candidates. If we are shown to infringe, we could be enjoined from use or sale of the claimed invention if we are unable to prove that the patent is invalid. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe, or which may trigger an interference proceeding regarding one of our owned or licensed patents or applications. There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that our product candidates may inadvertently infringe or which may become involved in an interference proceeding.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. For so long as our product candidates are in clinical trials, we believe our clinical activities fall within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As our clinical investigational drug product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. While we attempt to ensure that our active clinical investigational drugs and the methods we employ to manufacture them, as well as the methods for their use we intend to promote, do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights, we cannot be certain they do not, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nWe may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our product candidates, or the methods we employ to manufacture them, or the uses for which we intend to promote them, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Our ability to manufacture and commercialize our product candidates may depend on our ability to demonstrate that the manufacturing processes we employ and the use of our product candidates do not infringe third-party patents. If third-party patents were found to cover our product candidates or their use or manufacture, we could be required to pay damages or be enjoined and therefore unable to commercialize our product candidates, unless we obtained a license. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nIf our competitors are able to develop and market products that are more effective, safer or more affordable than ours, or obtain marketing approval before we do, our commercial opportunities may be limited.\nCompetition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense and continues to increase. Some companies that are larger and have significantly more resources than we do are aggressively pursuing antibacterial development programs, including traditional therapies and therapies with novel mechanisms of action. In addition, other companies are developing phage-based products for non-therapeutic uses, and may elect to use their expertise in phage development and manufacturing to try to develop products that would compete with ours.\nWe also face potential competition from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions engaged in the discovery and development of drugs and therapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing, sales and marketing than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical companies.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective, have fewer side effects and are safer or more affordable than our product candidates, which would render our product candidates less competitive or noncompetitive. These competitors also compete with us to recruit and retain qualified scientific and management personnel, establish clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as to acquire technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. Moreover, competitors that are able to achieve patent protection, obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before we do, and competitors that have already done so, may enjoy a significant competitive advantage.\nIn July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act was passed, which included the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act. The GAIN Act is intended to provide incentives for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products. These incentives may result in more competition in the market for new antibiotics, and may cause pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with more resources than we have to shift their efforts towards the development of products that could be competitive with our product candidates.\nThere is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If we do not obtain sufficient liability insurance, a product liability claim could result in substantial liabilities.\nOur business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 delay or failure to complete our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation;\n\u00b7 litigation costs;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards against us; and\n\u00b7 diversion of management or other resources from key aspects of our operations.\nIf we succeed in marketing products, product liability claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety or efficacy of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs. An FDA investigation could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, or limitations on the indications, for which they may be used, or suspension or withdrawal of approval.\nWe have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials up to a $10 million annual aggregate limit. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for our product candidates or any other compound that we may develop. However, insurance coverage is expensive and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all, and the insurance coverage that we obtain may not be adequate to cover potential claims or losses.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the market may not be receptive to our product candidates upon their commercial introduction, which would negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability.\nOur product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of the product;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7 potential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7 the price of the product, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments; and\n\u00b7 sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf our product candidates receive regulatory approval but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate product revenues sufficient to attain profitability.\nIf third-party payors do not adequately reimburse patients for any of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, we may not be successful in selling them.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from governmental and other third-party payors, both in the United States and in foreign markets. Even if we succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, the amount reimbursed for our products may be insufficient to allow us to compete effectively and could adversely affect our profitability.\nReimbursement by a governmental and other third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including a governmental or other third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u00b7 a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7 safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u00b7 appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7 cost-effective; and\n\u00b7 neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each third-party and governmental payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to obtain reimbursement.\nEligibility for coverage does not imply that any drug product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not become permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost drugs that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or Medicare or Medicaid data used to calculate these rates. Net prices for products also may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or by any future relaxation of laws that restrict imports of certain medical products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.\nThe healthcare industry is experiencing a trend toward containing or reducing costs through various means, including lowering reimbursement rates, limiting therapeutic class coverage and negotiating reduced payment schedules with service providers for drug products. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, became law in November 2003 and created a broader prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA also contains provisions intended to reduce or eliminate delays in the introduction of generic drug competition at the end of patent or non-patent market exclusivity. The impact of the MMA on drug prices and new drug utilization over the next several years is unknown. The MMA also made adjustments to the physician fee schedule and the measure by which prescription drugs are presently paid, changing from Average Wholesale Price to Average Sales Price. The effects of these changes are unknown but may include decreased utilization of new medicines in physician prescribing patterns, and further pressure on drug company sponsors to provide discount programs and reimbursement support programs. There have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, federal and state proposals to constrain expenditures for medical products and services, which may affect reimbursement levels for our future products. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services frequently change product descriptors, coverage policies, product and service codes, payment methodologies and reimbursement values. Third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates and may have sufficient market power to demand significant price reductions.\nForeign governments tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, prescription drug pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our profitability will be negatively affected.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur research and development activities use biological and hazardous materials that are dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes resulting from these materials. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, state and federal environmental protection agencies and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act. OSHA, state governments or federal Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, may adopt regulations that may affect our research and development programs. We are unable to predict whether any agency will adopt any regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these laws and regulations.\nAlthough we believe our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe stock markets in general, the markets for biotechnology stocks and, in particular, the stock price of our common stock, have experienced extreme volatility. Although we intend to apply to be listed on the NYSE MKT or another major national securities exchange, our stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB market. The market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that trade on a national securities exchange and have large public floats, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than the shares of such larger, more established companies for the indefinite future, even if we are listed on the NYSE MKT or another major national securities exchange. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, our common shares are, compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this limited liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand. Secondly, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to the early stage of our drug development programs and our lack of profits to date, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company that trades on a national securities exchange and has a large public float. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common shares will be at any time, including as to whether our common shares will sustain their current market prices, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common shares for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.\nPrice declines in our common stock could also result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors, including:\n\u00b7 adverse results or delays in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates, clinical trials or the manufacturing processes of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations, patents or new products by our competitors;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u00b7 any lawsuit involving us or our product candidates;\n\u00b7 announcements concerning our competitors, or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries in general;\n\u00b7 developments concerning any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may enter into;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in recommendations by securities analysts or lack of analyst coverage;\n\u00b7 deviations in our operating results from the estimates of analysts;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and five percent stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock; and\n\u00b7 loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, litigation has often been brought against that company. Any such lawsuit could consume resources and management time and attention, which could adversely affect our business.\nYou may incur substantial dilution as a result of the exercise of convertible securities issued in connection with recent financing transactions.\nYou may incur substantial dilution as a result of the exercise or conversion of convertible securities issued in connection with recent financing transactions. Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily through issuances of equity and debt. On June 26, 2013, we completed a private placement of convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock with gross proceeds of approximately $7.0 million through the sale of shares of our newly-created Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. As part of the same transaction, approximately $5.5 million in outstanding convertible notes were converted into shares of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase common stock. On July 15, 2013, we completed a second closing in which we converted approximately $0.8 million of outstanding convertible notes into Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase common stock. The financing was led by life-sciences investors RA Capital Management and Third Security, LLC, with participation from BioScience Managers Pty Ltd.\nUnder the terms of the financing, we issued an aggregate amount of approximately 10.0 million shares of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $13.3 million (including the conversion of approximately $6.3 million of outstanding convertible notes). Each share of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 shares of common stock and accrues dividends at the rate of 10% per year. Additionally, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to approximately 25.0 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.14 per share.\nIn December 2013, we completed a private placement in which we issued 72,007,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a price per share of $0.25, and in connection with the private placement, issued warrants to purchase 4,320,420 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share to the placement agents.\nIn addition, in March 2015, we completed a private placement in which we issued 78,787,880 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a price per share of $0.165 for an aggregate purchase price of $13 million, and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 19,696,971 shares of common stock which will be exercisable at an exercise price of $0.215 per share. We also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,727,273 shares of common stock to placement agents in connection with the March 2015 private placement.\nA significant number of shares of our common stock are subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options, which upon such exercise would result in dilution to our security holders.\nAs of April 3, 2015, we have outstanding warrants to purchase 63,314,696 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $0.19 per share, and outstanding options to purchase 22,034,747 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $0.19 per share. The exercise price and/or the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including certain issuances of securities at a price equal to or less than the then current exercise price, subdivisions and stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers or sales of properties and assets and upon the issuance of certain assets or securities to holders of our common stock, as applicable. Although we cannot determine at this time which of these warrants will ultimately be exercised, it is reasonable to assume that such warrants will be exercised only if the exercise price is below the market price of our common stock. To the extent the warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued that will be eligible for resale in the public market, which will result in dilution to our security holders. The issuance of additional securities could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIf our officers, directors and largest stockholders choose to act together, they may be able to control our management and operations, acting in their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.\nAs of April 10, 2015 our officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 10% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.\nOur (i) current articles of incorporation and bylaws, (ii) our intended certificate of incorporation and bylaws upon reincorporation in Delaware, (iii) Washington law and, (iv) upon reincorporation, Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of (i) Washington law, where we are incorporated, (ii) Delaware law, where we intend to reincorporate, (iii) our current articles of incorporation and bylaws and (iv) our intended certificate of incorporation and bylaws upon our reincorporation in Delaware may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u00b7 providing for a classified board of directors with staggered terms;\n\u00b7 requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to (i) our current articles of incorporation and bylaws and (ii) our intended certificate of incorporation and bylaws upon reincorporation in Delaware;\n\u00b7 eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which, among other things, restricts the ability of shareholders owning ten percent (10%) or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Because we intend to reincorporate in Delaware, we will then be governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nAlthough we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf we do not complete the reverse stock split or reincorporation, we will have a limited number of authorized shares of common stock.\nIf we do not complete a reverse stock split or the reincorporation, or we do not otherwise increase the number of shares we are authorized to issue, we will not have an adequate number of shares for the exercise of the outstanding warrants.\nThe holders of our outstanding warrants may be entitled to cash payments if we do not have adequate authorized shares for the exercise of their warrants. The warrants issued in connection with the March 2015 private placement will be exercisable beginning on the later of (i) the first anniversary of the date of issuance and (ii) the date AmpliPhi effects a reverse stock split or increases the number of authorized shares of common stock, in either case in an amount sufficient to permit the exercise in-full of the warrants issued in this offering. If we effect the reverse stock split or increase the number of shares of authorized common stock before the first anniversary of the issuance of the warrants, the warrants will become exercisable at such time. If we do not effect the reverse stock split or increase the number of authorized shares before the first anniversary, the holders of the warrants will be entitled to an aggregate cash payment of $2,500,000, and such payment could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, if we do not increase the number of authorized shares available for issuance, we may not be able to raise additional capital until we increase the number of shares we are authorized to issue.\nMaintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, if our common stock is listed on an exchange (such as the NYSE MKT), the rules of such exchange. The requirements of these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Exchange Act will require, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently.\nWe currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud.\nIn accordance with NASDAQ or NYSE MKT rules, we will be required to maintain a majority independent board of directors. We also expect that the various rules and regulations applicable to public companies will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent for purposes of NASDAQ or NYSE MKT rules, and officers will be significantly curtailed.\nCompliance with these reporting rules, Sarbanes-Oxley Act and NASDAQ or NYSE MKT requirements may require us to build out our accounting and finance staff. We may need to expand our accounting and financing staff, and our failure to adequately do so would harm our ability to comply with the requirements listed above.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate any deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements, and our stock price may materially decline.\nOur independent registered public accounting firms did not perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2013 in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation was required. Although not required, our management did review our internal controls for the year ended December 31, 2014 and identified material weakness in the area of complex and non-routine transactions as further described in Item 9A of this Form 10-K. If we are unable to successfully remediate any significant deficiency or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, identify any additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that may exist, or satisfy the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, and our stock price may decline materially as a result.\nWe may be unable to list our common stock on the NYSE MKT or another major national securities exchange, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of our common stock.\nTrading in our common stock continues to be conducted on the OTCQB in the over-the-counter market. We intend to apply to be listed on the NYSE MKT or another major national securities exchange. To establish and maintain our listing on the NYSE MKT or another major national securities exchange, we must meet certain requirements with respect to corporate governance, minimum bid price per share, minimum capitalization requirements, and various other matters. If we fail to meet any of the applicable listing standards, we may not qualify for listing on the NYSE MKT or such other major national securities exchange. If our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT or another major national securities exchange, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to meet ongoing listing standards and maintain a listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT or any other major national securities exchange. Until such time as we qualify for listing on the NYSE MKT or another major national securities exchange, our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQB.\nOur inability to be listed on a national securities exchange may limit our opportunities to effectively reach capital markets in the future and may limit our credibility with investors. Those factors could affect our ability to raise capital in the future, which could have a potential deleterious effect on the liquidity and value of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have one security analyst and may never obtain additional research coverage by other securities and industry analysts. If no additional securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. If we obtain additional securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock may cause dilution or depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, we also intend to register all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the lock-up agreements contained in the relevant agreements.\nIf a large number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock are sold in the public market after they become eligible for sale, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\nIn addition, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to continue operations and support our product development activities. Issuances of additional shares or convertible securities may result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nTrading of our stock is restricted by the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations and certain FINRA rules, which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock.\nOur securities are covered by certain \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, among other things. In addition, the penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before effecting a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing before effecting the transaction, and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. These rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers and holders to sell our common stock and may negatively impact the level of trading activity for our common stock. To the extent our common stock remains subject to the penny stock regulations, such regulations may discourage investor interest in and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act. For so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we may lose such status earlier, depending on the occurrence of certain events. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which we refer to as the Exchange Act, which means that the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive or our company less comparable to certain other public companies because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d", "PERMNO": 80577, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARMP"}
