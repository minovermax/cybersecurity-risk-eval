{"cik": "1571498", "company": "Epizyme, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisk Factors\nCareful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the SEC, in evaluating our company and our business. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only risks facing our company. New risk factors can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict the impact that any factor or combination of factors may have on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and in the future may exacerbate or further impact risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise.\nRisks Related to Product Development and Commercialization\nWe are dependent on the successful development and commercialization of tazemetostat. If we do not successfully commercialize TAZVERIK for the indications for which TAZVERIK is approved or are unable to develop, obtain marketing approval of, and commercialize tazemetostat for additional indications, either alone or through a collaboration, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be harmed.\nOur EZH2 inhibitor, TAZVERIK, is approved in the United States for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma, or ES, and for follicular lymphoma, or FL. We have no other products approved for sale. We are investing a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources to fund the development and commercialization of tazemetostat. In January 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection.\nIn June 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK for the following FL indications: (1) adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and (2) adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.\nIn connection with the accelerated approval of our ES new drug application, or NDA and our FL supplemental NDA, or sNDA, continued approval is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory program in each indication. We are conducting Phase 1b/3 trials to assess TAZVERIK in combination with doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin plus placebo as a front-line treatment for ES and to evaluate the combination of TAZVERIK with \u201cR2\u201d (Revlimid plus rituximab), an approved chemotherapy-free treatment regimen, for FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting. These trials are expensive and time-consuming and may not confirm such benefit and subject the NDAs to withdrawal. If a confirmatory program does not verify clinical benefit for an indication, we may have to withdraw our accelerated approval for that indication. If any of these outcomes occurs, either to TAZVERIK or to any future product candidate for which we may seek marketing approval, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for tazemetostat or such future product candidates, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe and our collaborators are conducting clinical trials of tazemetostat in other indications and in combination with other products. All of our other future product candidates are still in preclinical development. As a result, our prospects are substantially dependent on our ability, or the ability of any future collaborator, to successfully commercialize tazemetostat for ES and FL in the approved indications and to develop, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize tazemetostat in one or more additional disease indications.\nThe success of tazemetostat will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nsuccess of the ongoing commercialization of TAZVERIK for ES and FL in the approved indications, whether alone or in combination with other products;\n\u2022\nsuccessful confirmatory trials of TAZVERIK in the approved indications that are satisfactory to the FDA and maintenance of the continued acceptable safety profiles of the products following approval;\n\u2022\ncontinued implementation and maintenance of effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and strategies for commercialization of TAZVERIK;\n\u2022\nacceptance of TAZVERIK for ES, FL, and any other indication for which it may be approved by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community;\n\u2022\ntimely submission of a marketing authorization application to and timely receipt of marketing approval from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for ES, FL or any future indications;\n\u2022\nthe extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nsuccessful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials for the treatment of additional indications;\n\u2022\nsafety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA, the EMA, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval for additional indications and maintenance of continued acceptable safety profile following approval;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining healthcare insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nmaking arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nprotecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022\neffectively and successfully navigating the commercial and operational challenges and impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, including clinical development, the regulatory review process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing and sales efforts of any collaborator. If any of these factors adversely affects the development or commercialization of tazemetostat, we may not be able to successfully develop or commercialize tazemetostat on a timely basis or at all, which would materially harm our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our commercial launch of TAZVERIK in FL and ES, may affect our ability to initiate and complete preclinical studies and our ongoing and planned clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities, further disrupt commercialization of TAZVERIK, or have other adverse effects on our business and operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial disruption in the financial markets and may adversely impact economies worldwide, both of which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 and has spread worldwide, is causing many governments to implement measures to slow the spread of the outbreak through quarantines, travel restrictions, heightened border scrutiny, and other measures. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; unemployment has increased; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. The future progression of the outbreak and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain.\nWe and our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and contract research organizations, or CROs, may face disruptions that may affect our ability to initiate and conduct preclinical studies and our planned and ongoing clinical trials, including disruptions in procuring items that are essential for our research and development activities, such as access to raw materials used in the manufacture of tazemetostat and/or our other future product candidates, laboratory supplies used in our preclinical studies and ongoing clinical trials, or animals that are used for preclinical testing for which there are shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the outbreak. We and our CROs and CMOs, as well as clinical trial sites, may face disruptions related to our ongoing clinical trials, planned clinical trials or future clinical trials arising from manufacturing disruptions, staffing disruptions and limitations on our activities and the activities of our CROs and CMOs, and delays in the ability to obtain necessary institutional review board or other necessary site approvals or delays in site initiations or site monitoring visits, as well as other delays at clinical trial sites. We may also face limitations on enrollment and patients withdrawing from our clinical trials or not complying with the protocol procedures, which could delay completion of our clinical trials or adversely affect the data generated by our clinical trials. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic may redirect resources with respect to regulatory and intellectual property matters in a way that could adversely impact our ability to progress regulatory approvals and protect our intellectual property. In addition, we may face impediments to regulatory meetings and approvals due to measures intended to limit in-person interactions.\nWe commenced commercial sales of TAZVERIK in January 2020, and the pandemic and related government measures have limited our ability to access accounts and healthcare professionals, in person or at all, to provide medical information to promote TAZVERIK. For example, during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively impact ES and FL patient visits to physicians, new patient starts across all lines of treatment as well as the ability of our field-based teams to fully access ES and FL prescribers, and these challenges continued in the first quarter of 2021. The pandemic has significantly impacted economies worldwide, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations. Moreover, the pandemic has also caused substantial disruption in the financial markets and may adversely impact economies worldwide, both of which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations as well as the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock.\nWe continue to operate under a remote operating model for all employees other than certain members of our laboratory and facilities staff, and we continue to evaluate this policy for our offices based on guidance from federal, state and local government authorities. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, this could increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local and federal regulators, ethics committees, manufacturing sites, research or clinical trial sites and other important agencies and contractors, including our CROs and CMOs.\nFor instance, as part of our remote operating model, our laboratory staff engaged in research and development activities continue to have restricted access to laboratories. Accordingly, our laboratory staff are not yet back to their full daily output as existed prior to the onset of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, this could delay timely completion of preclinical activities and initiation of additional clinical trials for other of our development programs.\nDue to the evolving and uncertain global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot precisely determine or quantify the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had or will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 and beyond.\nTazemetostat or any other product candidate that we develop may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nTazemetostat or any other product candidates that we develop may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If tazemetostat or any other such product candidate that we develop does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of tazemetostat or any other product candidates that we develop will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nany safety events that may have occurred in connection with the development of the product candidate; and\n\u2022\nany restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nIn addition, the potential market opportunity for tazemetostat is difficult to precisely estimate. Our estimates of the potential market opportunity for tazemetostat include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, no independent source has verified such assumptions. If any of these assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for tazemetostat could be smaller than our estimates of our potential market opportunity. If the actual market for tazemetostat is smaller than we expect, our product revenue may be limited and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing tazemetostat or any other product candidates that we may develop if and when such product candidate is approved.\nTo achieve commercial success for any product for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need to maintain an effective sales and marketing organization.\nWe have recently established, and plan to continue to build, the infrastructure that we believe is necessary and appropriate to support the ongoing commercialization and marketing of TAZVERIK for the approved indications in the United States and the successful commercial launch and marketing of tazemetostat for other indications and in other jurisdictions and of other future product candidates that may receive marketing approval. There are risks involved with maintaining our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting, training and retaining a sales force is expensive and time consuming and any failure to do so successfully could negatively affect sales or any commercial launch of a product. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. These efforts may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to successfully commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any current or future products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are unable to effectively maintain our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and as a result we determine to enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, could be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may determine to seek to enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services in certain geographies outside the United States or for additional indications. However, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute TAZVERIK or any future product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell, market or distribute our products effectively. If we do not establish and maximize sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing TAZVERIK or any future product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to tazemetostat, and will likely face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of many of the indications for which we are selling TAZVERIK and for which we are developing tazemetostat. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of pharmaceutical products that may compete with our products or product candidates. Tazemetostat and any future product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nIn the relapsed and refractory FL patient setting, both current and near-term competition exists. The most common current treatments for FL are chemotherapies, usually combined with the CD-20 antibodies Rituxan or Gazyva. Multiple PI3K therapies, such as idelalisib (ZYDELIG), copanlisib (ALIQOPA), duvelisib (COPIKTRA), and umbralisib (UKONIQ) are approved for patients with relapsed/refractory FL. These therapies are utilized predominantly in the third line or later treatment. While CD20 and PI3K therapies are approved in FL, there are no therapies that are approved specifically for the treatment of tumors associated with EZH2 activating mutations. There are a number of companies currently evaluating investigational agents in the relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma patient setting including the development of CAR-T therapies and bispecific monoclonal antibodies.\nIn the ES patient setting, there are no therapies approved specifically for epithelioid sarcoma, other than TAZVERIK. Most of the approved therapies utilized in ES are more broadly approved for soft tissue sarcoma in general. Furthermore, the only therapies in late stage clinical trials are being developed for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma as well.\nThere are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Companies that are developing new epigenetic treatments for cancer that target histone methyltransferases, or HMTs, and protein arginine methyltransferases, or PRMTs, include GSK,\nJohnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, and Constellation Pharmaceuticals. Further, companies which are known to have EZH2 inhibitor programs or related programs include: Constellation Pharmaceuticals, developing an EZH2 inhibitor CPI-0209, Phase 1/2, advanced tumors (solid tumors and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL); Novartis AG, developing an EED inhibitor which indirectly blocks EZH2 (MAK683, Phase 1/2, advanced malignancies); Daiichi Sankyo, developing a EZH1/EZH2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat, DS-3201, Phase 1, relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas, AML, ALL as well as Phase 2 for small cell lung cancer and relapsed or refractory adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma); and Pfizer, developing EZH2 inhibitor PF-06821497, Phase 1, relapsed or refractory SCLC, castration-resistant prostate cancer, FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition, many companies are developing cancer therapeutics that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms other than HMTs, including Celgene Corporation (now part of Bristol-Myers Squibb), or Celgene, Merck & Co., Inc., Secura Bio, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, and Otsuka, which are marketing cancer treatments that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms other than HMTs.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than tazemetostat for ES, FL or any indication for which we may develop tazemetostat or any other products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for tazemetostat for any future indication for which we may develop tazemetostat or any other product we may develop, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently on the market for many of the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. We expect that tazemetostat will continue to be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nTazemetostat and any other future product candidate that we commercialize may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch and market acceptance of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize tazemetostat or any other future product candidates that we develop successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health\ninsurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish corresponding reimbursement levels. A significant trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors continue to attempt to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory to recoup our investment. Reimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the intended use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nClinical drug development is a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of tazemetostat and any future product candidates.\nWe are conducting multiple clinical trials of tazemetostat. In addition, under our collaboration with Glaxo Group Limited (an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline plc), or GSK, GSK has initiated a Phase 2 expansion clinical trial for GSK3326595, a PRMT5 inhibitor, and has initiated patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of GSK3368715, a PRMT1 inhibitor. The risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any product candidates that we may develop will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development, manufacture, and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any product candidates in humans.\nProduct candidates are subject to preclinical safety studies, which may be conducted prior to or concurrently with clinical testing, as well as continued clinical safety assessment throughout clinical testing. The outcomes of these safety studies or assessments may delay the launch of or patient enrollment in clinical studies. For example, in the course of our preclinical safety studies of tazemetostat, we observed the development of lymphoma in Sprague-Dawley rats. As a result of these findings, coupled with our limited clinical experience in FL, at the time of the Investigational New Drug Application submission in December 2015, we were unable to conduct our Phase 2 trial of tazemetostat in FL patients in the United States until the beginning of 2017. In addition, in the second quarter of 2018, following a safety report of a pediatric patient who developed a secondary T-cell lymphoma in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of tazemetostat in pediatric patients, the FDA, the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety and Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices each placed a partial clinical hold on new patient enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials of tazemetostat. That partial clinical hold was lifted in September 2018 by the FDA, in November 2018 by Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, and in January 2019 by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety. In pharmaceutical development, many compounds that initially show promise in early-stage testing for treating cancer\nare later found to cause side effects that prevent further development of the compound. If we or our collaborators are unable to fully and adequately address matters such as these when they arise, we may be unable to conduct clinical trials of tazemetostat or any future product candidates, our trials may be limited to certain patient populations or our ability to conduct other trials in the United States or in other countries may be delayed.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize tazemetostat or any future product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\npreclinical testing may produce results based on which we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical studies before we proceed with certain clinical trials, limit the scope of our clinical trials, halt ongoing clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe may have to limit the scope of, suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials.\nWe and our CROs and CMOs, as well as clinical trial sites, may face disruptions related to our ongoing clinical trials, planned clinical trials or future clinical trials arising from manufacturing disruptions, staffing disruptions and limitations on our activities and the activities of our CROs and CMOs, and delays in the ability to obtain necessary institutional review board or other necessary site approvals, as well as other delays at clinical trial sites. We may also face limitations on enrollment and patients withdrawing from our clinical trials or not complying with the protocols, which could delay completion of our clinical trials or adversely affect the data generated by our clinical trials. The impact of these disruptions on our clinical development activities and plans is uncertain and may depend on the length of the disruptions.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of tazemetostat or any future product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of tazemetostat or any future product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling or a risk evaluation mitigation strategy that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs may also increase if we experience delays in clinical testing or in obtaining marketing approvals such as the delays caused by the partial clinical holds in the United States, France and Germany. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will continue or begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for tazemetostat or any future product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. In particular, if our product candidates are focused on specific patient populations, our ability to enroll eligible patients may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than we anticipate. For instance, our ongoing clinical trials of tazemetostat in adult and pediatric patients with INI1-negative tumors are targeting rare patient populations. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials, and may in the future initiate new clinical trials, for product candidates being developed for the same or similar diseases or indications as tazemetostat or any future product candidates or that may treat the broader patient populations within which tazemetostat or any future product candidates are being or may be developed for the treatment of a subset of identifiable patients with cancer and other diseases, which could adversely affect enrollment in our trials, particularly in trials for rare disease indications, as patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, patient recruitment and enrollment in our clinical trials may be adversely affected, delayed or interrupted. Patients may choose to withdraw from our studies or we may choose to or be required to pause enrollment and or patient dosing in our ongoing clinical trials in order to preserve health resources and protect trial participants. It is unknown how long these pauses or disruptions could continue.\nPatient enrollment may be affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe rarity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under trial;\n\u2022\nthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022\nthe potential costs to be incurred by prospective patients in order to participate, such as travel, missed work, and/or childcare;\n\u2022\nthe lack of scientific interest in the study;\n\u2022\nthe ability to identify specific patient populations for molecularly defined study cohorts.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for tazemetostat or any future product candidates and could delay or prevent our ability to obtain marketing approval, which may cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nOur research and development is focused on the creation of novel epigenetic therapies for patients with cancer and other diseases, which is a rapidly evolving area of science, and the approach we are taking to discover and develop drugs is novel.\nThe discovery of novel epigenetic therapies for patients with cancer and other serious diseases is an emerging field, and the scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop tazemetostat and any future product candidates are relatively new. Although epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays an essential role in biological function, few drugs premised on epigenetics have been discovered. Moreover, those drugs based on an epigenetic mechanism that have received marketing approval, other than TAZVERIK, are in different target classes than the chromatin modifying protein, or CMP, inhibitors where our research and development is principally focused. Although preclinical studies suggest that genetic alterations can result in changes to the activity of CMPs making them oncogenic, and although the FDA has granted accelerated approval for TAZVERIK in ES and FL with continued approval contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial for each of the ES and FL indications, to date no company has translated broad biological observations regarding CMP inhibitors into systematic drug discovery. We believe that our first four inhibitors of HMTs in clinical trials are all the first molecules against these targets to enter clinical development. Therefore, we do not know if our approach of inhibiting HMTs or other CMPs to treat patients with cancer and other serious diseases will be successful.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on tazemetostat and any future product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and on tazemetostat and any future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for tazemetostat or a particular future product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nIf we are required to develop a companion or complementary diagnostic and if we or our collaborators are unable to successfully develop diagnostics for tazemetostat or any future therapeutic product candidates when needed, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not achieve marketing approval or realize the full commercial potential of our therapeutic product candidates.\nWe may develop, or we may work with collaborators, to develop diagnostics for tazemetostat or any future therapeutic product candidates to identify patients for our clinical trials who have the specific cancers that we are seeking to treat as appropriate and when existing, available technology may not be sufficient to identify those patients. We do not have experience or capabilities in developing or commercializing diagnostics and plan to rely in\nlarge part on third parties to perform these functions. For example, we have entered into an agreement with Roche Sequencing Solutions, or Roche Sequencing, to develop and commercialize a diagnostic for use with tazemetostat for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, patients with EZH2 activating mutations. Companion or complementary diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. If any third parties that we engage to assist us are unable to successfully develop companion or complementary diagnostics that are needed for our therapeutic product candidates, or experience delays in doing so:\n\u2022\nthe development of our therapeutic product candidates may be adversely affected if we are unable to appropriately select patients for enrollment in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour therapeutic product candidates may not receive marketing approval if their safe and effective use depends on a companion or complementary diagnostic; and\n\u2022\nwe may not realize the full commercial potential of any therapeutic product candidates that receive marketing approval if, among other reasons, we are unable to appropriately identify patients with the specific genetic alterations targeted by our therapeutic product candidates.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our business would be harmed, possibly materially.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our proprietary drug discovery platform to build a pipeline of product candidates.\nA key element of our strategy is to utilize our drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and pursue additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs for the treatment of a variety of different types of cancer and other diseases. We may not be able to develop product candidates that are safe and effective CMP inhibitors. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our technological approach, we will not be able to obtain product revenues in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing and utilization of tazemetostat in connection with the clinical testing and commercial use of tazemetostat and with respect to any other product candidates that we develop or commercialize. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend any related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $30.0 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $30.0 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We will need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and as we continue to commercialize TAZVERIK, or any other product candidate that we develop. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nEnhanced governmental and private scrutiny over, or investigations or litigation involving, pharmaceutical manufacturer donations to patient assistance programs offered by charitable foundations may require us to modify our patient support programs and could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management and increase our expenses.\nTo help patients afford tazemetostat, we have implemented a patient assistance program. These types of programs, designed to assist patients in affording pharmaceuticals, have become the subject of scrutiny. In recent years, some pharmaceutical manufacturers were named in class action lawsuits challenging the legality of components of their patient assistance programs and their support of independent charitable foundations in connection with such programs under a variety of federal and state laws. Our patient assistance program could become the target of similar litigation. In addition, certain state and federal enforcement authorities and members of Congress have initiated inquiries about co-pay assistance programs. Some state legislatures have also been considering proposals that would restrict or ban co-pay coupons.\nFurther, numerous organizations, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, have received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and other enforcement authorities seeking information related to their patient assistance programs and support, and certain of these organizations have entered into, or have otherwise agreed to, significant civil settlements with applicable enforcement authorities. In connection with these civil settlements, the U.S. government has and may in the future require the affected companies to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements that impose significant reporting and other requirements on those companies. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will be sufficient to protect against acts of our employees, business partners or vendors that may potentially violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Regardless of whether we have complied with the law, a government investigation could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management and increase our expenses.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $231.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $170.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $123.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $988.7 million. To date, we have generated only limited revenue from sales of TAZVERIK and have not obtained marketing approval of any other product. We have financed our operations primarily through our collaborations, our public offerings, private placements of our common and preferred stock, our loan facility with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit PLC, and other funding transactions. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including clinical and preclinical studies, seeking marketing approval for product candidates and building our commercial organization with respect to TAZVERIK in the indications for which we have received accelerated approval from the FDA. We are continuing to develop tazemetostat for additional indications and to seek to discover and develop other product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses if and as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue to establish and maintain our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to support the ongoing commercial launch of TAZVERIK and the commercial launch of any other product candidate that is approved;\n\u2022\ngrow our medical affairs organization to provide medical support for tazemetostat and any other product candidate that is approved;\n\u2022\nconduct our Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trials in ES and FL;\n\u2022\ndesign and conduct new and ongoing monotherapy and combination trials of tazemetostat in FL;\n\u2022\nconduct clinical trials or support investigator-sponsored trials to evaluate tazemetostat as a monotherapy or in combinations in additional indications;\n\u2022\npay any milestone payments provided for and achieved under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai Co Ltd, or Eisai;\n\u2022\npay interest and principal associated with our amended and restated loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit PLC, or the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement;\n\u2022\ncontinue the research and development of our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek to discover and develop additional product candidates or to expand our product candidates into additional lines of treatment;\n\u2022\nprepare NDA submissions as we seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nhire additional clinical, quality control, manufacturing and scientific personnel; and\n\u2022\nadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must generate significant revenue. The ability to generate this revenue requires us to successfully commercialize TAZVERIK in ES and FL and in additional indications for which we may develop and obtain approval for tazemetostat, which requires us to be effective in a range of challenging activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution. In addition, we expect our expenses to increase as we fund our tazemetostat development program; make any milestone and royalty payments provided for and achieved under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai; pay interest and principal associated with the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement; and continue research and development and initiate clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, any future product candidates. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nBased on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020, together with the cash we expect to generate from product sales, will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements and pay our debt service obligations as they become due into 2023, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments we may receive under our collaboration agreements. We have based these expectations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, such as the\nrevenue that we expect to generate from the sale of our products, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following, as well as the uncertain impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these factors:\n\u2022\nthe costs of commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution and patient support programs for tazemetostat or any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nrevenue received from commercial sales of TAZVERIK;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of tazemetostat;\n\u2022\nthe number and development requirements of additional indications for tazemetostat and other product candidates that we determine to pursue, including the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery research, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for such product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of tazemetostat and other product candidates we may pursue;\n\u2022\nroyalties payable by us on sales of TAZVERIK under our amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai;\n\u2022\nmilestones, option exercise fees, license fees, and other revenues, if any, we may receive under collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nthe revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, defending any intellectual property-related claims, and challenging the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies; and\n\u2022\ninterest and principal payments under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and even if regulatory approval is obtained, we may never achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we may need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and license and development agreements with collaboration partners. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Additional debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our existing indebtedness and the pledge of our assets as collateral limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur indebtedness resulting from our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations.\nIn November 2019, we entered into the Loan Agreement with BioPharma Credit PLC, or the Collateral Agent, and BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP and BPCR Limited Partnership (as transferee of BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP\u2019s interest as a lender), or the Lenders, providing for up to $70.0 million in secured term loans to be advanced in up to three tranches, or the Loan Agreement, of which $25.0 million was drawn by us in November 2019, $25.0 million was drawn by us in March 2020, and $20.0 million was drawn by us in June 2020. The maturity date of the first three tranches is November 18, 2024, unless terminated earlier.\nIn November 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, amending and restating the Loan Agreement to provide for, among other things, an additional secured term loan facility of $150.0 million, or the Tranche D Loan. In November 2020, we drew the $150.0 million Tranche D Loan. The maturity date of the Tranche D Loan is November 18, 2026, unless terminated earlier. Under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement we have the right to request from the Lenders, subject to the Lenders\u2019 agreement to lend additional amounts to us, up to an additional $150.0 million, provided that we have not prepaid any outstanding term loans at the time of our request and such request is made before November 18, 2021.\nSubject to customary exceptions and exclusions, all obligations under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement are secured pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, a guaranty and security agreement between us, certain of our subsidiaries, and the Collateral Agent, or the Pledge Agreement, and intellectual property and security agreements between us and Collateral Agent, or the IP Security Agreements. Under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, the Pledge Agreement, and the IP Security Agreements, we provided to the Lenders a perfected, first-priority security interest in all of our personal property and a perfected, first-priority security interest in substantially all of our intellectual property related to tazemetostat.\nA failure to comply with the conditions of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement could result in an event of default. An event of default under the term loan facility includes, among other things, a failure to pay any amount due under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement as well as the occurrence of events that could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement as a result of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay the term loans or to make any accelerated payments.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nOur existing therapeutic collaborations are important to our business, and future collaborations may also be important to us. If we are unable to maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur resources for drug development are limited and we continue to build our sales, marketing, medical affairs and supply chain infrastructure. Accordingly, we have entered into therapeutic collaborations with other companies that we believe can contribute to our ability to rapidly develop and commercialize TAZVERIK and any product candidates we may identify and develop, including our collaboration and license agreement with GSK. Our collaborations have provided us with important funding for our development programs and product platform and we expect to receive additional funding under these collaborations in the future. Our existing therapeutic collaborations, and any future collaborations we enter into, may pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not have the ability or the development capabilities to perform their obligations as expected, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our collaborators\u2019 operations or business;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that may divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, not initiate or delay initiation of clinical trials, pause or stop enrollment in a clinical trial, terminate an ongoing clinical trial, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products and product candidates if the collaborators believe that the competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\nproduct candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\na collaborator may fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the development, manufacture, distribution or marketing of a product candidate or product;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or terminations of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator, and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nIf our therapeutic collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its collaboration with us, we may not receive the funding under the collaboration that we anticipated. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of our product platform and product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop product candidates and our product platform. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also apply to the activities of our therapeutic collaborators.\nOur existing therapeutic collaborations contain restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that are the subject of the collaboration with third parties for specified periods of time. These restrictions may have the effect of preventing us from undertaking development and other efforts that may appear to be attractive to us.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Celgene and Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH each terminated their collaborations with us without cause.\nFor some of our product candidates or for some CMP targets, we may in the future collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of therapeutic products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a\ncollaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities for the product candidate or program on our own or at our own expense or curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure of our third-party collaborators to successfully commercialize diagnostics, developed for use with our therapeutic product candidates, if and when needed, could harm our ability to commercialize these product candidates.\nWe do not plan to develop diagnostics internally and, as a result, if diagnostics are needed, we will be dependent on the efforts of our third-party collaborators to successfully commercialize diagnostics when existing, available technology may not be sufficient to identify patients for treatment with our therapeutic product candidates. For example, Roche Sequencing has developed a companion or complementary diagnostic for detecting activating mutations in EZH2 in the tazemetostat NHL program. Our collaborators:\n\u2022\nmay not perform their obligations as expected or have difficulty responding to accelerated approval timelines alongside the therapeutic product development;\n\u2022\nmay encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the diagnostics;\n\u2022\nmay encounter delays or have difficulty obtaining regulatory approval for the diagnostic in target markets;\n\u2022\nmay have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the diagnostics in the clinical community;\n\u2022\nmay not pursue commercialization of any diagnostics that achieve regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nmay elect not to continue or renew commercialization programs based on changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022\nmay not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products; and\n\u2022\nmay terminate their relationship with us.\nIf required diagnostics for use with our therapeutic product candidates fail to gain market acceptance, our ability to derive revenues from sales of our therapeutic product candidates could be harmed. If our collaborators fail to commercialize these diagnostics, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with our therapeutic product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and delay the development or commercialization of our therapeutic product candidates.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe currently rely on third-party clinical research organizations to conduct our ongoing clinical trials. We do not plan to independently conduct clinical trials of tazemetostat or any future product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as clinical research organizations, research collaborative groups, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our clinical trials. These agreements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our product development activities might be delayed.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants or patients are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe also expect to continue to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supply for our clinical trials and our commercial operations. Any performance failure on the part of any such distributor could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of tazemetostat for commercialization and clinical testing, and expect to contract with third parties for the manufacture of any other product candidates that we develop for preclinical and clinical testing and for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities and rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of tazemetostat and any other product candidates we develop that receive marketing approval. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of tazemetostat or any other product candidate or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on such third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third-party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\nTazemetostat and any other product candidate that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development, or marketing approval, and could adversely impact our ability to sell our approved products. We have already built additional redundancy in our supply chain and have plans to continue to qualify additional raw material manufacturers in our TAZVERIK supply chain. If our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. We expect that we would incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our technology, products and product candidates or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology, products or product candidates similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our technology, products or product candidates may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection in the United States and foreign jurisdictions with respect to our proprietary technology, products and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technology, products and product candidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute or maintain all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we may fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these in-licensed patents and applications may not be prepared, filed, prosecuted or maintained in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nAlthough we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who may have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby potentially jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the scope of our patent protection outside of the United States is uncertain, and laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. With respect to our patent rights, we cannot predict whether the patent applications we and/or our licensors are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases at all. Therefore, neither we nor our licensors can know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in the patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology, products or product candidates, in\nwhole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from developing or commercializing competitive technologies, products and product candidates. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may diminish the value of our patent rights or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. For example, we are involved in an opposition proceeding against one of our European patents, the claims of which cover a method for determining whether a cancer patient is a candidate for treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor based on their EZH2 mutation status. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize our technology or products without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our owned and/or in-licensed patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize our technology, products or product candidates. Furthermore, such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and divert the time and attention of our management and employees, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.\nIn addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope may be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if our owned and/or in-licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and/or in-licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and divert the time and attention of our management and employees, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned and/or in-licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. As a result, our owned and/or in-licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing technology and/or products similar or identical to any of our technology and products.\nMoreover, some of our owned and/or in-licensed patents and patent applications are, and may in the future be, co-owned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners\u2019 interest in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing technology and products. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co-owner of our patents in order to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension for our products, our business may be materially harmed.\nIn the United States, depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of a product candidate, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved product may be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent for those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing such product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We have applied for patent term extension on a patent that covers the TAZVERIK drug substance based on the regulatory review of TAZVERIK for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. In the future, if and when any additional product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents\ncovering those approved products. Similarly, in foreign jurisdictions where we have obtained regulatory approval, we intend to seek patent term extensions for any applicable issued patent rights if such extensions are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of any such extensions. We may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of the relevant patent(s), or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. If we are unable to obtain any patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following the expiration of our patent rights, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and commercial prospects could be materially harmed.\nChanges to patent laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions could significantly diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our technology, products and product candidates.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of patent laws in the United States by the United States Congress, the federal courts, or the USPTO, including patent reform legislation such as the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, or similar changes in other jurisdictions whether by governments, courts or regulators, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patent rights. For example, the Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents, and enable third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent at USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review and derivation proceedings. Assuming that other statutory requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. Accordingly, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of patent laws in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions and their implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned and/or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patent rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our patent or other intellectual property rights. As a result, we may need to file infringement, misappropriation or other intellectual property claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. Such parties could also counterclaim that the patent rights we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Moreover, third parties may institute such claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, and within or outside of the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings).\nAn adverse result in any such proceeding could put one or more of our patent rights at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and could put one or more of our owned and/or in-licensed patent applications at risk of being found unpatentable. Any of the foregoing could limit our ability to limit our competitors\u2019 ability to develop and commercialize competing technologies and products and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our technology or product candidates or commercialization of our technology or products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to develop our technology or product candidates or commercialize our technology or products, in which case we may be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or may only be available on a non-exclusive basis, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our current and future products and use our proprietary technology without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or administrative proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology, products and product candidates, including interference proceedings, post grant review, inter partes review and derivation proceedings before the USPTO and similar proceedings in foreign jurisdictions such as oppositions before the European Patent Office.\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of merit. For example, with respect to tazemetostat, we are aware of a U.S. patent held by a third party, which could be construed to cover the use of tazemetostat in certain clinical indications. We have preemptively requested inter partes review at the USPTO challenging the validity of that patent. In the event that an owner of this patent were to bring an infringement action against us, we believe we have defenses that we could assert in such event, and additionally in the USPTO, including the invalidity of the relevant claims of such patents. However, we may not be successful in asserting these defenses, including proving invalidity, and could be found to infringe this third-party patent.\nWe may not be aware of all intellectual property rights potentially relating to our technology, products and product candidates and their potential uses. Thus, we do not know with certainty that our technology, products and product candidates or our development and commercialization thereof, do not and will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nEven if we believe that third party intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court or other judicial or regulatory body would find in our favor on questions of misappropriation, infringement, validity, enforceability or priority. A court of competent jurisdiction or other applicable regulatory body could disregard any claims that we make and hold that third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our technology, products and product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us and could require us to make substantial licensing and/or royalty payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing and/or commercializing the infringing technology, product candidates or products. In addition, we could be found liable for significant monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right and could be forced to indemnify our customers or collaborators. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our technology, product candidates or products and/or could force us to cease\nsome of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Additionally, we could be forced to redesign our products or product candidates, seek new regulatory approvals or indemnify third parties pursuant to contractual agreements. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance, renewal and annuity fees and various other governmental fees on any issued patent and pending patent application must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages or annually over the lifetime of our owned and/or in-licensed patents and patent applications. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In certain circumstances, we rely on our licensing partners to pay these fees to, or comply with the procedural and documentary rules of, the relevant patent agency. With respect to our patent rights, we employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and we rely on an annuity service to remind us of the due dates and to make payment after we instruct them to do so. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, however the ability to cure may not be possible in some cases or may be subject to certain deadlines or other restrictions that may not be practicable to satisfy. While to date we have not experienced any material abandonment, lapse or loss of patent rights that was not able to be cured, there could be situations in which non-compliance could result in material abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our technology, products or product candidates, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical technology, products or product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to license and research agreements that impose, and we may enter into additional licensing and funding arrangements with third parties that may impose, on us diligence, development and commercialization timelines, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations. Under our existing licensing and funding agreements, we are obligated to pay royalties on net product sales of products or related technologies to the extent they are covered by the agreements. If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future license and funding agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture or commercialize any product that is covered by these agreements or may face other penalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the value of the products or product candidates being developed under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, consultants, contractors or we have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting that we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, consultants and contractors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees, consultants and contractors or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops or has developed intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and prospects. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to develop and/or commercialize our technology, product candidates, and/or products, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or such license may be non-exclusive. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nIntellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and may also have an advantage in such proceedings due to their more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent or other intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology, products and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nThe marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize tazemetostat for other indications or any other of our product candidates that we develop, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product and product candidates, including tazemetostat, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, export and import are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the EMA and similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval for tazemetostat for any potential indication or of any other product candidate will prevent us from commercializing tazemetostat for that indication or the product candidate. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and rely on third-party clinical research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety, efficacy and quality. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates for which we seek approval may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. New cancer drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations that have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies, or additional manufacturing data. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate on an accelerated basis or at all. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nWe received accelerated approval of TAZVERIK in patients with ES and in patients with relapsed or refractory FL. In order to obtain accelerated approval for future indications in tazemetostat or any other product candidate, we must demonstrate that our product candidate provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. In addition, as a condition of accelerated approval of TAZVERIK in ES and FL, continued approval for these indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in post-marketing confirmatory trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, and if the studies are unsuccessful for a given indication, TAZVERIK in ES or FL may be subject to withdrawal procedures.\nAdditionally, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies may have slower response times or be under-resourced to continue to monitor our future applications for accelerated approval or our ongoing clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a result, review, inspection, and other timelines may be materially delayed. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of our product candidates.\nWe may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates and, even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA or the EMA from approving other competing products.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States.\nWe have obtained orphan drug designations in the United States for tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with FL, chordoma, malignant rhabdoid tumors, or MRT, soft tissue sarcoma, or STS, and mesothelioma. The orphan drug designation for the treatment of MRT applies to INI1-negative MRT as well as SMARCA4-negative malignant rhabdoid tumor of ovary, or MRTO. We have also obtained orphan drug designations for tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with FL, DLBCL and malignant mesothelioma in Europe. We may not receive orphan drug designation for tazemetostat for other indications, or for any other future clinical candidates we may develop.\nWe have also obtained marketing exclusivity designations for tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with ES and FL. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The exclusivity period in Europe can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. In addition, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOn August 18, 2017, Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA. FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA\u2019s pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, FDARA amended section 505B \u201cResearch into pediatric uses for drugs and biological products\u201d of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. Section 355c). Previously, drugs that had been granted orphan drug designation were exempt from the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Under the amended section 505B, beginning on August 18, 2020, the submission of a pediatric assessment, waiver or deferral will be required for certain molecularly targeted cancer indications with the submission of an NDA application or supplement to an NDA application. Under FDARA, products with orphan drug designation that fall under this category will no longer be exempt from the pediatric research requirement. In December 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance interpreting and implementing these provisions. FL qualifies for an automatic full pediatric waiver by the FDA because it rarely or never occurs in pediatric patients. However, our other indications in development or future product candidates may require a pediatric assessment, which could result in delays in obtaining orphan drug exclusivity and increased costs and delays in obtaining regulatory approval.\nWe may seek certain designations for our product candidates, including Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy, designations, but we might not receive such designations, and even if we do, such designations may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek certain designations for one or more of our product candidates that could expedite review and approval by the FDA. For example, if a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation. Drugs that have received Fast Track designation from the FDA are eligible for expedited development and priority review, and the opportunity for a rolling review, under certain circumstances.\nA breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval.\nWe have received Fast Track designation from the FDA for tazemetostat for patients with relapsed or refractory FL, relapsed or refractory DLBCL with EZH2 activating mutations, and metastatic or locally advanced ES who have progressed on or following an anthracycline-based treatment regimen. We intend to seek Fast Track designation for tazemetostat for other indications and for our other product candidates as appropriate. Our submissions for marketing approval of tazemetostat in ES and FL received expedited development and priority review. We may also seek breakthrough therapy designation for tazemetostat or any future product candidate we may develop.\nThe FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant such designations, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for the designation, we cannot assure that the FDA would decide to grant it. Moreover, even if we do receive Fast Track or breakthrough therapy designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. We or the FDA may withdraw these designations if either party believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in those jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell TAZVERIK or any other product candidate that we may develop in the European Union, or EU, and many other foreign jurisdictions, we or our third-party collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside of the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, a product must be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or our third-party collaborators may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside of the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside of the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nAdditionally, we could face heightened risks with respect to seeking marketing approval in the United Kingdom as a result of the recent withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom . Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom or the European Union for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nIf we are required by the FDA to obtain approval of a companion or complementary diagnostic in connection with approval of a candidate therapeutic product, and there are delays in obtaining FDA approval of a diagnostic device, we will not be able to commercialize the product candidate and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nAccording to FDA guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion or complementary diagnostic is not also approved or cleared for that indication. This is not the case for complementary diagnostics, which are not prerequisites for administration of a drug product. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, companion or complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices, and the FDA has generally required companion or complementary diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain Premarket Approval, or a PMA, for the diagnostic. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical, preclinical, and manufacturing data, and the submission to and review by the FDA, involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device\u2019s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. A PMA is not guaranteed and may take considerable time, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a \u201cnot approvable\u201d determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. As a result, if we are required by the FDA to obtain approval of a companion diagnostic for a candidate therapeutic product, and we do not obtain or there are delays in obtaining FDA approval of a diagnostic device, we may not be able to commercialize the product candidate on a timely basis or at all and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nTazemetostat is, and any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be, subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nTazemetostat and any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to perform post-marketing confirmatory studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. The accelerated approval for tazemetostat subjects us to these conditions. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. New cancer drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations that have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed. If tazemetostat or any other product candidate that we may develop receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug in this way, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product for any approved indication. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure they are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use, and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\ndamage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u2022\nunfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or\n\u2022\nlitigation involving patients using our products.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our clinical trials in the EU. Non-compliance with EU and UK requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties.\nEnacted legislation and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, a sweeping law which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to tazemetostat and to our potential product candidates are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nrequirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u2022\na requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u2022\na Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nFurther, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 became law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. The CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation.\nSince enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d The Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the PPACA during future Congressional session.\nFurther, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is unconstitutional and it remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the severability question and additional analysis of the provisions of the PPACA. Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. Oral argument in the case took place on November 10, 2020, and a ruling by the Court is expected sometime this year. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nThe Trump administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden issued a new executive order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans\u2019 access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.\nWe expect that these healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, and such actions could have a material impact on our business.\nCurrent and future legislative efforts may limit the prices for our products, if and when they are licensed for marketing, and that could materially impact our ability to generate revenues.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. To those ends, President Trump issued five executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products. Several of these orders are reflected in recently promulgated regulations, and one of these regulations is currently subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction. It remains to be seen whether these orders and resulting regulations will remain in force during the Biden Administration. Further, on September 24, 2020, the Trump administration finalized a rulemaking allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers. The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, group purchasing organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nFinally, outside the United States, in some nations, including those of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. In the future, we plan to submit tazemetostat for approval in the EU and, if tazemetostat is approved, it would be subject to these processes. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a\nclinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable could be impaired, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of TAZVERIK and will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any future product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of a federal healthcare covered business, the statue has been violated. In addition, the PPACA, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, currently set at a minimum of $11,665 and a maximum of $23,331 per false claim;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.\nThe provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and, in the UK, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.\nPayments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nIn order to comply with these laws, we have implemented a compliance program to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and by promoting a culture of compliance. Although we take our obligation to maintain our compliance with these various laws and regulations seriously and our compliance program is designed to prevent the violation of these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that our compliance program will be sufficient or effective, that we will be able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our compliance program on a timely basis, that our employees will comply with our policies and that our employees will notify us of any violation of our policies, that we will have the ability to take appropriate and timely corrective action in response to any such violation, or that we will make decisions and take actions that will necessarily limit or avoid liability for whistleblower claims that individuals, such as employees or former employees, may bring against us or that governmental authorities may prosecute against us based on information provided by individuals. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or other applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, imprisonment, diminished profits and future earnings, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws is costly and time-consuming for our management.\nCompliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing, transfer and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy frameworks with which we must comply. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect across all member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA, in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States.\nAs a result, there is increased scrutiny on the extent to which clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply the GPDR to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used personal information and/or impose substantial fines for violations of the GDPR, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR provides that European Union member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data.\nSimilar actions are either in place or under way in the United States. There are a broad variety of data protection laws that are applicable to our activities, and a wide range of enforcement agencies at both the state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy and data security concerns based on general consumer protection laws. The Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General all are aggressive in reviewing privacy and data security protections for consumers. New laws also are being considered at both the state and federal levels. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act-which went into effect on January 1, 2020-is creating similar risks and obligations as those created by GDPR, though the Act does exempt certain information collected as part of a clinical trial subject to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the Common Rule). Many other states are considering similar legislation. A broad range of legislative measures also have been introduced at the federal level. Accordingly, failure to comply with federal and state laws (both those currently in effect and future legislation) regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties under such laws. There also is the threat of consumer class actions related to these laws and the overall protection of personal data. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nGiven the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing for and complying with such requirements is rigorous and time intensive and requires significant resources and a review of our technologies, systems and practices, as well as those of any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants that process or transfer personal data collected in the European Union. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information from our clinical trials, could require us to change our business practices and put in place additional compliance mechanisms, may interrupt or delay our development, regulatory and commercialization activities and increase our cost of doing business, and could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and significant fines and penalties against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, third-party intermediaries, joint venture partners and collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. In addition, we may engage third party intermediaries to coordinate our clinical research activities abroad and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities.\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that mandates compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws applicable to our business throughout the world. We cannot ensure, however, that our employees and third party intermediaries will comply with this code or such anti-corruption laws. Noncompliance with anti-\ncorruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas, investigations, or other enforcement actions are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any such action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management's attention and resources and significant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even cause us to appoint an independent compliance monitor which can result in added costs and administrative burdens.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur internal information systems, or those of any collaborators, contractors, consultants, vendors, business partners or other third parties, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nWe collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including personal information and information relating to intellectual property, on internal information systems and through the information systems of our collaborators, contractors, consultants, vendors, business partners or other third parties.\nDespite the ongoing implementation of security measures, our internal information systems and those of third parties are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such systems are also vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, our collaborators, contractors, consultants, vendors, business partners and other third parties, or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties over the Internet or through other mechanisms. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cyberattacks also could include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient. Our employees and systems have been and likely will continue to be targeted by such cyberattacks.\nWhile we have not experienced any material system failure, accident, cyber-attack or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs, clinical trials and business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from clinical trials could result in delays or termination of our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, as risks with respect to our information systems continue to evolve, we will incur additional costs to maintain the security of our information systems and comply with evolving laws and regulations pertaining to cybersecurity and related areas. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, including regulatory fines and other losses with respect to privacy claims, enrollment in our clinical trials could be negatively affected, our competitive position and reputation could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred by these incidents, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, our cybersecurity insurance.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical and business expertise of our executive officers as well as the other principal members of our management, scientific and clinical teams. Although we have entered into employment letter agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. For instance, since January 1, 2017, we have had multiple executive officers, including among others our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, our former Chief Business Officer, our former President of Research and Chief Scientific Officer, and our former Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer terminate their employment with us. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory, and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions for similar personnel. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience continued growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs and, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents, under Delaware law and in our collaboration agreements could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our collaboration agreements may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares without depressing the market price for the shares or sell their shares at all. Any inactive trading market for our common stock may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund our operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may in the future be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. From January 1, 2018 until February 18, 2021, the sale price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from a high of $27.82 to a low of $5.14. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of TAZVERIK;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments with respect to tazemetostat;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to any of our products, product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the financial markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this Risk Factors section.\nWe have broad discretion over the use of our cash and cash equivalents and may not use them effectively.\nSubject to certain restrictions in our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement documents or in other third-party agreements we may enter into from time to time, our management has broad discretion to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline, delay the development of our product candidates, or adversely impact the success of our commercialization efforts with respect to TAZVERIK. Pending their use to fund operations, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nChanges in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRecent changes in tax law may adversely affect our business or financial condition. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, which significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The TCJA, among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, the limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income (except\nfor certain small businesses), the limitation of the deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks for losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely), the imposition of a one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, the elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), the allowance of immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nAs part of Congress\u2019 response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, or FFCR Act, was enacted on March 18, 2020, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was enacted on March 27, 2020. Both contain numerous tax provisions. In particular, the CARES Act retroactively and temporarily (for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021) suspends application of the 80%-of-income limitation on the use of net operating losses, which was enacted as part of the TCJA. It also provides that net operating losses arising in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021 are generally eligible to be carried back up to five years. The CARES Act also temporarily (for taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020) relaxes the limitation of the tax deductibility for net interest expense by increasing the limitation from 30 to 50% of adjusted taxable income.\nRegulatory guidance under the TCJA, the FFCR Act and the CARES Act is and continues to be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen impact of these laws on our business and financial condition. It is also likely that Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which could have an impact on our company. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA, the FFCR Act or the CARES Act.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nWe cannot predict or estimate the amount of costs we may incur to continue to operate as a public company, nor can we predict the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we have and will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we or our auditors identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. The terms of our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement restrict our ability to pay dividends. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be impacted, in part, by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us, continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price may decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nThere is no public market for our series A convertible preferred stock.\nThere is no established public trading market for our series A convertible preferred stock, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply for listing of the series A convertible preferred stock on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active market, the liquidity of the series A convertible preferred stock will be limited.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur employees, independent contractors, CROs, consultants, commercial partners, vendors and principal investigators may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, independent contractors, CROs, consultants, commercial partners, vendors and, pertaining to clinical trials, our principal investigators. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in the European Union and other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA, the European Commission and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements.\nSuch misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.", "PERMNO": 13924, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EPZM"}
