{"cik": "1439199", "company": "CTPARTNERS EXECUTIVE SEARCH INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and results of operations. As a result of the risk set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and the risk discussed in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur inability to attract and retain qualified executive search consultants would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive search consultants who possess the skills and experience necessary to fulfill our clients\u2019 needs. Our ability to hire and retain qualified executive search consultants could be impaired by any diminution of our reputation, decrease in compensation levels relative to our competitors, modifications of our compensation philosophy or competitor hiring programs. If we cannot attract, hire and retain qualified executive search consultants, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain our professional reputation and brand name our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our overall professional reputation and brand name recognition to secure new engagements and hire qualified executive search consultants. In 2007, we changed our brand from Christian & Timbers to CTPartners. While we believe we have established our brand in the market, a number of our competitors have more established and better name recognition than us. Our success also depends on the individual reputations of our executive search consultants and senior management. We obtain many of our new engagements from existing clients or from referrals by those clients. A client who is dissatisfied with our work can adversely affect our ability to secure new engagements. If our reputation is negatively affected because of poor performance, our brand awareness does not continue to increase or as a result of unfavorable publicity, which we have experienced in recent months, we may experience difficulties in competing successfully for both new engagements and qualified executive search consultants, or retaining our consultants. Failure to maintain our professional reputation and brand name could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional funding if a need arises\nWe believe we can fund our existing operations through cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our credit facility and note purchase agreement. However, if we incur greater than expected expenses, are subject to additional legal proceedings, encounter difficulties retaining consultants or customers, or any other unforseen unfavorable circumstances arise, we may require additional funding and there can be no assurance that such funding will be available at all or on acceptable terms.\nA significant or prolonged economic downturn would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by general economic conditions and the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve. On an aggregate basis, our clients may be less likely to hire as many senior executives during economic downturns and periods of economic uncertainty. To the extent our clients delay or reduce hiring senior executives due to an economic downturn or economic uncertainty, our results of operations will be adversely affected. A continued economic downturn or period of economic uncertainty and a decline in the level of business activity of our clients would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal economic developments and conditions in the geographic regions and industries from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for our services is affected by global economic conditions and the general level of economic activity in the geographic regions and industries in which we operate. The concentration of our business in certain geographic regions and/or industries exacerbates this risk. For example, 30% of our net revenue in 2014 was derived from providing our services to the financial services industry. When conditions in the global economy, including the credit markets, deteriorate, or economic activity slows, companies may hire fewer permanent employees and some companies, as a cost-saving measure, may choose to rely on their own human resources departments rather than third-party search firms to find talent. Certain of the geographic regions and industries in which we operate have recently deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. If the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general deteriorate, or the demand for our services in a significant industry decreases, our cash flows, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend substantially on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace. If we lose the services of these individuals, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth and success depend in large part on the managerial and leadership skills of our senior management team, particularly David C. Nocifora, our incoming chief executive officer and formerly our chief operating officer; and William J. Keneally, our chief financial officer. We rely on our senior management team to market our business, manage our globally dispersed business operations and hire and retain qualified executive search consultants. The success of our growth efforts depends on significant management attention to integration and coordination. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Board of Directors of the Company determined that, effective April 16, 2015, David C. Nocifora will replace Brian M. Sullivan as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Nocifora will also join the Company's Board of Directors.\nIf we are unable to prevent our executive search consultants from taking our clients or our executive search consultants with them to a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop and maintain strong, long-term relationships with our clients. Although we work on building these relationships between our firm and our clients, in many cases, one or two executive search consultants have primary responsibility for a client relationship. Additionally, a limited number of executive search consultants have primary responsibility for a disproportionate share of our business. In 2014, for example, our top three executive search consultants had primary responsibility for generating business equal to approximately 8% of our net revenues, and our top ten executive search consultants had primary responsibility for generating business equal to approximately 21% of our net revenues. As of December 31, 2014, two of top ten executive search consultants have left the firm.\nAlthough our executive officers are subject to non-compete agreements as part of their employment contracts, we do not generally enter into non-competition agreements with our executive search consultants, our executive search consultants are not contractually prohibited from leaving or joining one of our competitors and some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of us. We may also lose clients if the departing executive search consultant has widespread name recognition or a reputation as a specialist in executing searches in a specific industry or management function. Although our employment contracts prohibit former executive search consultants from soliciting any of our employees for a period of one year, we may lose additional executive search consultants if they choose to join the departing executive search consultant at another executive search firm. If we fail to limit departing executive search consultants from moving business or recruiting our executive search consultants to a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBecause existing clients may restrict us from recruiting their employees we may be unable, or be perceived by prospective clients as being unable, to fill existing or prospective executive search assignments, and prospective clients may not engage us, impeding our growth.\nClients frequently require us to refrain from recruiting certain of their employees when conducting executive searches on behalf of other clients. These restrictions generally remain in effect for no more than one year following the commencement of an engagement. However, the specific duration and scope of the off-limits arrangements depend on the length of the client relationship, the frequency with which the client engages us to perform searches and the potential for future business with the client. If a prospective client believes that we are overly restricted by these off-limits arrangements from recruiting the employees of our existing clients, these prospective clients may not engage us to perform their executive searches, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face aggressive competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe global executive search industry is extremely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with other large global executive search firms and smaller specialty firms. Some of our competitors possess greater financial and other resources, greater name recognition and longer operating histories than we do in particular markets or practice areas. Additionally, specialty firms can focus on regional or functional markets or on particular industries. To the extent our competitors are better capitalized and have access to greater financial and other resources, these competitors may be better positioned to attract executive search consultants, expand their business and weather any economic downturns. There are limited barriers to entry into the search industry and new search firms continue to enter the market. Many executive search firms that have a smaller client base may be subject to fewer off-limits arrangements. Our competitors sometimes reduce their fees in order to attract clients and increase market share. Because we typically do not discount our fees, we may experience some loss of net revenue. We may not be able to continue to compete effectively with existing or potential competitors. Our inability to meet these competitive challenges would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, our clients or prospective clients may decide to perform executive searches using in-house personnel.\nWe rely heavily on information management systems and any interruptions or loss of key client data could adversely effect our business.\nOur success depends upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage substantial amounts of information. To achieve our goals, we must continue to improve, upgrade and invest in our information management systems. We may be unable to license, design and implement, in a cost-effective and timely manner, improved information systems that allow us to compete effectively. In addition, business process re-engineering efforts may result in a change in software platforms and programs. In addition to the cost of licensing, designing and implementing new information systems, such efforts may present transitional problems. Finally, although our data center is maintained at a third-party location, if we experience any interruptions or loss in our information processing capabilities or loss of key client data, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience security breaches that could lead to loss of data privacy that could result in liability and negatively impact our reputation.\nDespite our efforts in implementation of security measures, our operating systems are vulnerable to security breaches. Continued occurrences of data breaches across various entities and organizations provides evidence of security breach risk. Such breaches could lead to a disruption of our operations and improper disclosure of confidential information, resulting in legal liability, increased costs and loss of revenue.\nWe face the risk of liability in the services we perform and significant uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to potential claims with respect to the executive search process. A client could assert a claim for violations of off-limits arrangements, breaches of confidentiality agreements or professional malpractice. In addition, candidates and client employees could assert claims against us. Possible claims include failure to maintain the confidentiality of the candidate\u2019s employment search or for discrimination or other violations of employment laws or professional malpractice. In various countries, we are subject to data protection laws impacting the processing of candidate information. We maintain professional liability insurance in amounts and coverage that we believe are adequate, however, we cannot guarantee that our insurance will cover all claims or that coverage will always be available or sufficient. Significant uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to successfully integrate executive search consultants may have an adverse effect on our business.\nMuch of our net revenue growth since 2004 is due to adding executive search consultants or acquiring established businesses in different geographic locations. We expect to continue to grow by, among other things, selectively adding executive search consultants. We may not, however, be able to identify appropriate executive search consultants, consummate such additions on satisfactory terms or integrate the acquired practices effectively and profitably into our existing operations. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to complete the integration of executive search consultants successfully into our operations. Failure to successfully integrate recently hired executive search\nconsultants and complementary practices may adversely affect our profitability by creating operating inefficiencies that could increase operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues and reduce operating income. Further, the clients of recently hired executive search consultants may choose not to move their business to us.\nWe may not be able to manage effectively our expanding operations, which may impede our growth and/or negatively impact our performance.\nSince 2004, we have experienced a period of rapid growth. This places a significant strain on our managerial and operational resources. Our number of employees grew from 88 as of December 31, 2004, to 631 as of December 31, 2014, mainly as a result of opening new non-U.S. locations, adding executive search consultants and staff supporting such executive search consultants, and acquisitions. To accommodate our future expected growth, we may need to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems, procedures and controls throughout many different locations. These efforts may not be successful. Additionally, opening new office locations may strain our financial and management resources. Our failure to expand and integrate these systems, procedures and office locations efficiently could cause our expenses to increase disproportionately and our net revenues to decline or grow more slowly than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur multinational operations may be adversely affected by economic, social, political and legal risks.\nWe generate substantial net revenue outside the United States. We offer our services through twenty three countries outside the U.S. We are exposed to the risk of changes in economic, social, political and legal conditions inherent in international operations, which could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, we conduct business in countries where the legal systems, local laws and trade practices are unsettled and evolving. Commercial laws in these countries are sometimes vague, arbitrary and inconsistently applied. If we fail to comply with local laws, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. In addition, the global nature of our operations poses challenges to our management as well as our financial and accounting systems. Failure to meet these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant currency fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.\nWith operations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific, we conduct business using various currencies. In 2014, 42% of our fee revenue was generated outside of North America. As we typically transact business in the local currency, our profitability may be impacted by the translation of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and our business, financial condition and results of operations. This risk is offset by payment of expenditures in local currencies, to offset revenue exposure.\nThe failure to timely align our cost structure with net revenue could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must ensure that our costs and workforce continue to be in proportion to demand for our services. In particular, local laws in some of the countries we operate in make it more difficult and time consuming to appropriately adjust staffing levels. Failure to timely align our cost structure and headcount with net revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to access credit, or if we are only able to do so at significantly higher costs, could limit our ability to grow and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the current economic environment, banks may strictly enforce the terms of our credit agreement. Although we are currently in compliance with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility, a further deterioration of economic conditions may negatively impact our business resulting in our failure to comply with these covenants in the future, which could limit our ability to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility. We may not be able to secure alternative financing or may only be able to do so at significantly higher costs, and this could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of liability arising out of the operation of our business and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to potential claims with respect to the executive search process. A client could assert a claim for violations of off-limits arrangements, breaches of confidentiality agreements or professional malpractice. In addition, candidates and client employees could assert claims against us. Possible claims include failure to maintain the confidentiality of the candidate\u2019s employment search or for discrimination or other violations of employment laws or professional malpractice. In various countries, we are subject to data protection laws impacting the processing of candidate information. We may also be subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims by our employees or former employees, shareholders or other third parties that arise in the regular course of our business or otherwise. We maintain professional liability insurance in amounts and coverage that we believe are adequate. However, we cannot guarantee that our insurance will cover all claims or that coverage will always be available or sufficient. Significant uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Even if we have adequate insurance coverage or we are subject to claims that we do not believe have merit, litigation could result in significant costs and the diversion of management attention. Litigation could also result in unfavorable publicity. For example, a complaint submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Comission by a former employee has recently resulted in media coverage. We are aware of several law firms that has announced they are investigating whether we violated securities laws in connection with events surrounding this claim and our recent announcement of preliminary financial results for 2014. On February 27, 2015 an announcement was made that class action has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of CTPartners Executive Search Inc. common stock during the period between February 26, 2014 and January 28, 2015.\nWhile we do not believe that the EEOC claim has merit or that we have violated securities laws, unfavorable media coverage, regardless of the truth of any allegations or the validity of any claim, could further negatively affect our professional reputation and brand name and could result in other current or former employees bringing similar claims in the future, regardless of whether such claims have merit.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT exchange, it may remain illiquid, or \u201cthinly traded,\u201d which can increase volatility in the share price and make it difficult for investors to buy or sell shares in the public market without materially affecting the quoted share price. Further, investors seeking to buy or sell a certain quantity of our shares in the public market may be unable to do so within one or more trading days. If limited trading in our stock continues, it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares in the market at any given time at prevailing prices. We currently have one analyst covering our Company, which will likely impact trading volume.\nBroad market and industry factors also may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause wide fluctuations in our stock price may include, among other things:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\noverall conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u2022\naddition or loss of significant clients;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022\nannouncements of lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities or industry analysts that elect to follow our common stock; and\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders, including sales by our directors and officers.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. One action has been instituted against us, and we may be the target of more of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, whether or not we are successful in such litigation.\nSales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were 7,270,297 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales will occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future. The shares sold in our initial public offering in 2010 and February 2015 offering are eligible for sale in the public market without restriction by persons other than our affiliates. The restricted shares that were issued to existing equity holders when we converted from a limited liability company to a corporation at the time of our initial public offering are also eligible for sale in the public market without restriction by persons other than our affiliates. Because our shares are relatively thinly-traded and we have a relatively small public float relative to the total number of shares of our common stock that are issued and outstanding, any adverse effect of such sales could be significant. We have also filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. As a result of such registration, any such shares issued to persons other than our affiliates pursuant to our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan are or will be freely tradable in the public market.\nOur principal stockholders may exert substantial influence over us and may exercise their control in a manner adverse to your interests.\nCollectively, our executive officers, directors and significant employee shareholders own 1.8 million shares, or 24.2%, of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014. Because a limited number of persons may exert substantial influence over us, transactions could be difficult or impossible to complete without the support of those persons. It is possible that these persons will exercise control over us in a manner adverse to your interests.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, as a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe currently do not expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we anticipate that all of our earnings in the foreseeable future will be used in the operation and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is currently limited by the covenants of our credit facility and may be further restricted by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities. Accordingly, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our company may be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. The market price for our common stock may never exceed, and may fall below, the price that you pay for our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our rights agreement, charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOn March 4, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement that is designed to prevent a stockholder from acquiring 15% or more of the Company's common stock without approval from the Board of Directors. In additions, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na board of directors whose members can only be dismissed for cause;\n\u2022\nthe right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe limitation on who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which would increase the number of outstanding shares and could thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions; and\n\u2022\nshareholder rights agreement adopted on March 4, 2015.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.", "PERMNO": 12440, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "CTPR"}
