{"cik": "893847", "company": "HAWTHORN BANCSHARES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisk Factors\nWe are identifying important risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition or business and that could cause them to differ materially from the Company's historical results of operations, financial condition or business, or those contemplated by forward-looking statements made herein or elsewhere, by, or on behalf of, the Company. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those factors described below. The risk factors highlighted below are not necessarily the only ones that the Company faces.\nBecause We Primarily Serve Central And West Central Missouri, A Decline In The Local Economic Conditions Could Lower The Company's Profitability. The profitability of Hawthorn is dependent on the profitability of its banking subsidiary, which operates out of central and west central Missouri. The financial condition of this bank is affected by fluctuations in the economic conditions prevailing in the portion of Missouri in which its operations are located. Accordingly, the financial conditions of both Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary would be adversely affected by deterioration in the general economic and real estate climate in Missouri.\nAn increase in unemployment, a decrease in profitability of regional businesses or real estate values or an increase in interest rates are among the factors that could weaken the local economy. With a weaker local economy:\n\u00b7\ncustomers may not want or need the products and services of the Bank,\n\u00b7\nborrowers may be unable to repay their loans,\n\u00b7\nthe value of the collateral security of the Bank's loans to borrowers may decline,\n\u00b7\nthe number of loan delinquencies and foreclosures may increase, and\n\u00b7\nthe overall quality of the Bank's loan portfolio may decline.\nOriginating mortgage loans and consumer loans is a significant source of profits for Hawthorn's banking subsidiary. If individual customers in the local area do not want or need these loans, profits may decrease. Although the Bank could make other investments, the Bank may earn less revenue on these investments than on loans. Also, the Bank's losses on loans may increase if borrowers are unable to make payments on their loans.\nInterest Rate Changes May Reduce The Profitability Of The Company And Of The Bank. The primary source of earnings for Hawthorn's banking subsidiary is net interest income. To be profitable, the Bank has to earn more money in interest and fees on loans and other interest-earning assets than it pays as interest on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities and as other expenses. If prevailing interest rates decrease, the amount of interest the Bank earn on loans and investment securities may decrease more rapidly than the amount of interest the Bank has to pay on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. This would result in a decrease in the profitability of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary.\nChanges in the level or structure of interest rates also affect:\n\u00b7\nthe Bank's ability to originate loans,\n\u00b7\nthe value of the Bank's loan and securities portfolios,\n\u00b7\nthe Bank's ability to realize gains from the sale of loans and securities,\n\u00b7\nthe average life of the Bank's deposits, and\n\u00b7\nthe Bank's ability to obtain deposits.\nFluctuations in interest rates will ultimately affect both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the Bank's assets and liabilities, and the fair value of all interest-earning assets, other than interest-earning assets that mature in the short term. The Bank's interest rate management strategy is designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements by matching the interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities. Although Hawthorn believes that its Bank's current mix of loans, mortgage-backed securities, investment securities and deposits is reasonable, significant fluctuations in interest rates may have a negative effect on the profitability of the Bank.\nOur Business Depends On Our Ability To Successfully Manage Credit Risk. The operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, our banking subsidiary is exposed to the risk that borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. In order to successfully manage credit risk, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our loan officers follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's Profitability Depends On The Bank's Asset Quality And Lending Risks. Success in the banking industry largely depends on the quality of loans and other assets. The loan officers of Hawthorn's banking subsidiary are actively encouraged to identify deteriorating loans. Loans are also monitored and categorized through an analysis of their payment status. The Bank's failure to timely and accurately monitor the quality of its loans and other assets could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary. There is a degree of credit risk associated with any lending activity. The Bank attempts to minimize its credit risk through loan diversification. Although the Bank's loan portfolio is varied, with no undue concentration in any one industry, substantially all of the loans in the portfolio have been made to borrowers in central, west central, and southwest Missouri. Therefore, the loan portfolio is susceptible to factors affecting the central, west central, and southwest Missouri area and the level of non-performing assets is heavily dependent upon local conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of the Bank's non-performing assets will not increase above current levels. High levels of non-performing assets could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary.\nThe Provision For Probable Loan Losses May Need To Be Increased. Hawthorn's banking subsidiary makes a provision for loan losses based upon management's estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio and its consideration of prevailing economic and environmental conditions. The amount of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond the Company's control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. We cannot fully predict the amount or timing of losses or whether the loss allowance will be adequate in the future. The Bank may need to increase the provision for loan losses through additional\nprovisions in the future if, among other things, the financial condition of any of its borrowers deteriorates, if its borrower fails to perform its obligations to it, or if real estate values decline. Furthermore, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank's loan portfolio, provision for loan losses, and real estate acquired by foreclosure. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the provision for loan losses based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of the examination. Any additional provision for probable loan losses, whether required as a result of regulatory review or initiated by Hawthorn itself, may materially alter the financial outlook of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, decided to review how banks estimate losses in the allowance calculation, and it issued the final current expected credit loss standard, or CECL. Currently, the impairment model is based on incurred losses, and investments are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the new CECL model that will become effective for us for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Under the new CECL model promulgated under ASU 2016-13 \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\", we will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The CECL model is expected to result in more timely recognition of credit losses. The ASU will require new disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost, loans and available-for-sale debt securities. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The transition to the CECL model will bring with it significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses under the new parameters.\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of these changes to our financial position and results of operations. We anticipate a significant change in the processes and procedures to calculate the allowance, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. We expect to continue developing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure we are fully compliant with the CECL requirements at its adoption date. The allowance is a material estimate of ours, and given the change from an incurred loss model to a methodology that considers the credit loss over the life of the loan, there is the potential for an increase in the allowance at adoption date. At this time, an estimate of the impact to the Company's financial statements is not known, but the impact could be significantly impacted by the composition, characteristics and quality of the underlying loan portfolio at the time of adoption.\nAdverse Market Conditions In The U.S. Economy And The Markets In Which We Operate Could Adversely Impact The Company's Business. General downward economic trends, reduced availability of commercial credit, and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other. This market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer deficiencies, lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity. Competition among depository institutions for deposits has increased significantly. Financial institutions have experienced decreased access to deposits or borrowings.\nAlthough there has been a modest recovery in the domestic economy, there can be no assurance that the economy will not enter into another recession, whether in the near or long term future. Furthermore, real estate values and the demand for commercial real estate loans have not fully recovered, and reduced availability of commercial credit and continuing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit. Additional market developments such as a relapse or worsening of economic conditions in other parts of the world would likely exacerbate the lingering effects of the difficult market conditions experienced by us and others in the financial services industry and could further slow, stall or reverse the slow recovery in the U.S. A further deterioration of overall market conditions, a continuation of the economic downturn or prolonged economic stagnation in the Company's markets may have a negative impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of its common stock. If the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the economy in areas where we lend were to\nstagnate or decline, this could result in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a resultant adverse effect on the Company's loan portfolio and provision for losses on loans. This may exacerbate the Company's exposure to credit risk, impair the Company's ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers or to estimate the values of its assets and adversely affect the ability of borrowers to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements with us. Negative conditions in the real estate markets where we operate could adversely affect borrowers' ability to repay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral. Real estate values are affected by various factors, including general economic conditions, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters. These factors may adversely impact borrowers' ability to make required payments, which in turn, may negatively impact the Company's financial results. As a result of the difficult market and economic conditions referred to above, there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and for bank regulatory agencies to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. This increased government action may increase costs and limit the Company's ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nWe cannot predict whether the difficult market and economic conditions will improve in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult conditions on the Company, its customers and the other financial institutions in its market. As a result, we may experience increases in foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies, as well as more restricted access to funds, and the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected.\nThe Soundness Of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us. The Company's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nDeterioration In The Housing Market Could Cause Further Increases In Delinquencies And Non-Performing Assets, Including Loan Charge-Offs, And Depress The Company's Income And Growth. The volume of one-to-four family residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit may decrease during economic downturns as a result of, among other things, a decrease in real estate values, an increase in unemployment, a slowdown in housing price appreciation or increases in interest rates. These factors could reduce earnings and consequently the Company's financial condition because:\n\u00b7\nborrowers may not be able to repay their loans;\n\u00b7\nthe value of the collateral securing loans may decline further;\n\u00b7\nthe quality of the Company's loan portfolio may decline further; and\n\u00b7\ncustomers may not want or need the Company's products and services.\nAny of these scenarios could cause an increase in delinquencies and non-performing assets, require us to charge-off a higher percentage of loans, increase substantially the provision for losses on loans, or make fewer loans, which would reduce income.\nThe FDIC's Changes in the Calculation of Deposit Insurance Premiums and Ability to Levy Special Assessments Could Increase The Company's Non-Interest Expense And May Reduce Its Profitability. The range of base assessment rates historically varies from 12 to 45 basis points depending on an institution's risk category, with newly\nadded financial measures resulting in increased assessment rates for institutions heavily relying on brokered deposits to support rapid asset growth. However, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to amend its regulations to redefine the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments. On February 9, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule that defines the assessment base as the average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. The FDIC also imposed a new assessment rate scale (which was revised further in 2016). Under the new system, banks will pay assessments at a rate between 3 and 30 basis points per assets minus tangible equity, depending upon an institution's risk category (the final rule also includes progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the FDIC's reserve ratio reaches certain levels). The rulemaking changes the current assessment rate schedule so the schedule will result in the collection of assessment revenue that is approximately the same as generated under the current rate schedule and current assessment base. Nearly all banks with assets less than $10 billion will pay smaller deposit insurance assessments as a result of the new rule. The majority of the changes in the FDIC's final rule became effective on April 1, 2011. The FDIC has the statutory authority to impose special assessments on insured depository institutions in an amount, and for such purposes, as the FDIC may deem necessary. The change in the calculation methodology for deposit insurance premiums and the possible emergency special assessments could increase non-interest expense and may adversely affect the Company's profitability.\nWe May Elect Or Be Compelled To Seek Additional Capital In The Future, But That Capital May Not Be Available When It Is Needed. We are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support the growth of the Company's business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may elect to raise additional capital for other reasons. In that regard, a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital as a result of a deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market, deteriorating economic conditions, declines in real estate values and other factors. Should we elect or be required by regulatory authorities to raise additional capital, we may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, common stock or securities convertible into common stock, which could dilute your ownership interest in the Company. Although we remain \"well-capitalized\" and have not had a deterioration in liquidity, the future cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside of the Company's control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to us, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIf We Are Unable To Successfully Compete For Customers In The Company's Market Area, The Company's Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Could Be Adversely Affected. Hawthorn's banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in making loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial products and services. The Bank has numerous competitors for customers in its market area.\nSuch competition for loans comes principally from:\n\uf0b7\nother commercial banks\n\uf0b7\nmortgage banking companies\n\uf0b7\nsavings banks\n\uf0b7\nfinance companies\n\uf0b7\nsavings and loan associations\n\uf0b7\ncredit unions\nCompetition for deposits comes principally from:\n\uf0b7\nother commercial banks\n\uf0b7\nbrokerage firms\n\uf0b7\nsavings banks\n\uf0b7\ninsurance companies\n\uf0b7\nsavings and loan associations\n\uf0b7\nmoney market mutual funds\n\uf0b7\ncredit unions\n\uf0b7\nmutual funds (such as corporate and government securities funds)\nMany of these competitors have greater financial resources and name recognition, more locations, more advanced technology and more financial products to offer than the Bank. Competition from larger institutions may increase due to an acceleration of bank mergers and consolidations in Missouri and the rest of the nation. In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act removes many of the remaining restrictions in federal banking law against cross-ownership between banks and\nother financial institutions, such as insurance companies and securities firms. The law will likely increase the number and financial strength of companies that compete directly with the Bank. The profitability of the Bank depends of its continued ability to attract new customers and compete in Missouri. New competitors, as well as the expanding operations of existing competitors, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on the Bank's market share of deposits and loans in the Bank's service areas. If the Bank is unable to successfully compete, its financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe May Experience Difficulties In Managing Growth And In Effectively Integrating Newly Acquired Companies. As part of the Company's general strategy, it may continue to acquire banks and businesses that it believes provide a strategic fit with its business. To the extent that the Company does grow, there can be no assurances that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage such growth. Acquiring other banks and businesses will involve risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\u00b7\npotential exposure to liabilities of the banks and businesses acquired;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the banks and businesses acquired;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and expense of instituting the necessary systems and procedures, including accounting and financial reporting systems, to manage the combined enterprises on a profitable basis;\n\u00b7\npotential disruption to existing business and operations;\n\u00b7\npotential diversion of the time and attention of management; and\n\u00b7\nimpairment of relationships with and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses acquired.\nThe success of the Company's internal growth strategy will depend primarily on the ability of the Bank to generate an increasing level of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels and on acceptable terms without significant increases in non-interest expenses relative to revenues generated. There is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing the Company's internal growth strategy.\nWe May Be Adversely Affected By Changes In Laws And Regulations Affecting The Financial Services Industry. Banks and bank holding companies such as Hawthorn are subject to regulation by both federal and state bank regulatory agencies. The regulations, which are designed to protect borrowers and promote certain social policies, include limitations on the operations of banks and bank holding companies, such as minimum capital requirements and restrictions on dividend payments. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervision and enforcement activities and their examination policies, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by an institution and requiring an increase in a bank's allowance for loan losses. These regulations are not necessarily designed to maximize the profitability of banking institutions.\nIn July 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which enacted substantial changes to the legal framework of the entire financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates the passage of numerous rules and regulations by various regulatory agencies over the next few years. This legislation will change banking regulation and the operating environment of Hawthorn in substantial and unpredictable ways. It could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. Hawthorn cannot predict the impact that the Dodd-Frank Act, and the various regulations issued thereunder will have on its business.\nThese, and other future changes in the banking laws and regulations and tax and accounting rules applicable to financial institutions, could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary.\nThe Short-Term And Long-Term Impact Of The Changing Regulatory Capital Requirements And New Capital Rules Is Uncertain. The federal banking agencies have substantially amended the regulatory capital rules applicable to us and the Bank. The amendments implement the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The amended rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective in January 2015, with certain requirements to be phased in beginning in 2016, and refined the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements to us and the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could further limit the Company's ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.\nThe EGRRCPA directs the federal banking agencies to develop a specified Community Bank Leverage Ratio (that is, the ratio of a bank's equity capital to its consolidated assets) of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. On November 21, 2018, federal regulators released a proposed rulemaking that would, if enacted, provide certain banks and their holding companies with the option to elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules. Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has a community bank leverage ratio, or CBLR, greater than 9% at the time of election. The proposal is described in more detail above under the section entitled \"Regulatory Capital Requirements.\" The Company will continue to monitor this rulemaking. If and when the rulemaking goes into effect, the Company and the Bank will determine whether they are qualified under the community bank leverage ratio framework and, if so, whether it would be possible and advantageous at that time to elect to comply with the community bank leverage ratio framework.\nNon-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending Laws Or Other Laws And Regulations Could Result In Fines Or Sanctions, And Curtail Expansion Opportunities. Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act and Bank Secrecy Act statutes and regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, enforcement actions, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Government imposed and will continue to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks.\nThe Bank Is A Community Bank And Our Ability To Maintain The Bank's Reputation Is Critical To The Success Of Our Business And The Failure To Do So Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Performance. The Bank is a community bank, and its reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's Success Largely Depends On The Efforts Of Its Executive Officers. The success of Hawthorn and its banking subsidiary has been largely dependent on the efforts of David Turner, Chairman, CEO, and President and the other executive officers. These individuals are expected to continue to perform their services. However, the loss of the services of Mr. Turner, or any of the other key executive officers could have a materially adverse effect on Hawthorn and its subsidiary bank.\nIf We Fail To Maintain An Effective System Of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able To Accurately Report Our Financial Results Or Prevent Fraud, And, As A Result, Investors And Depositors Could Lose Confidence In Our Financial Reporting, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business, The Trading Price Of Our Stock, And Our Ability To Attract Additional Deposits. We are required to include in our annual reports filed with the SEC a report from our management regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we documented and evaluated our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules and regulations, which require an annual management report on our internal control over financial reporting, including, among other matters, management's assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting. Failure or circumvention of our system of internal control could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and financial condition, and could result in regulatory actions and loss of investor confidence. Additionally, if we fail to identify and correct any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud, current and potential stockholders and depositors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits.\nWe Are Subject To Security And Operational Risks Relating To Our Use Of Technology That Could Damage Our Reputation And Our Business. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Furthermore, we have access to large amounts of confidential financial information and control substantial financial assets, including those belonging to our customers, to whom we offer remote access, and we regularly transfer substantial financial assets by electronic means. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, our security measures may not be successful.\nIn addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints caused by third parties that facilitate our business activities by providing technology such as software applications, as well as financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure.\nWe also face the potential risk of loss due to fraud, including commercial checking account fraud, automated teller machine (\"ATM\") skimming and trapping, write-offs necessitated by debit card fraud, and other forms of online banking fraud, which are becoming more sophisticated and present new challenges as mobile banking increases, as well as employee fraud. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, and if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Operation Of Our Business, Including Our Interaction With Customers, Are Increasingly Done Via Electronic Means, And This Has Increased Our Risks Related To Cybersecurity. We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business. This includes internally developed systems, the systems of third-party service providers, and digital and mobile technologies. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, and could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. We are exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business, which can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We have observed an increased level of attention in the industry focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber-attacks may be carried out by third parties or insiders using techniques that range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security or overwhelm websites to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. The objectives of cyber-attacks vary widely and can include theft of financial assets, intellectual property, or other sensitive information, including the information belonging to our banking customers. Cyber-attacks may also be directed at disrupting our operations.\nWe may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if we fall victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused; increased cybersecurity protection costs that may include organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation; and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nWe Continually Encounter Technological Change, And We Cannot Predict How Changes In Technology Will Affect Our Business. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by products and services, which include developments in:\n\uf0b7\ntelecommunications\n\uf0b7\ninternet-based banking\n\uf0b7\ndata processing\n\uf0b7\ntelebanking\n\uf0b7\nautomation\n\uf0b7\ndebit cards and so-called \"smart cards\"\nThe effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe Rely On Others To Provide Key Components Of Our Business Infrastructure. Third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively.
