RISK FACTORS\nThe following are material factors known to us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risks described below. Disclosures of risks should not be interpreted to imply that the risks have not already materialized, and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this report.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and we anticipate will continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption across the world. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, some of which have been extended or reimplemented as a result of ongoing waves of COVID-19 cases, with additional challenges resulting from the emergence of new variants of COVID-19. Such measures have impacted, and may continue to affect, our workforce, operations, suppliers and customers. While we have suspended many of the remedial measures we took in the months following the onset of COVID-19, it may be necessary to implement remedial measures such as temporary store closures, reduced store hours, workforce reductions or other steps to conserve cash and curtail other selling general and administrative expenses. There is no certainty that the remedial measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19. Further, such measures could potentially materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and create additional risks for us.\nAmong other things, the pandemic has negatively impacted our workforce and supply chain. We have incurred additional costs as a result of COVID-19 infections at store locations and have, and may continue to, experience difficulties staffing our store locations, which may be exacerbated if we are required to implement vaccine mandates. We also have an increased number of employees\nworking remotely, which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity threats. In addition, during 2021, we experienced elevated levels of product shortages, which were partially due to vendor production delays and global shipping capacity constraints resulting, in part, from the impact of COVID-19. We continue to actively work with our vendors to secure delivery of backordered product.\nThe ultimate magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and the full extent of the material negative impact on our financial and operational results cannot be predicted and will depend on future developments, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy and our customers; the extent of any additional resurgences in cases across the United States, including breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated population; the timing, acceptance, availability and effectiveness of medical treatments and vaccines; the emergence of new strains of COVID-19; labor shortages; and ongoing supply chain disruptions and shortages of certain supplies and the resulting cost inflation. The resumption of our normal business operations may be constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers and/or third-party service providers, and any inability to meet customers\u2019 needs due to the impacts of COVID-19 could negatively impact our business and reputation. Any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may also be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors, such as any additional waves of COVID-19 infections and breakthrough infections.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nOur ability to grow and remain profitable may be limited by direct or indirect competition in the highly-competitive retail tile industry.\nThe retail tile industry in the United States is highly competitive. Participants in the tile industry compete primarily based on product variety, customer service, store location, and price. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete favorably with our competitors in these areas. Our store competitors include large national home centers, regional and local specialty retailers of tile, factory-direct stores, privately-owned, single-site stores and online-only competitors. We also compete indirectly with companies that sell other types of floor coverings, including wood floors, carpet, and vinyl sheet. In the past, we have faced periods of heightened competition that materially affected our results of operations. Certain of our competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied product offerings, and substantially greater financial and other resources than us. Accordingly, we may face periods of intense competition in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our planned growth and future results of operations. Moreover, the barriers to entry into the retail tile industry are relatively low. New or existing retailers could enter our markets and increase the competition that we face. In addition, manufacturers and suppliers of tile and related products, including those whose products we currently sell, could enter the United States retail tile market and start directly competing with us. Further, the retail industry in general is subject to rapid technological change, which may increase the amount of capital we spend in the future as we work to sustain and grow our technological infrastructure and digital commerce capabilities in order to remain competitive. Competition in existing and new markets may also prevent or delay our ability to gain relative market share. Any of the developments described above could have a material adverse effect on our planned growth and future results of operations.\nAny failure by us to successfully anticipate consumer trends may lead to loss of consumer acceptance of our products, resulting in reduced revenues.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing trends in the tile industry and consumer demands in a timely manner. If we fail to identify and respond to emerging trends, consumer acceptance of our merchandise and our image with current or potential customers may be harmed, which could reduce our revenue potential. Additionally, if we misjudge market trends, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to reduce the sales price of such products, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit and cash flow. Conversely, shortages of products that prove popular, or increases in our pricing as a result of general product shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressure, could cause customers to seek alternative sources of such products, as well as other products they may have purchased from us, which could also reduce our revenues.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our online sales, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nConsumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. Any failure on our part to provide an attractive, reliable and user-friendly digital platform that offers a wide assortment of merchandise and meets the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, and have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business and on our business and results of operations. We are vulnerable to certain risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce operations, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, costs and technical issues for upgrades of our website software, computer viruses, changes in applicable federal and state regulations, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns. If not managed, these risks could adversely impact our operating results.\nIf we fail to successfully manage the challenges that our planned growth poses or encounter unexpected difficulties during our expansion, our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nOne of our long-term objectives is to increase revenue and profitability through market share gains. Our ability to achieve market share growth, however, is contingent upon our ability to open new stores and achieve operating results in new stores at the same level as our similarly situated current stores. There can be no assurance that we will be able to open stores in new markets at the rate required to achieve market leadership in such markets, identify and obtain favorable store sites, arrange favorable leases for stores, obtain governmental and other third-party consents, permits, and licenses needed to open or operate stores in a timely manner, train and hire a sufficient number of qualified managers for new stores, attract a strong customer base and brand familiarity in new markets, or successfully compete with established retail tile stores in the new markets that we enter. Failure to open new stores in an effective and cost-efficient manner could place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to retailers who are more adept than us at managing these challenges, which, in turn, could negatively affect our overall operating results.\nWe intend to open additional stores in both our existing markets and new markets, which poses both the possibility of diminishing sales by existing stores in our existing markets and the risk of a slow ramp-up period for stores in new markets.\nIn future periods, we intend to continue opening stores in new and existing markets. Because our stores typically draw customers from their local areas, additional stores may draw customers away from nearby existing stores and may cause comparable store sales performance at those existing stores to decline, which may adversely affect our overall operating results. Additionally, stores in new markets typically have a ramp-up period before sales become steady enough for such stores to be profitable. Our ability to open additional stores will be dependent on our ability to promote and/or recruit enough qualified store managers, assistant store managers, and sales associates. The time and effort required to train and supervise a large number of new managers and associates and integrate them into our culture may divert resources from our existing stores. If we are unable to profitably open additional stores in both new and existing markets and limit the adverse impact of those new stores on existing stores, our comparable store sales and overall operating results may be reduced during the implementation of our expansion strategy.\nAny future expansion will be dependent upon, and limited by, the availability of adequate capital.\nOur expansion strategy will require adequate capital for, among other purposes, opening new stores, distribution centers, and manufacturing facilities, as well as entering new markets. Such expenditures will include researching real estate and consumer markets, leases, inventory, property and equipment costs, integration of new stores and markets into company-wide systems and programs, and other costs associated with new stores and market entry expenses and growth. If cash generated internally is insufficient to fund capital requirements, we will require additional debt or equity financing. Adequate financing may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms satisfactory to us. In addition, our credit facility may limit the amount of capital expenditures that we may make annually, depending on our rent adjusted leverage ratio. If we fail to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future or we are unable to make capital expenditures under our credit facility, we could be forced to curtail our expansion strategies by reducing or delaying capital expenditures relating to new stores and new market entry. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fund our current plans for the opening of new stores or entry into new markets.\nOur success depends on the effectiveness of our marketing strategy.\nWe believe that our growth was achieved in part through the effectiveness of our marketing strategies. Prior to 2018, we used internet, print, and radio advertisements containing discounts and promotional offers to encourage customers to visit our stores. A significant portion of our advertising was invested to support the opening of new stores and directed at professional customers. Beginning in late 2017, we de-emphasized the use of discount offers to attract customers. Limited use of discount and promotional offers in future periods could fail to attract customers, resulting in a decrease in store traffic. We may need to further increase our marketing expense to support our business strategies in the future. If our marketing strategies fail to draw customers in the future, or if the cost of advertising or other marketing materials increases significantly, we could experience declines in our net sales and operating results.\nIn addition, there has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms. Negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be posted on social media platforms or other electronic means at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. Any harm to us or the products we sell may be immediate without allowing us an opportunity for redress or correction. We also use social media platforms as marketing tools, and our marketing efforts through social media platforms may not be successful, and the availability of these platforms may make it easier for smaller competitors to compete with us.\nRisks Related to our Business, Operations and Financial Condition\nOur comparable store sales fluctuate due to a variety of economic, operating, industry and environmental factors and may not be a fair indicator of our overall performance.\nOur comparable store sales have experienced fluctuations, which can be expected to continue. Numerous factors affect our comparable store sales results, including, among others, the timing of new and relocated store openings, the relative proportion of new and relocated stores to mature stores, cannibalization resulting from the opening of new stores in existing markets, changes in advertising and other operating costs, the timing and level of markdowns, changes in our product mix, weather conditions, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, retail trends, the retail sales environment, economic and geopolitical conditions, inflation, the impact of competition, and our ability to execute our business strategy, as well as the impact of COVID-19, including resurgences in infections throughout the United States, and governmental measures implemented to try to contain the pandemic. As a result, comparable store sales or operating results may fluctuate and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our comparable store sales may not be a reliable indicator of our future overall operating performance.\nIf customers are unable to obtain third-party financing at satisfactory rates, sales of our products could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, affected by various economic factors. In certain markets, deterioration in the economic environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to reduced consumer and business spending, including by our customers, and continued deterioration, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, may lead to further reduced consumer and business spending. It may also cause customers to shift their spending to products that we either do not sell or that generate lower profitability for us. Further, reduced access to credit may adversely affect the ability of consumers to purchase our products. This potential reduction in access to credit may adversely impact our ability to offer customers credit card financing through third-party credit providers on terms similar to those offered currently, or at all. In addition, economic conditions, including decreases in access to credit and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted, and may continue to result, in financial difficulties, leading to restructuring, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, which may adversely impact our industry, business, and results of operations.\nThe burden of incurring debt under our existing credit facility could adversely affect us and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions.\nWe entered into a credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., Fifth Third Bank and Citizens Bank on September 18, 2018, which was amended November 16, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had $5.0 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit, leaving $92.6 million available for future borrowings. The terms of our credit facility could have serious consequences for us, including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, expansion strategy, or other needs and increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility in planning for, adverse changes in economic, industry, and competitive conditions, such as the potential impact of COVID-19 on our ability to comply with the financial covenants under the credit facility. Our credit facility also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including, among other things, our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell assets (including pursuant to sale and leaseback transactions), make investments, acquisitions, loans, or advances, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend our organizational documents and change our lines of business. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility, which would allow the lender to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit or seek amendments to our debt agreements that would provide for terms more favorable to our lenders, which we may have to accept under the circumstances. If we are unable to repay any amounts due, our lenders under our credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure that indebtedness.\nAny future increase in the level of our indebtedness will likely increase our interest expense, which could negatively impact our profitability, and we are vulnerable to changes in variable interest rates. Current interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility are variable and include the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). LIBOR is in the process of being phased out and may be replaced by other benchmark rates; at this time, the future of LIBOR remains uncertain, and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phase out could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. The phase out of LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets and cost of funding. Furthermore, while our credit facility contains \u201cfallback\u201d provisions providing for alternative rate\ncalculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable, these \u201cfallback\u201d provisions may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or successor rates.\nIf we are unable to renew or replace current store leases, or if we are unable to enter into leases for additional stores on favorable terms, or if one or more of our current leases is terminated prior to expiration of its stated term and we cannot find suitable alternate store locations, our growth and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nWe currently lease all of our store locations and certain distribution center locations. Many of our current leases provide us with the unilateral option to renew for several additional rental periods at specific rental rates. Our ability to renegotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location, and our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms for additional store locations, could depend on conditions in the real estate market, including the impact of COVID-19, competition for desirable properties, our relationships with current and prospective landlords, or other factors that are not within our control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively impact our growth and profitability.\nOur results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in material and energy costs.\nOur results may be affected by the prices of the materials used in the manufacture of tile, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories that we sell. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including: oil prices, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, labor costs, including those resulting from labor shortages, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates, inflation, geopolitical conditions such as the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the resulting sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries, and government regulation. For instance, many of our vendors have begun to communicate price increases in response to inflationary cost pressure, which, combined with escalated international shipping rates, is resulting in an increase in the cost of our inventory and corresponding pressure on our gross margin rates. While we seek to manage price and availability risks related to supplies through procurement strategies, these efforts may not be successful, and we may experience adverse impacts due to rising prices of such products. In addition, energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution from the manufacturer to our distribution centers and from our regional distribution centers to our stores, utility costs for our distribution and manufacturing centers and stores, and overall costs to purchase products from our suppliers.\nWhile we have adjusted, and plan to continue to adjust, our pricing as a result of the current cost pressures described above, we may not be able to adjust the prices of our products, especially in the short-term, to recover any cost increases in materials and energy. A continual rise in material and energy costs could also adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, changes in climate and geopolitical events could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe threat or occurrence of one or more natural disasters or other extreme weather events, the nature, frequency and severity of which may be negatively impacted by climate change, and the threat or outbreak of terrorism, civil unrest, political instability, such as the Russia-Ukraine crisis, a public health epidemic or pandemic, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other hostilities, conflicts or similar adverse events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. These events may disrupt supply chains, resulting in increased costs and shipping delays, increase costs of energy and raw materials, result in damage to, or destruction or closure of, our stores, distribution centers and other properties or those of our suppliers, customers and other business partners, as well as injuries or loss of life. Such events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and other properties, can modify consumer purchasing patterns and decrease disposable income, and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, we cannot provide any assurance that any measures we may take will be successful, and delays in recovery may be significant.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own and depend on cash flow from The Tile Shop to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own or material assets other than the equity of our subsidiaries. All of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries, including The Tile Shop. As a holding company, we will require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet cash requirements. The terms of any future credit facility may restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring cash or other assets to us, although our current facility does not restrict this action. If there is an insolvency, liquidation, or other reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, our stockholders likely will have no right to proceed against their assets. Creditors of those subsidiaries will be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of those subsidiaries before we, as an equity holder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from that sale or disposal. If The Tile Shop is unable to pay dividends or make other payments to us when needed, we will be unable to satisfy our obligations.\nOur failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, trade dress and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, and assignment and licensing arrangements. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors or other third parties will not infringe upon our intellectual property rights, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nClimate change may adversely impact our business.\nRising global average temperatures due to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changes in weather patterns and the increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather events (such as floods, droughts, wildfires and severe storms) could, among other things, adversely impact the ability to extract natural stones from quarries, which is a key resource for a number of our products, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and the productivity of manufacturers on which we rely, disrupt retail operations and foot traffic in consumer markets, damage or destroy our stores, and increase our product costs.\nThe increasing focus by stakeholders on environmental, social and governance policies and practices could result in additional costs, and could adversely impact our reputation, consumer perception, employee retention, and willingness of third parties to do business with us.\nThere has been increased focus from our stakeholders, including investors, consumers and employees, on our environmental, social, or governance (\u201cESG\u201d) policies and practices, including corporate citizenship and sustainability. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies\u2019 ESG practices continues to grow. If our ESG policies and practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or stakeholders\u2019 evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, support for local communities, Board and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, corporate governance and transparency and employing ESG strategies in our operations, our brand, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and customers and suppliers may be unwilling to do business with us.\nWe could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices, as well as any initiatives or goals we may establish or announce, including those related to climate change. If we do establish such initiatives or goals, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategy or that we will be successful in achieving such initiatives or goals, and we will remain subject to climate change risks regardless. As a result, the effects of climate change and increased focus by stakeholders on ESG matters could have short- and long-term impacts on our business and operations. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations among jurisdictions and expected additional regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change where we operate.\nIf we fail to adopt ESG standards or practices as quickly as stakeholders desire, fail, or are perceived to fail, in our achievement of any initiatives or goals, or fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on any such initiatives and goals, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth may be adversely impacted. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Labor and Supply Chain\nIf we fail to identify and maintain relationships with a sufficient number of suppliers, our ability to obtain products that meet our high quality standards at attractive prices could be adversely affected.\nWe purchase flooring and other products directly from suppliers located around the world. However, we do not have long-term contractual supply agreements with our suppliers that obligate them to supply us with products exclusively or at specified quantities or prices. As a result, our current suppliers may decide to sell products to our competitors and may not continue selling products to us. In order to retain the competitive advantage that we believe results from these relationships, we need to continue to identify, develop and maintain relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our high standards for quality and our requirements for flooring and other products in a timely and efficient manner at attractive prices. The need to develop new relationships will be particularly important as we seek to expand our operations and enhance our product offerings in the future. The loss of one or more of our existing suppliers or our inability to develop relationships with new suppliers could reduce our competitiveness, slow our plans for further expansion, and cause our net sales and operating results to be adversely affected. In addition, any failure to manage our inventory effectively could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our sales could be\nadversely affected when we experience shortages of key items; further, any inability to meet our customers\u2019 product needs could also adversely affect sales of other related products.\nWe source the products that we stock and sell from approximately 170 domestic and international suppliers. We source a large number of those products from foreign manufacturers, including 50% of our products from a group of ten suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. Our largest supplier accounted for approximately 13% of our total purchases in 2021. We generally take title to these products sourced from foreign suppliers overseas and are responsible for arranging shipment to our distribution centers.\nDuring both 2020 and 2021, we experienced an elevated level of product outages, which were partially due to vendor production delays and global shipping capacity constraints resulting, in part, from the impact of COVID-19. We continue to actively work with our vendors to secure delivery of backordered product. Additionally, many of our vendors have begun to communicate price increases in response to inflationary cost pressure, which, combined with escalated international shipping rates, is resulting in an increase in the cost of our inventory and corresponding pressure on our gross margin rates. Geopolitical conditions, such as the current Russia-Ukraine crisis, may lead to additional price increases and shipping delays. In response to this cost pressure, we have adjusted, and plan to continue to adjust, our pricing; however, we cannot provide any assurance that our attempts to mitigate the impact of price increase imposed by our vendors will be successful, or that customers will continue to purchase our products at adjusted prices.\nOther factors that may impact our suppliers, including financial instability among key suppliers, political instability, the impact of pandemics or other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, inflation and transport capacity and costs, are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupt the movement of products through our supply chain or increase the costs of our products.\nOur reliance on foreign suppliers increases our risk of not obtaining adequate, timely and cost-effective products and other risks involved in foreign operations, including foreign currency translation.\nThe risks associated with direct sourcing from overseas manufacturers may be higher than the risks associated with our traditional domestic suppliers. Foreign sourcing subjects us to a number of risks, including long lead times; work stoppages; shipping delays and interruptions; product quality issues; employee rights issues; other social concerns; public health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted our global supply chain and resulted in additional expenses and delays outside of our control, and may continue to do so for an extended period of time; political instability; acts of terrorism; economic disruptions; the imposition of tariffs, including those imposed by the United States on goods imported from China, duties, quotas, import and export controls and other trade restrictions, as well as the possibility of a global trade war; changes in governmental policies, including potential adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of laws (if any) relating to the protection of intellectual property or data security; and other events. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on us.\nReductions in the value of the U.S. dollar or revaluation of foreign currencies used could ultimately increase the prices that we pay for our products. Furthermore, volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic may result in significant fluctuations in exchange rates.\nIn addition, all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S. are subject to duties collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We may be subjected to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of import privileges if we or our suppliers are found to be in violation of U.S. laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products. If duties were to be significantly increased, it could have a material adverse impact on us.\nOur ability to offer compelling products, particularly products made of unique stone, depends on the continued availability of sufficient suitable natural products.\nOur business strategy depends on offering a wide assortment of compelling products to our customers. We sell, among other things, products made from various natural stones from quarries throughout the world. Our ability to obtain an adequate volume and quality of hard-to-find products depends on our suppliers\u2019 ability to furnish those products, which, in turn, could be affected by many things, including the exhaustion of stone quarries or the impact of natural disasters or other extreme weather events, which may be impacted by climate change, on the ability to access or efficiently extract resources from such quarries. If our suppliers cannot deliver sufficient products, and we cannot find replacement suppliers, our net sales and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to provide timely delivery to our customers, and any disruption in our delivery capabilities or our related planning and control processes may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success is due in part to our ability to deliver products quickly to our customers, which requires successful planning and distribution infrastructure, including ordering, transportation and receipt processing, and the ability of suppliers to meet distribution requirements. Our ability to maintain this success depends on the continued identification and implementation of improvements to our\nplanning processes, distribution infrastructure, and supply chain. We also need to ensure that our distribution infrastructure and supply chain keep pace with our anticipated growth and increased number of stores. The cost of these enhanced processes could be significant, and any failure to maintain, grow, or improve them could adversely affect our operating results. Our business could also be adversely affected if there are delays in product shipments due to freight difficulties, strikes, or other difficulties at our suppliers\u2019 principal transport providers, or otherwise. For instance, during both 2021 and 2020, the impact of the supply chain disruptions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and labor shortages negatively affected our ability to obtain certain products in a timely manner and may continue to cause delays going forward.\nWe depend on a few key employees, and if we lose the services of these employees, we may not be able to run our business effectively.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key executive, merchandising, marketing, and sales personnel who share our values and are able to operate effectively consistent with our culture. We have had changes in our senior management team over the past three years and have promoted or hired new employees to fill certain roles. Our inability to effectively integrate the newly-hired senior managers into our business processes, controls, systems and culture could have a material adverse effect on us. If any of our key employees ceases to be employed by us, we would need to hire additional qualified personnel and could experience delays in filling those roles. Our ability to successfully hire other experienced and qualified key employees cannot be assured and may be difficult because we face competition for these professionals from our competitors, our suppliers and other companies operating in our industry, particularly for employees who can work remotely, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased remote opportunities. As a result, the loss or unavailability of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, ineffective succession planning could result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.\nIf we fail to hire, train, and retain qualified store managers, sales associates, and other employees, our enhanced customer service could be compromised and we could lose sales to our competitors.\nA key element of our competitive strategy is to provide product expertise to our customers through our extensively trained, commissioned sales associates. We may be constrained in hiring and retaining sufficient qualified employees to support our strategy due to general labor shortages in our industry, including potential employee attrition in connection with any COVID-19 vaccine or testing mandates that may be implemented. In addition, a lack of qualified personnel or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and managers as needed in the future, including qualified sales personnel, our level of customer service may decline, which may decrease our revenues and profitability.\nOur ability to control labor costs is limited, which may negatively affect our business.\nOur ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations, and health and other insurance costs. If our labor and/or benefit costs increase, we may not be able to hire or maintain qualified personnel to the extent necessary to execute our competitive strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover future claims.\nWe maintain various insurance policies for employee health and workers\u2019 compensation. We are self-insured on certain health insurance plans and are responsible for losses up to a certain limit for these respective plans. We are also self-insured with regard to workers\u2019 compensation coverage, in which case we are responsible for losses up to certain retention limits on both a per-claim and aggregate basis.\nFor policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Fluctuating healthcare costs, our significant growth rate and changes from our past experience with workers\u2019 compensation claims could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or employee health insurance costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient, and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nWhile we have implemented personal safety measures at all of our facilities where our employees are working onsite, any actions we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in COVID-19-related claims. Changes to state workers\u2019 compensation laws may increase our potential liability for such claims.\nWe also maintain third-party insurance coverage against various other liability risks and risks of property loss, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage. Potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements, resulting in significant uninsured liabilities, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, claims brought against us have resulted in, and additional claims could further result in, increased directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance premiums and a reduction in coverage, which could negatively affect us, including by increasing our insurance costs and impacting our ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nCompliance with laws or changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business.\nWe must comply with various laws and regulations at the local, regional, state, federal, and international levels. These laws and regulations change frequently, and such changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and suppliers. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new legislation that affects employment/labor, trade, product safety, transportation/logistics, energy costs, health care, tax, environmental issues, including the impact of climate change, or compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The evolving and at times overlapping regulatory regimes to which the Company is subject may change at any time, including as a result of changes in the U.S. political environment; for instance, various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative actions to increase tax revenue, and the reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into U.S. law in December 2017 could be reduced or rescinded by future tax law changes. In addition, changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business. In addition, a number of legal and regulatory measures and social initiatives have been introduced in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas and other carbon emissions. Any such initiatives, restrictions and requirements could restrict, or require us to make changes to, our operating activities, which could increase our operating costs, require us to make capital improvements to our properties, increase our energy, supply and transportation costs or limit their availability, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, and these effects could be material to us.\nWe may also be subject to audits by various taxing authorities. Changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf our suppliers do not use ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation could be harmed due to negative publicity and we could be subject to legal risk.\nWe do not control the operations of our suppliers. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will comply with applicable environmental, labor and other laws and regulations or operate in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Violation of environmental, labor or other laws by our suppliers or their failure to operate in a legal, ethical, or responsible manner could reduce demand for our products if, as a result of such violation or failure, we attract negative publicity. Further, such conduct could expose us to legal risks as a result of the purchase of products from non-compliant suppliers.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar transactional taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe application of sales tax and other indirect taxes on cross border sales by remote sellers is continuing to change and evolve. In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., a case challenging the prior law under which sellers were not required to collect sales and use tax unless they have a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. This decision allowed states to adopt new or enforce existing laws requiring sellers to collect and remit sales and use tax, even in states in which the seller has no presence. The adoption or enforcement of any such legislation could result in additional sales and use tax collection responsibility for certain of our businesses. A number of states have already begun, or have positioned themselves to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote sellers, and the details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. While we now collect, remit, and report sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax, it is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for periods for which certain of our businesses did not collect sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful, it could result in tax liabilities, including for past sales taxes and penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings and, while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, become involved in stockholder, consumer, employment, tort or other litigation, which may include claims and proceedings arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nTechnology-Related Risks\nOur business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to protect the integrity and security of our customer information.\nIn connection with payment card sales and other transactions, including bank cards, debit cards, credit cards and other merchant cards, we process and transmit confidential banking and payment card information. Additionally, as part of our normal business activities, we collect and store sensitive personal information related to our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of third parties upon which we rely, may be vulnerable to criminal cyber-attacks or security incidents due to employee or service provider error, third-party action, including actions of foreign actors, which risk may be exacerbated by the current Russia-Ukraine crisis and U.S. and international response, insider attacks, phishing or denial-of-service attacks, ransomware or other malware, social engineering, malfeasance, other unauthorized physical or electronic access, or other vulnerabilities. Any such incidents could compromise our networks, or those of our vendors, or disrupt our or our vendors\u2019 critical systems, and the information stored there, such as personal identification information or funds, could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, corrupted or stolen. Third parties may have the technology and know-how to breach the security of this information, and our security measures and those of our banks, merchant card processing and other technology suppliers may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, we face increased information technology security and fraud risks as a result of our increased reliance on working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems.\nWe also incur costs in order to comply with cybersecurity or data privacy regulations or with requirements imposed by business partners; for instance, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether successful or not, would harm our reputation and could damage our competitive position and cause the loss of customers. In addition, any such breach could subject us to litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties or costly response measures, and we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses relating to such events. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf our management information systems experience disruptions, it could disrupt our business and reduce our net sales.\nWe depend on our management information systems to integrate the activities of our stores, to process orders, to manage inventory, to purchase merchandise and to sell and ship goods on a timely basis. We may experience operational problems with our information systems, as well as loss of funds, intellectual property or other proprietary information, as a result of system failures, viruses, computer \u201chackers\u201d or other causes. We may incur significant expenses in order to repair any such operational problems and could suffer reputational damage. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to our stores and customers or lost sales. Accordingly, if our network is disrupted, we may experience delayed communications within our operations and between our customers and ourselves. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe selection and implementation of information technology initiatives may impact our operational efficiency and productivity.\nIn order to better manage our business, we expect to invest in our information systems. In doing so, we must select the correct investments and implement them in an efficient manner. The costs, potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. For instance, we may experience occasional system interruptions and delays, as a result of routine maintenance, periodic updates, implementation of new technology or other factors, that make our information systems unavailable or slow to respond, including the interaction of our information systems with those of third parties. Furthermore, these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or unexpectedly costly\nmanner. Accordingly, issues relating to our selection and implementation of information technology initiatives may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe may be unable to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) and may incur additional costs as a result of our Nasdaq listing.\nOur common stock re-commenced trading on the Nasdaq in June 2021. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements and standards to which we are subject. A delisting of our common stock could negatively affect the price and liquidity of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, we incur, and may incur additional, costs as a result of compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s rules and requirements.\nThe market price of our securities may decline and/or be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Future fluctuations could be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this report, including:\n\uf0b7our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;\n\uf0b7the public\u2019s reaction to our filings with the SEC, our press releases and other public announcements;\n\uf0b7the degree of trading liquidity in our common stock, including our ability to remain listed on Nasdaq;\n\uf0b7changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry;\n\uf0b7variations in general economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\uf0b7actions of our current stockholders, including purchases or sales of common stock by our directors and executive officers;\n\uf0b7the arrival or departure of key personnel; and\n\uf0b7other developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.\nIn addition, the stock market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies but may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance.\nWe suspended our quarterly dividend program and cancelled our stock repurchase program; as such, appreciation in the price of our common stock may be the only method to realize a return on your investment.\nIn October 2019, we suspended our quarterly cash dividend program and cancelled our stock repurchase program to focus on debt reduction and continued investment in strategic initiatives; since then, we have paid a special cash dividend of $0.65 per share in November 2021, but have not resumed our quarterly cash dividend or repurchase programs. Any future determination with respect to the payment of dividends or stock repurchases is at the discretion of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d or the \u201cBoard\u201d) and is dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, tax treatment of dividends in the United States, potential future contractual restrictions contained in credit agreements and other agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We can provide no assurance that we will pay any dividends to our stockholders in the future, or as to the amount of any such dividends, or that we will engage in stock repurchases. Our election not to pay a quarterly dividend or repurchase stock may negatively impact our reputation, our stock price, and investor confidence in us.\nConcentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, beneficially hold approximately 30% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, have the ability to influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that, alone or together, could have the effect of delaying or preventing hostile takeovers or changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include, among other things, a classified Board of Directors; no cumulative voting in the election of directors; the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director; the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including determining the price, voting rights and other terms of such shares, without stockholder approval; requiring approval of certain transactions by the Independent Transaction\nCommittee of the Board; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent and providing that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Board of Directors; limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers; controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings; allowing the Board of Directors to postpone or reschedule special meetings of stockholders; providing that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and advance notice procedures for nominating director candidates or proposing matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. In addition, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law that may impair takeover attempts, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless certain approval requirements are met. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain types of lawsuits, which could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us or our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.", "PERMNO": 13563, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "TTSH"}
