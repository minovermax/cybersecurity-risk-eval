Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry and our business and financial results. Forward-looking statements often include words such as \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201ccontinues,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cgoals\u201d and words and terms of similar substance in connection with discussions of future operating or financial performance. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Our actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf. Although we believe that the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nlack of operating history as an independent, publicly traded company and unreliability of historical combined financial information as an indicator of our future results\u037e\n\u2022\nthe level of competition from other companies\u037e\n\u2022\nability to successfully develop new technologies and introduce new products\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing global and regional economic conditions\u037e\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including, but not limited to cold weather, flooding, tornadoes and the physical impacts of climate change\u037e\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality\u037e\n\u2022\nability to operate as an independent publicly traded company without certain benefits available to us as a part of Honeywell\u037e\n\u2022\ndependence upon investment in information technology\u037e\n\u2022\nfailure or inability to comply with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or failures\u037e\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, other disruptions, or the need to relocate any of our facilities\u037e\n\u2022\neconomic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or government regulations or policies\u037e\n\u2022\nour growth strategy is dependent on expanding our distribution business\u037e\n\u2022\ninability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts\u037e\n\u2022\nthe significant failure or inability to comply with the specifications and manufacturing requirements of our OEM customers or by increases or decreases to the inventory levels maintained by our customers\u037e\n\u2022\ndifficulty collecting receivables\u037e\n\u2022\nthe failure to protect our intellectual property or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property of others\u037e\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain intellectual property agreements\u037e\n\u2022\nthe failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements\u037e\n\u2022\ninability to grow successfully through future acquisitions\u037e\n\u2022\ninability to recruit and retain qualified personnel\u037e\n\u2022\nthe operational constraints and financial distress of third parties\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of raw materials that we use to produce our products\u037e\n\u2022\nlabor disputes\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow funds and access capital markets\u037e\n\u2022\nthe amount of our obligations pursuant to the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\npotential material environmental liabilities\u037e\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\u2022\npotential material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims, including product recalls, and product liability actions that may be brought against us\u037e\n\u2022\npotential material litigation matters\u037e\n\u2022\nunforeseen U.S. federal income tax and foreign tax liabilities\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. federal income tax reform\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential suspension in the future of our dividend program\u037e and\n\u2022\ncertain factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThese and other factors are more fully discussed in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d sections and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. These risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K. Even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.\nAny forward-looking statements made by us in this Form 10-K speak only as of the date on which they are made. We are under no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks that we face. Some of the risks relate to our business, others to the Spin-Off. Some risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock.\nAny of the following risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K.\nThe following risk factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance and should not be considered to represent a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have limited operating history as an independent, publicly traded company, and our historical consolidated and combined financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived the historical combined financial information for periods prior to the Spin-Off included in this Form 10-K from Honeywell\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of Honeywell\u2019s broader corporate organization, and Honeywell performed various corporate functions for us. Our historical combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off reflects allocations of corporate expenses from Honeywell for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs it will incur for similar services in the future as an independent publicly traded company.\n\u2022\nWe have entered into transactions with Honeywell that did not exist prior to the Spin-Off, such as Honeywell\u2019s provision of transition and other services and brand licensing agreements, and have undertaken indemnification obligations, which will cause us to incur new costs. See Note 21. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\u2022\nOur historical combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off does not reflect changes that we have or expect to experience in the future as a result of our separation from Honeywell, including changes in the financing, cash management, operations, cost structure and personnel needs of our business. As part of Honeywell, we enjoyed certain benefits from Honeywell\u2019s operating diversity, size, purchasing power, borrowing leverage and available capital for investments. As an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services and technologies, such as computer software licenses, or access capital markets on terms as favorable to it as those obtained as part of Honeywell prior to the Spin-Off, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, our historical combined financial data does not include an allocation of interest expense comparable to the interest expense we will incur as a result of the Spin-Off, including interest expense in connection with the incurrence of indebtedness at our Company.\nFurthermore, while the individualized businesses or their predecessors have a history of product development going back over 100 years, we have a limited operating history with a residential Comfort, RTS, Security, or home solutions business focus, or in combination with a distribution business, and we may not be successful in continuing to operate and grow our business with a narrower focus and outside the broader Honeywell operating environment. We may face operational inefficiencies as we continue to integrate our business after the Spin-Off. We are responsible for the additional costs and demands on management\u2019s time associated with being an independent, publicly traded company, including costs and demands related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. In addition, while we have been profitable as part of Honeywell, we cannot assure you that our profits will continue at a similar level when we are an independent, publicly traded company. For additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, see \u201cSelected Financial Data,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our historical Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, and the Notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and compete directly with global, national, regional and local providers of our products, services and solutions including manufacturers, distributors, service providers, retailers and online commerce providers. The most significant competitive factors we face are product and service innovation, reputation of our Company and brands, sales and marketing programs, product performance, quality of product training and events, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, service and price, technical support, furnishing of customer credit and product reliability and warranty, with the relative importance of these factors varying among our segments and products. In addition to current competitive factors, there may be new market entrants with non-traditional business and customer service models or disruptive technologies and products, resulting in increased competition and changing business dynamics. See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business-The market for connected home solutions is fragmented, highly competitive, continually evolving and subject to disruptive technologies.\u201d Existing or future competitors may seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, and we may be required to lower prices or may lose business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, to the extent that we do not meet changing customer preferences or demands or other market changes, or if one or more of our competitors introduces new products, becomes more successful with private label products, online offerings or establishes exclusive supply relationships, our ability to attract and retain customers could be adversely affected.\nWe also have long-standing relationships with customers whose business models may be subject to the risks articulated above. For example, changes in the security system market, such as a shift away from subscription monitoring services, could adversely impact certain of our large customers or cause them to change their business models in ways that adversely impact our business and cash flows. As new market entrants emerge there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in developing customer relationships with them, or that such relationships will be as mutually beneficial as our current relationships. Furthermore, if new technologies or business models become ascendant in our customers\u2019 markets our relationships and service commitments with incumbent businesses may become a disadvantage.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nTo remain competitive, we will need to invest continually in product development, marketing, customer service and support, manufacturing and our distribution networks. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position. In addition, we anticipate that we may have to reduce the prices of some of our products or solutions to stay competitive, potentially resulting in a reduction in the profit margin for, and inventory valuation of, these products. It is possible that competitive pressures resulting from consolidation, including customers taking manufacturing or distribution in house, moving to a competitor and consolidation among our customers, could affect our growth and profit margins. In addition, competitors in certain high growth regions may have lower costs than we do due to lower local labor costs and favorable government regulation. Countries in high growth regions may have differing codes and standards impacting the cost of doing business and may have fewer protections for, or offer less ability to utilize, existing intellectual property. We may not be able to compete effectively with new competitors from such regions. Existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price for, and reducing the number of, suitable acquisitions.\nOur competitors may have more substantial resources than we do.\nOur current and potential competitors may have greater resources, access to capital, including greater research and development or sales and marketing funds, more customers, and more advanced technology platforms, particularly with our newly-launched products and services in connected services and in our newer geographic regions. Many of our competitors may be able to develop offerings that have alternate income streams such as data and advertising revenue which we may not have, and therefore may be able to offer their service products for a lower price or for free and offset any business losses with profits from the rest of their broad product portfolios. Some of our competitors may also be able to deliver their service solutions more quickly to market than we can by capitalizing on technology developed in connection with their substantial existing service models. In addition, some of our competitors have significant bases of customer adoption in other services and in online content, which they could use as a competitive advantage in the growing connected home solutions services market or otherwise in our product or distribution businesses. New entrants into the wholesale distribution business or products business could include companies with significant presence in residential environments and could put us at a competitive disadvantage if they enter the market. Current and future competitive pressures may cause us to reduce our prices or lose market share, or could negatively affect our cash flow, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe market for connected home solutions is fragmented, highly competitive, continually evolving and subject to disruptive technologies.\nThe market for connected home solutions is fragmented, highly competitive, continually evolving and subject to disruptive technologies. Cable and telecommunications companies actively focusing on competing in connected home solutions and expanding into the monitored security space, and large technology companies expanding into connected home solutions, could result in pricing pressure, a shift in customer preferences towards the services of these companies and a reduction in our market share. Many of these companies already have significant presence in residential environments and may be able to leverage this presence into the connected home solution. New market entrants with non-traditional business and customer service models or disruptive technologies and products could result in increased competition and changing business dynamics. Continued pricing pressure from these competitors or other new entrants, failure to successfully partner with these companies or failure to achieve pricing based on competitive advantages could prevent us from maintaining competitive price points for our products and services resulting in loss of customers or in our inability to attract new customers and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Based on these or other factors described herein, we may not be able to grow our connected home solutions business as anticipated.\nCompetition in the distribution business is significant.\nIf end customers of our distribution business are not convinced of the reputation of our Company and brands and of our ability to compete on product performance, quality of product training and events, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, service and price, technical support, credit availability and product reliability and warranty, we could lose business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Furthermore, if retail outlets, including online\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\ncommerce or big box stores were to increase their participation in wholesale distribution markets, or if buying patterns for our products become more retail or e-commerce based through these outlets, we may not be able to effectively compete, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, other sources of competition are buying groups that consolidate purchasing power, which if successful could have an adverse effect of our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The security industry is also undergoing consolidation as many residential and commercially-focused companies combine to leverage product and vertical market expertise and expand their service footprint. In recent years, this trend of consolidation has accelerated, and many of our customers have combined with companies with whom we have little or no prior relationship. In addition, if manufacturers of products sold through our distribution business increase their direct-to-customer or retail distribution, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGrowth of the retail market and e-commerce market could adversely affect our business.\nOur solutions are primarily sold through a network of professional contractors, distributors, OEMs, retailers and online merchants. Growth of the retail market, including the self-installed or do-it-yourself retail markets and e-commerce markets could affect our business by attracting new competitors, some of whom may be larger and have more resources than we do. In addition, growth of these retail markets relative to the professional installation markets may negatively impact our margins, which could negatively affect our cash flow and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnology in our markets is changing rapidly and our future results and growth are largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance.\nTechnology in our markets is in a continuing and often rapid state of change as new technologies and enhancements to existing technologies continue to be introduced both in our traditional and connected product markets. There is increasing customer demand for connected home solutions and the development of new technologies as well as increasing emphasis on product efficiency in our traditional products. Our future results depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, in part by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iii) grow our market share, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, (v) find and effectively partner with and continue to partner with home connected device platforms and (vi) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers\u2019 needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.\nWe can offer no assurance that we will be able to keep pace with technological developments. It is also possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant technical advantage or breakthrough that allows them to provide additional or superior products or services, or to lower their price for similar products or services, that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our inability to predict the growth of and respond in a timely way to customer preferences and other developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customer service model has historically been based largely around individualized product support, primarily through telephone communications. Although this allows a high degree of personalized and interactive dialogue, it differs from the highly-scalable and rapid electronic response systems pioneered by technology companies that operate in or may enter our markets. As such, we may be disadvantaged in terms of cost and overall customer satisfaction if we are unable to successfully adapt our support model to changes in customer expectations for our products.\nOur connected solutions platform allows for integration and connection to third party solutions and for application designs. This interoperability is designed to reduce the barriers to using our software and panels with different devices, but could also have the effect of encouraging competitors to produce devices that operate on our platform, which could lower sales of our products. Adoption rates of our connected home solutions will also depend on a number of factors, including development of competitive and attractive products and the cost to customers of installation of new solutions or upgrade or renovation from older connected platforms or products. In addition to our application products, we rely on third party designers to create applications connecting our products to other platforms. If developers choose not to develop on our system, the accessibility of our solutions across other systems, devices and platforms might not expand in line with our competitors.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nIn addition, if we are unable to effectively protect our trade secreted or proprietary technology from third parties or other competitors that may have access to our technology through our open architecture model, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nWe expect that the growth of our business may depend on our development of new technologies in response to legislation and regulation related to efficiency standards, safety and security and environmental concerns. Agreement on legislation and regulation may be slow and implementation of any such reforms may take many years. As a result, any growth related to solutions that are responsive to such reforms may be delayed.\nOur connected solutions and other products and services rely on enabling technology, connectivity, software and intellectual property that in certain instances we do not own or control.\nOur operations depend upon third party technologies, software and intellectual property. Additionally, our connected solutions and our security monitoring services may be accessed through the Internet and using connectivity infrastructures (for example, 4G, LTE and next generation 5G and other wireless technologies) and cloud-based technologies. We rely on cellular and other telecommunications and network providers to communicate signals to and from customers using our connected solution applications in a timely, cost-efficient and consistent manner.\nThe failure of one or more of these providers or technologies to transmit and communicate signals in a timely manner could affect our ability to provide services to our customers or for our connected solution products to work as designed. There can be no assurance that third party telecommunications and network providers and signal-processing centers will continue to transmit and communicate signals to or from our third party providers and the monitoring stations without disruption. Any such disruption, particularly one of a prolonged duration, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, failure to renew contracts with existing providers or licensors of technology, software, intellectual property or connectivity solutions, or to contract with other providers or licensors on commercially acceptable terms or at all may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMarket and economic conditions may adversely affect the economic conditions of our customers, demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\nAs a global provider of Comfort, RTS and Security products, services and technologies for the home, as well as a worldwide wholesale distributor of security and low voltage electronics products, our business is affected by the performance of the global new and repair and remodel construction industry. Our markets are sensitive to changes in the regions in which we operate and are also influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, availability of financing, consumer spending habits and confidence, employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control and which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, downward changes in the housing market would be expected to depress sales to professional contractors and result in substantially all of our professional contractor and OEM customers lowering production schedules, which would have a direct impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sales are also affected by fluctuations in demand for Internet-connected devices. If the market for connected home solutions grows more slowly than anticipated, whether as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical environments, budgetary constraints of our consumers or other factors, we may not be able to increase our revenue and earnings.\nPortions of our revenue and cash flow are seasonal, which could cause our financial results and liquidity to fluctuate.\nA portion of our revenue is seasonal, which impacts the comparison of our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Sales activity is generally lowest during the first calendar quarter when it is winter in the majority of our geographical markets.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nGlobal climate change could negatively affect our business.\nResponses to climate change may cause a shift away from fossil fuels to alternative power sources. Many of our thermal solutions are designed for application with oil and gas systems. A shift away from fossil fuels could affect our OEM customers\u2019 business and result in a loss of business for them and for us. If we fail to adapt our solutions to alternative power sources, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters may depress our sales. In addition, stable temperatures may result in less wear and tear on cooling and heating equipment which may depress Comfort and RTS sales. Demand for our products and our services, particularly our products and solutions geared toward the home construction repair and remodel industry, including our Comfort and RTS businesses, is seasonal and strongly affected by the weather. Cooler than normal summers depress our sales of replacement controls for heating, ventilation, cooling and water heating equipment in certain larger markets. Similarly, warmer than normal winters have the same effect on our heating products and services. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change have led to our development of social responsibility, sustainability and other business policies, which in some instances are more restrictive than current laws and regulations. In light of the current regulatory environment, we also face uncertainty with respect to future climate change initiatives, including regional and/or federal requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nMoreover, climate change itself creates financial risk to our business. Unseasonable weather conditions may impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and increase insurance and other operating costs and, especially in the case of disruptions at our ADI stores, our ability to make sales during the pendency of site closures. These factors may influence our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas that are prone to physical climate risks. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain, and process disruptions due to physical climate changes could result in price modifications for our products and the resources needed to produce them.\nWe could be adversely affected by any violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise securing an improper business advantage. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions in which we may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials. We face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, contractors or consultants. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective in preventing such unauthorized payments, and our employees and consultants may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could subject us and such persons to criminal and/or substantial civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and reputation.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe test, at least annually, the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, as discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included herein. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. Any such charges may have a material negative impact on our operating results. There were no impairment charges taken during the years ended 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our results.\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in our Company and our brand image. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers\u2019 expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement action. In addition, in the event that any of our products fail to perform as expected, we may face direct exposure to warranty and product liability claims or may be required to participate in a government or self-imposed recall involving such products which could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. As a result, our reputation as a manufacturer and distributor of high quality products and services could suffer and impact customer loyalty.\nWe maintain strict quality controls and procedures, including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products. However, we cannot be certain that our testing will reveal latent defects in our products or the materials from which they are made, which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market. We also cannot be certain that our suppliers will always eliminate latent defects in products we purchase from them. Accordingly, there is a risk that product defects will occur, which could require a product recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement, and, if a product recall occurs during the product\u2019s warranty period, we may be required to replace the defective product. In addition, a product recall may damage our relationship with our customers and we may lose market share with our customers.\nIn many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any such claims or contribution requests exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines, which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. There can be no assurance that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recalls, repair and replacement costs. Our customers that are not end-users of our products, including our OEM customers, may face similar claims or be obliged to conduct recalls of their own, which could result in lost business to us, or these customers may seek contribution from us for defects.\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, we may not enjoy the same benefits that we did as a segment of Honeywell.\nWe are a smaller and less diversified company than Honeywell, and do not have access to financial and other resources comparable to those of Honeywell prior to the Spin-Off. As a stand-alone company, we do not have the same product diversity or scale and may not have similar purchasing power or access to capital markets, and we may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the Spin-Off, which could decrease our overall profitability. Uncertainty related to the Spin-Off may lead customers and other parties with whom we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships, or cause them to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us.\nOur business is dependent upon substantial investment in information technology.\nThe efficient operation of our business requires substantial investment in technology infrastructure systems, including enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems, supply chain management systems, digital commerce systems and connected solutions platforms. The inability to fund, acquire and implement these systems may impact our ability to respond effectively to changing customer expectations, manage our business, scale our solutions effectively or impact our customer service levels, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our financial results. Repeated or prolonged interruptions of service, due to problems with our systems or third party technologies, whether or not in our control, could have a significant negative impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nWe are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business. In order to support our continued operational ability and growth, we must maintain and continuously upgrade our ERP and other information systems, which are critical to our operational, accounting and financial functions. Failure to properly or adequately invest in and maintain these systems could result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to efficiently manage our business. Our existing information systems may become obsolete, requiring us to transition our systems to a new platform. Such a transition would be time consuming and costly, and would require management resources in excess of those we currently have.\nFurther, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe must attract and retain qualified people to operate our systems, expand and improve them, integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs, and convert to new systems efficiently when required. Any disruption to our business due to such issues, or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated, could have an adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers rely increasingly on our electronic ordering and information systems as a source for product information, including availability and pricing. There can be no assurance that our systems will not fail or experience disruptions, and any significant failure or disruption of these systems could prevent us from making sales, ordering and delivering products and otherwise conducting our business. Many of our customers use our website to check real-time product availability, see their customized pricing and place orders, and to access our connected solution platforms. Any material disruption of our website, our connected solution applications, or the Internet in general could impair our order processing or prevent our manufacturers and customers from accessing information and cause us to lose business or damage our reputation.\nRisks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws and regulations and associated compliance efforts, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on the processing of data (some of which contains personal data), including the transfer of data between our affiliated entities, to and from our business partners and customers, and with third-party service providers. The laws and regulations relating to personal data constantly evolve, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new measures addressing data privacy and processing (including collection, storage, transfer, disposal and use) of personal data. Moreover, the interpretation and application of many existing or recently enacted privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the European Union, the U.S. and elsewhere are uncertain and fluid, and it is possible that such laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products and services. Any such new laws or regulations, any changes to existing laws and regulations and any such interpretation or application may affect demand for our products and services, impact our ability to effectively transfer data across borders in support of our business operations, or increase the cost of providing our products and services. Additionally, any actual or perceived breach of such laws or regulations may subject us to claims and may lead to administrative, civil or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to us or our employees. We could also be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices, or modify our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the U.S., various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, transfer, disposal, unauthorized disclosure and security of personal data. For example, data protection laws passed by most states within the U.S. require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, transfer and security of personal data. In particular, our privacy policy and other statements we publish provide promises and assurances about privacy and security that could subject us to potential regulatory action or other liabilities if such statements are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our privacy and data security practices. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures, along with federal regulatory authorities have recently increased their attention to matters concerning personal data, and this may result in new legislation which could increase the cost of compliance.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nIn California, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which comes into effect in 2020, grants California residents new data privacy rights and regulates the security of connected devices.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us or our customers.\nIn the European Union, some of our operations are subject to the European Union\u2019s GDPR, which took effect from May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduced a number of new obligations for subject companies and we will need to continue dedicating financial resources and management time to GDPR compliance in the future. The GDPR enhances the obligations placed on companies that control or process personal data of residents of the European Union including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is to be used, the mandatory obligation to provide fair processing notices at the time when personal data is obtained, new mechanisms for obtaining consent from data subjects, new controls for data subjects with respect to their personal data (including by enabling them to exercise rights to erasure, right to restrict processing of personal data, and data portability), limitations on retention of personal data and mandatory data breach notifications. Additionally, the GDPR places companies under new obligations relating to data transfers and the security of the personal data they process, as well as in relation to third-party data processors they use. The GDPR provides that supervisory authorities in the European Union may impose administrative fines for certain infringements of the GDPR of up to EUR 20,000,000 or 4% of a company\u2019s total, worldwide, annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Individuals who have suffered damage as a result of a subject company\u2019s non-compliance with the GDPR also have the right to seek compensation from such company. Given the breadth of the GDPR, compliance with its requirements is likely to continue to require significant expenditure of resources on an ongoing basis, and there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken for the purposes of compliance will be successful in preventing breach of the GDPR. Given the potential fines, liabilities and damage to our reputation in the event of an actual or perceived breach of the GDPR, such a breach may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOutside of the U.S. and the European Union, many jurisdictions have adopted or are adopting new data privacy laws that may impose further onerous compliance requirements, such as data localization, which prohibits companies from storing outside the jurisdiction data relating to resident individuals. The proliferation of such laws within the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in conflicting and contradictory requirements, particularly in relation to evolving technologies. Any failure to successfully navigate the changing regulatory landscape could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrivacy-related claims or lawsuits initiated by governmental bodies, customers or other third parties, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly regulatory proceedings, litigation, penalties and fines, or require us to change our business practices, sometimes in expensive ways, or other potential liabilities. Unfavorable publicity regarding our privacy practices could injure our reputation, harm our ability to keep existing customers or attract new customers or otherwise adversely affect our business, assets, revenue, brands and reputation which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCyber or other security incidents, could disrupt our internal systems causing service failures, disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our connected products potentially expose our business to cybersecurity threats.\nWe create, deploy and maintain information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and engineering systems, some of which involve sensitive information, including personal data, trade secrets and other proprietary information. In addition, our connected products potentially expose our business to cybersecurity threats. As a result, we are subject to systems, service or product failures, not only resulting from our own failures or the failures of third party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, but also from exposure to cyber or other security threats. Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data security and protection of information. See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business-Risks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws and regulations and associated compliance efforts, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d We are taking proactive measures to help assess our cybersecurity capabilities being provided under the TSA by Honeywell and establish a risk prioritized strategic roadmap in support of implementing our own independent capabilities to provide a broad cybersecurity operating model. Additionally, we have certain measures to protect our information systems and products against unauthorized access and disclosure of personal information and of our confidential information and trade secrets and confidential information and trade secrets belonging to our customers. However, there is no assurance that the security measures we have put in place will be effective in every case.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT, payment and other systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at us, our products, our customers, vendors and/or our third party service providers, including cloud providers and Honeywell arising out of its provision of IT services under the TSA, which extends through April 2020. There has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cyber and other security threats we face, and our customers are increasingly requiring cyber and other security protections and standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents.\nWe sell security and life safety solutions, which are designed to secure the safety of our subscribers and their residences or commercial properties. If these solutions fail for any reason, including due to defects in our software, a carrier outage, a failure of our network operating center, a failure on the part of one of our service provider partners, user error or cybersecurity incident, we could be subject to liability and reputational damage for such failures and our business could suffer.\nWe seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, security and operational monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cyber and other security incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption, misuse or unavailability of personal data, company assets, critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties), product failure and the disruption of business operations. Moreover, employee error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other intentional or inadvertent non-compliance with our security protocols and policies subject us to breaches of our information systems. Our efforts to protect our company data and the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software \u201cbugs,\u201d system errors or other technical deficiencies, or vulnerabilities of our vendors and service providers. Cyber and other security incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products.\nThe potential consequences of a material cyber or other security incident include financial loss, reputational damage, negative media coverage, litigation with third parties, including class-action litigation, regulatory investigations or actions, theft of intellectual property, fines, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cyber and other security protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to any costs resulting from contract performance or required corrective action, these incidents could generate increased costs or loss of revenue if our customers choose to postpone or cancel previously scheduled orders or decide not to renew any of our existing\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\ncontracts. Breaches in security could also result in a negative impact for our customers and thus affect our relations with our customers, injure our reputation and harm our ability to keep existing customers and to attract new customers. Some jurisdictions have enacted law requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. Such mandatory disclosures could lead to negative publicity and may cause our current and prospective customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures.\nWe have cybersecurity insurance (subject to specified retentions or deductibles) related to a breach event covering expenses for items such as notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. We also maintain product liability insurance (subject to specified retentions or deductibles) that may cover certain physical damage or third-party injuries caused by potential cybersecurity incidents associated with our products. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available.\nWe could incur significant costs in protecting our data centers, servers, applications, and cloud environments against, or remediating, security vulnerabilities or breaches and cyber-attacks. Additionally, the costs related to cyber or other security incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The successful assertion of a large claim against us with respect to a cyber or other security incident could seriously harm our business. Even if not successful, these claims could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to our management and harm our customer relationships and reputation.\nThe failure of our network operations centers and data backup systems could put our users at risk.\nMany of our solutions operate with a hosted architecture, and we update our solutions regularly while our solutions are operating. If our solutions and/or upgrades fail to operate properly, our solutions could stop functioning for a period of time, which could put our users at risk. Our ability to keep our business operating is highly dependent on the proper and efficient operation of our network operations centers and data backup systems. Although our network operations centers have back-up computer and power systems, if there is a catastrophic event, adverse weather conditions, natural disaster, terrorist attack, security breach or other extraordinary event, we may be unable to provide our subscribers with uninterrupted monitoring service. Furthermore, because data backup systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions (including those due to equipment damage, power outages, human error, computer viruses, computer hacking, data corruption and a range of other hardware, software and network problems), we cannot guarantee that we will not experience data backup failures in the future. A significant or large-scale, security breach, malfunction or interruption of our network operations centers or data backup systems could adversely affect our ability to keep our operations running efficiently. If a malfunction or security breach results in a wider or sustained disruption, it could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business-Internal system or service failures, including as a result of cyber or other security incidents, could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our connected products potentially expose our business to cybersecurity threats.\u201d\nDisruptions, or the need to relocate any of our facilities, could significantly disrupt our business.\nWe manufacture many of products at single-location production facilities and rely on certain suppliers who also may concentrate production in single locations. A disruption, including work stoppage, supply chain failures, natural disasters, weather-related disruptions, or other disruptions at one or more of our production facilities could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, due to unforeseen circumstances or factors beyond our control, we may be forced to relocate our operations from one or more of our existing facilities to new facilities and may incur substantial costs, experience program delays and sacrifice proximity to customers and geographic markets as a result, potentially for an extended period of time. Any significant interruption in production at one or more of these facilities could negatively impact our ability to deliver our products to our customers.\nA significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage or other disruption at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could impact our ability to make timely deliveries to our customers and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Where a manufacturer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time, or as a result of a work stoppage or other disruption, it is unlikely we will be fully compensated, if at all.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nWe rely on certain suppliers of materials and components for our products.\nCertain of the materials and components for products we manufacture and those manufactured on our behalf are supplied by single or limited source suppliers. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by disruptions in supply from our third party suppliers, whether from supply chain disruptions or if suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition or otherwise. See \u201cBusiness-Materials and Suppliers.\u201d\nIf our third party suppliers and manufacturers fail to deliver materials, products, parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders or stocking our distribution centers on similar terms or at all, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead-time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.\nCertain of our suppliers provide us with cloud based services which we rely on to support our products and solutions and serve our customers and consumers. These types of relationships with cloud based service providers are expected to increase over time. If their services fail, the operation and maintenance of our products and solutions, installed based as well as new sales, may be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness and operational reliability of existing or future suppliers, if there is any unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and operational reliability, or if our suppliers do not perform or adhere to our existing or future contractual arrangements, any resulting inability to otherwise obtain the supplies or our inability to enforce the terms of the contract or seek other remedies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nWe obtain many of the products for our ADI distribution business from third parties.\nMost of the low voltage products we distribute through our ADI business are manufactured by third parties. As a result, terminations of supply or services agreements or a change in terms or conditions of sale from one or more of our key manufacturers could negatively affect our operating margins, net revenue or the level of capital required to fund our operations. We have standard distribution contracts with our manufacturers which are subject to renegotiation or non-renewal. Our dependence on third party manufacturers leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of demanded products, price increases, late deliveries and poor product quality.\nOur ability to obtain particular products or product lines in the required quantities and our ability to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success. Our manufacturers have experienced product supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain of their suppliers to supply certain products on a timely basis. As a result, we have experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, short-term shortages of specific products. We cannot provide any assurances that manufacturers will be able to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill all of our customer orders on a timely basis. Our reputation, sales and profitability may suffer if manufacturers are not able to provide us with an adequate supply of products to fulfill our customer orders on a timely basis or if we cannot otherwise obtain particular products or a product lines.\nManufacturers who currently distribute their products through us may decide to shift to or substantially increase their existing distribution with other distributors, their own dealer networks, or directly to resellers or end-users. Increasingly, our manufacturers are combining, leaving us with fewer alternative sources. This could result in more intense competition as distributors strive to secure distribution rights with these manufacturers, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of products, or if manufacturers do not regularly invest in, introduce to us, and/or make new products available to us for distribution, our net revenue and gross profit could suffer considerably.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nThe cost and availability of raw materials (such as copper, steel, aluminum, plastics, printed circuit boards, semiconductors and passive electronics) is a key factor in the cost of our products. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, effects of economic, political or financial market conditions on a supplier\u2019s operations, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions, information system disruptions or other reasons beyond our control.\nThe profitability of our business is also dependent upon the efficiency of our supply chain. An inefficient or ineffective supply chain strategy or operations could increase operational costs, reduce profit margins and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Short- or long-term capacity constraints or financial distress at any point in our supply chain could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial performance, particularly when the affected suppliers and manufacturers are the sole sources of products that we require or that have unique capabilities, or when our customers have directed us to use those specific suppliers and manufacturers. We incur significant freight expenses related to the purchase of products for distribution and fluctuations in fuel costs may cause us to incur additional expense.\nWe are subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.\nOur international revenues are approximately 32% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our international geographic footprint subjects us to many risks including: exchange control regulations\u037e wage and price controls\u037e antitrust/competition and environmental regulations\u037e employment regulations\u037e foreign investment laws\u037e monetary and fiscal policies and protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, establish local content requirements, or impact trade volumes\u037e import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes)\u037e violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks)\u037e changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises\u037e nationalization of private enterprises\u037e natural and man-made disasters, hazards and losses\u037e backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our repositioning or restructuring actions\u037e violence, civil and labor unrest\u037e acts of terrorism\u037e and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. For more information on our international footprint, see \u201cItem 2. Properties.\u201d Additionally, certain of the markets in which we operate have adopted increasingly strict data privacy and data protection requirements or may require local storage and processing of data or similar requirements. See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business -Risks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws and regulations and associated compliance efforts, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d\nInstabilities and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment can negatively impact our business. The U.K.\u2019s referendum to leave the European Union, commonly known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has caused and may continue to cause interest rate, exchange rate and other market and economic volatility. As negotiations relating to the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union proceed, our manufacturing operations and the businesses of our customers and suppliers could be negatively impacted if tariffs, new compliance requirements or other restrictions (such as embargoes) are imposed on the free flow of goods to and from the U.K. In the event that the U.K. leaves the European Union with no agreement, there may be further and unanticipated adverse effects to global economic conditions that would likely have an adverse impact on labor costs, trade and foreign exchange risk. Similarly, the implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or other countries where we sell or manufacture large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products could negatively impact our business results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, a government\u2019s adoption of \u201cbuy national\u201d policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, such as tariffs or quotas, could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nTariffs, sanctions and other barriers to trade could adversely affect the business of our customers and suppliers, which could in turn negatively impact our net revenue and results of operations. In addition, a substantial volume of our Comfort and RTS products benefit from the favorable tariff rates established under the North American Free Trade Agreement, replacement of which, the newly negotiated U.S. Mexico Canada Trade Agreement, requires passage by three countries legislative branches to ensure continuation of significant trade benefits. These and other instabilities and uncertainties such as BREXIT arising from the global geopolitical environment, along with the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\nAs a result of our global presence, a portion of our net revenue are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, whereas a significant amount of our payment obligations, including pursuant to the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement and Tax Matters Agreement are denominated in U.S. Dollars, which exposes us to foreign exchange risk. We monitor and seek to reduce such risk through hedging activities\u037e however, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose us to financial loss.\nWe operate in many high-growth regions that require modifications to our products based on local building codes, regulations, standards, certifications and other factors, which may impact our cost to serve and profitability as we continue our penetration into these regions.\nWe operate in regulated markets.\nMany of our products, technologies and services, in particular products implicating life safety, are subject to regulatory agency oversight, such as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Union\u2019s CE mark (\u201cCE\u201d), the European Community directive \u201cWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive\u201d (\u201cWEEE Directive\u201d), the regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d), the Gulf Mark standard for low voltage electric products required in Gulf Member States (\u201cG Mark\u201d), the EurAsian Conformity Mark for member countries of Customs Union (\u201cEAC\u201d), the China Compulsory Certification (\u201cCCC\u201d) and the Regulatory Compliance Mark for Australia which may contribute to our compliance expenses. Many state regulators, such as the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, also have an impact on our markets. For example, 23 states have specific mercury thermostat regulations which require business compliance due to decades of sales of thermostats containing mercury. Mandatory collection requirements, penalties and federal legislation can have an impact on the expense. It is also important that our products comply with various third party standards, such as those of UL.\nIn addition, the FCC recently repealed net neutrality rules. We do not yet know the impact it may have on our business. Interference with our services or higher charges to customers by broadband service providers for using our products and services could cause us to lose existing subscribers, impair our ability to attract new subscribers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, telecommunication service providers are subject to extensive regulation in the markets where we operate or may expand in the future. The FTC and the FCC have issued regulations that place restrictions on, among other things, unsolicited automated telephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems and the use of prerecorded or artificial voice messages. If our service provider partners were to take actions in violation of these regulations, such as telemarketing to individuals on the \u201cDo Not Call\u201d registry, we could be subject to fines, penalties, private actions or enforcement actions by government regulators. Although we have taken steps to insulate ourselves from any such wrongful conduct by our service provider partners and require our service provider partners to comply with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to liability as result of our service provider partners\u2019 conduct. Changes in the applicable laws, regulations and technology affecting telecommunication services could require us to change the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt our operations, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nSome local governments impose assessments, fines, penalties and limitations on either customers or companies for false alarms. Certain municipalities have adopted ordinances under which both permit and alarm dispatch fees are charged directly to companies. Service providers generally pass these charges on to customers but may not be able to collect if customers are unwilling or unable to pay them, and this may require the service provider to suspend or terminate service and as a result adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, our customers may elect to terminate or not renew services if assessments, fines, or penalties for false alarms become significant. If more local governments were to impose assessments, fines or penalties or requirements for response such as video verification, it could adversely affect our customer base, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe net revenue and margins of our business are directly impacted by government regulations, including safety, performance and product certification regulations, particularly those driven by customer demands and national approvals, as well as changes in trade agreements and environmental and energy efficiency standards. Growth within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive.\nPart of our growth strategy is dependent on expanding our distribution business.\nPart of our growth strategy is to expand our geographic footprint and to increase the types and number of products sold through ADI. Our ability to open new ADI locations in both existing and new markets could be affected by local regulations and the availability of suitable real estate. We may not be able to acquire from manufacturers certain product lines that we are interested in adding to our distribution business, and if we are able to add products, they may not result in sales as expected and may not be profitable. If we are unable to execute on any part of our growth strategy, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected by a significant failure or inability to comply with the specifications and manufacturing requirements of our OEM customers.\nWe generally have to qualify, and are required to maintain our status, as a supplier for each of our OEM customers. This is a lengthy process that involves the inspection and approval by a customer of our engineering, documentation, manufacturing and quality control procedures before that customer will place volume orders. If we are successful in qualifying, there is no assurance that any OEM will purchase products from us. Given the length of this qualification process, the risk that our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected by the loss of, or any reduction in orders by, any of our significant OEM customers is increased. Accordingly, the success of our business depends on OEMs continuing to outsource the manufacturing of critical products to us. It would be difficult to replace lost revenue resulting from the loss of, or the reduction, cancellation or delay in purchase orders by, any one of these customers, whether due to their decision to not continue to outsource all or a portion of their critical parts for their capital equipment, their giving market share to our competitors or otherwise. A significant failure or inability to comply with customer specifications and manufacturing requirements or delays or other problems with existing or new products (including program launch difficulties) could result in financial penalties, cancelled orders, increased costs, loss of sales, loss of customers or potential breaches of customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. We have in the past lost business from OEM customers who have taken the manufacturing of our products in-house or given market share to our competitors. If we are unable to replace revenue from lost OEM customers it could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to obtain additional business from OEMs the potential growth of our business results could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to retain or expand relationships with certain large customers.\nA number of our customers are large and contribute significantly to our net revenue and operating income. Consolidation or change of control, particularly among our OEM customers, or a decision by any one or more of our customers to outsource all or most manufacturing work to a single equipment manufacturer, may concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a smaller number of customers. By virtue of our largest customers\u2019 size and the significant portion of revenue that we derive from them, they are able to exert significant influence in the negotiation of our commercial agreements and the conduct of our business with them. Furthermore, there is significant consolidation of companies focused on security products, and we have had customers combine with companies with whom we have little or no prior relationship, putting us at risk of loss of sales. If we are unable to retain and expand our business with these large customers on favorable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nWe have credit exposure to our customers.\nAny adverse trends in our customers\u2019 businesses could cause us to suffer credit losses. As is customary in our markets, we extend credit to our customers. A portion of our customers are small contractors with inconsistent cash flow. As such, they rely on us to provide their businesses with credit and to carry specified inventory to support their operations. We may be unable to collect on receivables if our customers experience decreases in demand for their products and services, do not manage their businesses adequately, or otherwise become less able to pay due to adverse economic conditions or refinancing events. While we evaluate our customers\u2019 qualifications for credit and monitor our extensions of credit, these efforts cannot prevent all credit losses, and credit losses negatively impact our performance. In addition, for financial reporting purposes, we establish reserves based on our historical experience of credit losses. To the extent that our credit losses exceed those reserves, our financial performance will be negatively impacted beyond what is expected. If there is deterioration in the collectability of our receivables, or we fail to take other actions to adequately mitigate such credit risk, our earnings, cash flows and our ability to utilize receivable-based financing could deteriorate. In addition, if we are unable to extend credit to our customers, we may experience loss of certain contracts or business.\nExtending credit to international customers involves additional risks. It is often more difficult to evaluate credit of a customer or obtain credit protections in our international operations. Also, credit cycles and collection periods are typically longer in our international operations. We are also subject to credit risk associated with customer concentration. If one or more of our largest customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent, or otherwise were unable to pay for our products, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts that may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of these factors and other challenges in extending credit to international customers, we generally face greater credit risk from sales internationally compared to domestic sales.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we do business. We may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate registered or unregistered intellectual property in all countries in which we do business. Companies that license intellectual property we own or use, especially, the Honeywell brand, also may take actions that diminish the value of our intellectual property or harm our reputation.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of some business opportunities. As a result, we may be required to change our plans or acquire the necessary intellectual property rights, which could be costly. Furthermore, our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in emerging markets may be limited by legal or practical considerations that have not historically affected our business in markets with more established intellectual property protection systems.\nThe protection of our intellectual property may be expensive and time-consuming. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to maintain and protect our intellectual property will be adequate, or that third parties will not infringe, circumvent, misappropriate or violate our intellectual property. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, the value of our goods and services may be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any impairment of our intellectual property, including due to changes in U.S. or worldwide intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protection or enforcement measures, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us.\nAs we adopt new technology, we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights. Successful claims that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, be prohibited preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or require us to change our business practices to stop the infringing use, which could limit our ability to compete effectively. In addition, our customer agreements can require us to indemnify the customer for infringement. The time and expense of defending against these claims, whether meritorious or not, may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability and can be time-consuming and costly and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. Furthermore, the publicity we may receive as a result of infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our existing customer relationships and our ability to develop new business.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not experience any material intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.\nFailure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.\nOur profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning and other projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, workforce reductions, asset impairments, product line rationalizations and other cost-saving initiatives. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect and the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully acquire and integrate other products, technologies or businesses or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nWe actively evaluate acquisitions and strategic investments in products or technologies and businesses that could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. From time to time, we may enter into letters of intent with companies with which we are negotiating for potential acquisitions or investments, or as to which we are conducting due diligence. An investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. We may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues.\nIn connection with any acquisitions we complete, we may have difficulty integrating the acquired business, may not achieve the synergies or other benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur unanticipated expenses, write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired product or technology or business could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDue to the complex nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our employees and management who have significant industry expertise, including our engineering and design personnel and trained sales force. Our performance is also dependent on the development of additional personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, design, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel in our markets is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may not be able to obtain additional capital that we need in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, upgrade and improve our manufacturing capabilities, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing R&D activities, satisfy regulatory and environmental compliance obligations and national approvals requirements, satisfy obligations under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our solutions, the extent to which we invest in new technology and R&D projects and the status and timing of these developments. If our access to capital were to become constrained significantly, or if costs of capital increased significantly, due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing business conditions, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are responsible for obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements, and debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain financing or access the capital markets, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and our level of indebtedness could restrict our ability to fund future development and acquisition activities. Also, regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing, our agreements and obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement that address compliance with Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), may limit our ability to issue stock. See Note 21. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information. We believe that we have adequate capital resources to meet our projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, including payments to Honeywell under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement. However, we may need additional capital resources in the future and if we are unable to obtain sufficient resources for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. See \u201c-Risks Relating to the Spin-Off-We may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent, publicly traded company, and we may experience increased costs.\u201d\nWe are subject to risks associated with the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we will be required to make substantial cash payments to Honeywell, measured in substantial part by reference to estimates by Honeywell of certain of its liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement (as defined below), pursuant to which we have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of payments, which include amounts billed (\u201cpayments\u201d), with respect to certain environmental claims, remediation and hazardous exposure or toxic tort claims, in each case including consequential damages (the \u201cliabilities\u201d) in respect of specified properties contaminated through historical business operations, including the legal and other costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less 90% of Honeywell\u2019s net insurance receipts relating to such liabilities, and less 90% of the net proceeds received by Honeywell in connection with (i) affirmative claims relating to such liabilities, (ii) contributions by other parties relating to such liabilities and (iii) certain property sales (the \u201crecoveries\u201d). The amount payable by us in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year is subject to a cap of $140 million (exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum). Payments in respect of the liabilities arising in a given year will be made quarterly throughout such year on the basis of an estimate of the liabilities and\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nrecoveries provided by Honeywell. Following the end of any such year, Honeywell will provide us with a calculation of the amount of payments and the recoveries received. Subject to the aforementioned cap, if the amount of payments (net of recoveries) is greater than the previously provided estimate, we will pay Honeywell the amount of such difference (the \u201ctrue-up payment\u201d) and, if the amount of the previously provided estimate is greater than the amount of payments (net of recoveries), we will receive a credit in the amount of such difference that will be applied to future payments. If a true-up payment exceeds $30 million, such true-up payment will be made in equal installments, payable on a monthly basis following the date the true-up payment is due.\nFor example, if in any given year, Honeywell\u2019s estimated annual payments that are within the scope of the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement totaled $140 million, and if Honeywell\u2019s estimated associated recoveries totaled $20 million, then our quarterly payment obligations in respect of that year would be 90% of the net amount (or $108 million) divided by four, or $27 million. If, for such year, Honeywell\u2019s annual payments actually totaled $165 million, and if Honeywell\u2019s associated recoveries actually totaled $10 million, our additional true-up payment obligation in respect of that year would be 90% of the net amount (or $139.5 million) minus the sum of our quarterly payments, or $108 million, resulting in an aggregate payment in respect of such year of $31.5 million, which, because it exceeds $30 million, would be made in equal installments, payable on the true-up date and on a monthly basis following the date the true-up payment is due. However, if in any given year, Honeywell\u2019s estimated annual payments totaled $175 million, and the estimated associated recoveries totaled $5 million, then our quarterly payment obligations in respect of that year would be capped at $35 million even though 90% of the net amount (or $153 million) divided by four is higher at $38.25 million, resulting in an aggregate maximum payment for such year equal to the cap of $140 million (regardless of whether or not actual liabilities (net of recoveries) exceeded the previously provided estimates).\nHistorically, Honeywell\u2019s environmental claim and remediation payments in respect of the sites that are within the scope of the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, including any legal fees, were approximately $179 million, $200 million and $221 million, respectively, and Honeywell\u2019s associated receipts for insurance and amounts received by Honeywell in connection with affirmative claims, contributions and property sales for 2017 and 2016 were approximately $2 million and $10 million, respectively. There were no associated receipts for insurance and amounts received by Honeywell in connection with affirmative claims, contributions and property sales in 2018. At December 31, 2018 we have recorded a liability to Honeywell of approximately $616 million in relation to our environmental obligation to Honeywell under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement.\nIn the event that Honeywell completes a transfer to a third party in respect of a portion of the remediation liabilities that are within the scope of the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, we will be obligated to pay 90% of the amount paid or payable by Honeywell in connection with such liability transfer, less any applicable recoveries. Amounts payable in respect of liability transfers for any given year are paid in the year following the year in which they occur, at the time that the true-up payment is made. If the amounts payable in respect of a liability transfer, together with any true-up payment, exceeds $30 million, such amounts will be made in equal installments, payable on the true-up date and on a monthly basis following the date the true-up payment is due. While any amount in respect of a liability transfer is outstanding, the annual payment by us to Honeywell will be first allocated towards the liabilities described above relating to environmental claims, remediation, hazardous exposure and toxic tort claims arising outside of the scope of the liability transfer, and then towards the liability transfer payment. The amount payable by us in respect of (i) any such liability transfers and (ii) the liabilities described above relating to environmental claims, remediation, hazardous exposure and toxic tort claims arising in any given year, is subject to a cap of $140 million (exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum).\nThe scope of our current environmental remediation obligations subject to the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement relates to approximately 230 sites or groups of sites that are undergoing environmental remediation under U.S. federal or state law and agency oversight for contamination associated with Honeywell legacy business operations. The ongoing environmental remediation is designed to address contaminants at upland and sediment sites, which include, among others, metals, organic compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls, through a variety of methods, which include, among others, excavation, capping, in-situ stabilization, groundwater treatment and dredging. In addition, our obligations subject to the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement will include certain liability with respect to (i) hazardous exposure or toxic tort claims associated with the specified sites that arise after the Spin-Off, if any, (ii) currently unidentified releases of hazardous substances at or associated with the specified sites, (iii) other environmental claims associated with the specified sites and (iv) consequential damages.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nPayment amounts under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement will be deferred to the extent that the payment thereof would cause a specified event of default under certain indebtedness, including our principal credit agreement, or cause us to not be compliant with certain financial covenants in certain indebtedness, including our principal credit agreement on a pro forma basis, including the maximum total leverage ratio (ratio of debt to EBITDA, which excludes any amounts owed to Honeywell under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement), and the minimum interest coverage ratio. A 5% late payment fee will accrue on all amounts that are not otherwise entitled to be deferred under the terms of the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, without prejudice to any other rights that Honeywell may have for late payments. In each calendar quarter, our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock in such calendar quarter will be restricted until any amounts payable under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement in such quarter (including any deferred payment amounts) are paid to Honeywell and we will be required to use available restricted payment capacity under our debt agreements to make payments in respect of any such deferred amounts. Payment of deferred amounts and certain other amounts could cause the amount we are required to pay under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement in respect of liabilities arising in any given calendar year to exceed $140 million (exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum). All amounts payable under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement will be guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries that act as guarantors under our principal credit agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, we will also be subject to certain of the affirmative and negative covenants to which we are subject under our principal credit agreement. Further, pursuant to the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, our ability to (i) amend or replace our principal credit agreement, (ii) enter into another credit agreement and make amendments or waivers thereto, or (iii) enter into or amend or waive any provisions under other agreements, in each case, in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of Honeywell under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, will be subject to Honeywell\u2019s prior written consent. This consent right will significantly limit our ability to engage in many types of significant transactions on favorable terms (or at all), including, but not limited to, equity and debt financings, liability management transactions, refinancing transactions, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions. See the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Honeywell-Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement\u201d in the Form 10 for more information.\nThe Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement may have material adverse effects on our liquidity and cash flows and on our results of operations, regardless of whether we experience a decline in net revenue. The Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement may also require us to accrue significant long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, the amounts of which will be dependent on factors outside our control, including Honeywell\u2019s responsibility to manage and determine the outcomes of claims underlying the liabilities. This may have a significant negative impact on the calculation of key financial ratios and other metrics that are important to investors, rating agencies and securities analysts in evaluating our creditworthiness and the value of our securities. Accordingly, our access to capital to fund our operations may be materially adversely affected and the value of your investment in our company may decline. The Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement also includes other obligations that may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. See the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Honeywell-Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement\u201d in the Form 10 for more information.\nAlthough we will have access to information regarding these liabilities as we may reasonably request for certain purposes, as well as the ability to participate in periodic standing meetings with Honeywell\u2019s remediation management team responsible for management of the underlying claims, including outside litigation or environmental counsel if necessary, the payment obligations under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement relate to legal proceedings and remediation efforts that we will not control, and we accordingly do not expect to be able to make definitive decisions regarding settlements or other outcomes that could influence our potential related exposure.\nIndependent of our payments under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, we will have ongoing liability for certain environmental claims which are part of our going forward business. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these payments totaled $1 million.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nOur operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the investigation and cleanup of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may arise from hazardous substance releases and exposures. These liabilities arise out of our current and past operations and the operations and properties of predecessor companies (including off site waste disposal). We entered into the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell related to certain of Honeywell\u2019s environmental-related liabilities. See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business-We are subject to risks associated with the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we will be required to make substantial cash payments to Honeywell, measured in substantial part by reference to estimates by Honeywell of certain of its liabilities.\u201d\nWe are also subject to potentially material liabilities related to the compliance of our operations with the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign governments that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, if we are found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to substantial fines, criminal sanctions, trade restrictions, product recalls, public exposure and be required to install costly equipment or make operational changes to achieve compliance with such laws and regulations.\nIn addition, changes in laws, regulations or government enforcement of policies concerning the environment, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual contaminated sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques, could require us to incur additional currently unanticipated costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and issue guarantees of third party obligations. We are subject to various lawsuits, investigations and disputes arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we were required to make payments, such payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities and we may have to satisfy insurance retentions. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur effective tax rate will be affected by factors including changes in tax rules, and in the interpretation and application of those rules, in the countries in which we operate.\nOur future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of our future earnings which could\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nimpact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) to address base erosion and profit shifting, and the interpretation and application of comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December of 2017, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d), will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes. As noted under \u201c-Risks Relating to Our Business-We are subject to risks associated with the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we will be required to make substantial cash payments to Honeywell, measured by reference to estimates by Honeywell of certain of its liabilities.\u201d\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nThe TCJA made fundamental changes to the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations. Significant changes include the provision of an exemption for certain active foreign earnings (subject to a cap determined by reference to a specified return on tangible assets), a minimum tax on foreign earnings in excess of the cap, expansion of the current anti-deferral rules, and new measures to deter base erosion. The TCJA also introduced a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%, repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, expensing of certain capital investment, and limitation of the deduction for interest expense. Although the TCJA was generally effective January 1, 2018, U.S. GAAP required recognition of the tax effects of new legislation during the reporting period that includes the enactment date, which was December 22, 2017. The impact on the year ended December 31, 2018 was, and the impact on future years may be, material to our financial statements. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016-Tax Expense.\u201d We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business.\nWe may be required to make significant cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans.\nWe sponsored defined benefit pension plans under which certain eligible Company employees will earn pension benefits following the Spin-Off as if they remained employed by Honeywell. We have plans in several countries including the U.S. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006, which is generally applicable to U.S. defined benefit pension plans, generally requires that defined benefit pension plans maintain certain capitalization levels. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Our pension contributions may be material and could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. We plan to make pension contributions during 2019 and in future periods sufficient to satisfy funding requirements.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nCompletion of the Spin-Off was conditioned on Honeywell\u2019s receipt of separate written opinions from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and KPMG LLP to the effect that the Spin-Off should qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code.\nThe opinions do not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the Spin-Off. The opinions assume that the Spin-Off was completed according to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and rely on the facts as stated in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the other ancillary agreements, the Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10 and a number of other documents. In addition, the opinions are based on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by, Honeywell and us. The opinions cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect.\nThe opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. If the conclusions expressed in the opinions are challenged by the IRS, and if the IRS prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences of the Spin-Off could be materially less favorable. Honeywell did not as part of the Spin-Off request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Spin-Off.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nIf the Distribution were determined not to qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, then a U.S. Holder who received our common stock in the Spin-Off generally would be treated as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received. The distribution would be treated as: (1) a taxable dividend to the extent of the holder\u2019s pro rata share of Honeywell\u2019s current or accumulated earnings and profits\u037e (2) a reduction in the holder\u2019s basis (but not below zero) in Honeywell common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the holder\u2019s share of Honeywell\u2019s earnings and profits\u037e and (3) taxable gain from the exchange of Honeywell common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the holder\u2019s share of Honeywell\u2019s earnings and profits and its basis in its Honeywell common stock. See below and the section titled \u201cThe Spin-Off-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Spin-Off\u201d in the Form 10 for more information.\nWe agreed in the Tax Matters Agreement not to take actions that could affect Honeywell\u2019s tax treatment. The need to comply with these provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement could reduce our strategic and operating flexibility. If we fail to comply with them, or breach representations or covenants made in the Tax Matters Agreement or in connection with the receipt of the tax opinion, we could incur material indemnification obligations to Honeywell, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf one or more persons acquire a 50% or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Honeywell or Resideo, directly or indirectly (including through acquisitions of stock after the completion of the Transactions), as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-Off, then the Spin-Off would be taxable to Honeywell, but not to Honeywell stockholders. Current law generally creates a presumption that any direct or indirect acquisition of stock of Honeywell or Resideo within two years before or after the Spin-Off is part of a plan that includes the Spin-Off, although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption in certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature, and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. We have entered into covenants not to engage in specified transactions for two years after the Spin-Off without Honeywell\u2019s prior consent (which Honeywell may grant or withhold in its sole discretion), and have agreed to indemnify Honeywell for any costs that it may incur as a result of our failure to comply with those covenants. These obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions, such as a share repurchase program, that may maximize the value of our business, and may discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our shareholders may consider favorable, including limiting our ability to use our equity to raise capital or fund acquisitions. Any payments required under these obligations could be significant and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Honeywell-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in the Form 10 for more information.\nWe are subject to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nWe are subject to covenants in the Tax Matters Agreement and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355 of the Code and are intended to preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off. These covenants include certain restrictions on our activity for a period of two years following the Spin-Off, unless Honeywell gives its consent for us to take a restricted action, which Honeywell is permitted to grant or withhold at its sole discretion. These covenants and indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable. See the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Honeywell-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in the Form 10 for more information.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nThe transition to operating as an independent, publicly traded company following the Spin-Off has required significant amounts of our management\u2019s time and effort, which may divert management\u2019s attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent, publicly traded company, and we may experience increased costs after the Spin-Off.\nHoneywell currently provides certain transitional corporate services under agreements with us. A description of the material terms and conditions of such agreements with Honeywell can be found in the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d of our Company\u2019s Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10. These services do not include every service that we received from Honeywell while we were part of Honeywell, and Honeywell is only obligated to provide the transition services for limited periods described in the agreements. We rely on Honeywell to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under any transition services agreements and other agreements related to the Spin-Off, and if Honeywell does not satisfy such obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses.\nOur ability to position and market ourselves as a provider of connected home technology could be adversely affected by our loss of access to Honeywell\u2019s development platforms. If we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nAs we build our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems, we could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions, and our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we will be subject following the Spin-Off.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, we installed and implemented information technology infrastructure to support certain of our business functions, including payment systems, ERP systems, accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control, customer service, inventory control and distribution. Such transition must also comply with applicable personal data privacy laws. See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business-Risks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws and regulations and associated compliance efforts, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d If we are unable to transition effectively, we may incur temporary interruptions in business operations. Any delay in implementing, or operational interruptions suffered while implementing, our new information technology infrastructure could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, if we are unable to replicate or transition certain systems, our ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired. We are subject to reporting and other obligations under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Beginning with our second required Annual Report on Form 10-K, we intend to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d), which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Under the Sarbanes Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To comply with these requirements, we may need to upgrade our systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these, and other public-company reporting, requirements. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See \u201c-Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market.\u201d\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nWe incurred new indebtedness in connection with the Spin-Off, and our leverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we incurred indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,225 million in the form of senior secured term loans and senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used by the Company to (i) repay intercompany indebtedness to Honeywell or a subsidiary of Honeywell of approximately $1.2 billion, (ii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the senior notes offering and the senior credit facilities and (iii) for general corporate purposes. We also entered into a revolving credit facility to be used for our working capital and other cash needs in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million.\nWe are responsible for obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements. After the Spin-Off, our access to and cost of debt financing are different than it would have been as a part of Honeywell. Differences in access to and cost of debt financing may result in differences in the interest rate charged to us on financings, as well as the amount of indebtedness, types of financing structures and debt markets that may be available to us.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the Spin-Off, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as well as the risk factors set forth herein.\nThe terms of our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nThe terms of the indebtedness include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These may restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take some or all of the following actions:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock\u037e\n\u2022\npay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem capital stock\u037e\n\u2022\nmake investments or acquisitions\u037e\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets\u037e\n\u2022\ncreate liens\u037e\n\u2022\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers\u037e\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets\u037e\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates\u037e\n\u2022\nprepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness\u037e\n\u2022\nissue or sell stock of our subsidiaries\u037e and/or\n\u2022\nsignificantly change the nature of our business.\nOn October 25, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement, which provides for (i) a seven-year senior secured first-lien term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $475 million (the \u201cTerm B Facility\u201d)\u037e (ii) a five-year senior secured first-lien term A loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (the \u201cTerm A Facility\u201d and, together with the Term B Facility, the \u201cTerm Loan Facilities\u201d)\u037e and (iii) a five-year senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d). The Senior Credit Facilities currently use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nFurthermore, the lenders of this indebtedness may require that we pledge our assets as collateral as security for our repayment obligations or that we abide by certain financial or operational covenants. Our ability to comply with such covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A breach of any of these covenants, if applicable, could result in an event of default under the terms of this indebtedness. If an event of default occurred, the lenders would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt, and the event of default or acceleration could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments, and lenders could then proceed against any collateral. Any subsequent replacement of the agreements governing such indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. The occurrence and ramifications of an event of default could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, as a result of all of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy, unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThe commercial and credit environment may adversely affect our access to capital.\nOur ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or if there are other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. These conditions may adversely affect our ability to obtain targeted credit ratings.\nOur customers, prospective customers, suppliers or other companies with whom we conduct business may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them.\nSome of our customers, prospective customers, suppliers or other companies with whom we conduct business may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them. Any failure of parties to be satisfied with our financial stability could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have potential business conflicts of interest with Honeywell with respect to our past and ongoing relationships.\nConflicts of interest may arise with Honeywell in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\nlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Honeywell\u037e\n\u2022\nintellectual property matters\u037e\n\u2022\nemployee recruiting and retention\u037e and\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving our Company.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party\nCertain of our directors and employees may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their financial interests in Honeywell.\nBecause of their former positions with Honeywell, certain of our executive officers and directors, including the chairman of the Board, own equity interests in Honeywell. Continuing ownership of Honeywell shares and equity awards could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if our Company and Honeywell face decisions that could have implications for both our Company and Honeywell.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nNo market for our common stock existed prior to the Spin-Off and, as a result, our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThere was no public market for our common stock prior to the Spin-Off. Following the Spin-Off, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business\u037e\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies\u037e\n\u2022\ncompetition and industry capacity\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and other factors that affect earnings and cash flow\u037e\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness, our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our ability to obtain financing as needed\u037e\n\u2022\nour indemnification obligations to Honeywell\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel\u037e\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry\u037e\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles\u037e\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover, or positively cover, our common stock after the Spin-Off\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates\u037e\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies\u037e\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our Company and our industry\u037e\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance\u037e\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders\u037e and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nOur stock could sustain periods of low trading volume, which would amplify the effect of the above factors on our stock\u2019s price volatility.\nShould the market price of our shares drop significantly, stockholders may institute securities class action lawsuits against us. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board and may be limited by the terms of our indebtedness and the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement\u037e there is no guarantee we will initiate dividends, or that once initiated, that we will continue paying dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not intend to pay cash dividends. We currently expect to retain any future earnings to fund the operation and expansion of our business and payback debt obligations. The Board\u2019s decision regarding any future payment of dividends will depend on the consideration of many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, sufficiency of distributable reserves, opportunities to retain future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth, capital requirements, debt service obligations, obligations under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the Board deems relevant. Additionally, the terms of the indebtedness we incurred in connection with the Spin-Off, obligations under the Honeywell Reimbursement Agreement and other amounts owed to Honeywell under the Transition Services, Tax Matters, Employee Matters, Trademark License and Patent Cross-License Agreements, will limit our ability to pay cash dividends.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nStockholder\u2019s percentage ownership in our Company may be diluted in the future.\nA stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership our Company may be diluted in the future because of common stock-based equity awards that we have granted and expect to grant in the future to our directors, officers and other employees. Prior to completion of the Spin-Off, we approved the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan of Resideo Technologies, Inc. and its Affiliates, as may be amended from time to time (the \u201cStock Incentive Plan\u201d) for the benefit of certain of our current and future employees and other service providers, as well as an equity plan for our non-employee directors. In addition, we may issue equity as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments that we may make in the future or as necessary to finance our ongoing operations.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our Board may generally determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of the members of our Board in all events or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock. See the section titled \u201cDescription of Our Capital Stock\u201d in the Form 10 for more information.\nFrom time-to-time, we may opportunistically evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities, including acquisitions for which the consideration thereof may consist partially or entirely of newly-issued shares of our common stock and, therefore, such transactions, if consummated, would dilute the voting power and/or reduce the value of our common stock. We issued debt securities in connection with the Spin-Off that are be convertible into equity securities of our Company and therefore do not have a dilutive effect on our common stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in Resideo.\nCertain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include, among others, provisions that:\n\u2022\nprovide for staggered terms for directors on our board for a period following the Spin-Off\u037e\n\u2022\ndo not permit our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, in each case except as such rights may otherwise be provided to holders of preferred stock\u037e\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals\u037e\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders\u037e and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to enter into business combination transactions.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of our Company, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price. See the section titled \u201cDescription of Our Capital Stock\u201d in the Form 10 for more information.\nRESIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the courts of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee or stockholder of our Company to the Company or our Company\u2019s stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporate Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any other action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the action may be brought in any other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. During 2019, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, with auditor attestation of the effectiveness of our internal controls, beginning with our second required annual report on Form 10-K. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of shares of common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section 404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer, and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our auditors as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, we cannot be certain that these measures would ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Even if we were to conclude, and our auditors were to concur, that our internal control over financial reporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our shares of common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. See \u201c-Risks Relating to the Spin-Off-As we build our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems, we could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions, and our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject following the Spin-Off.\u201d", "PERMNO": 18142, "SIC": 5065, "TIC": "REZI"}
