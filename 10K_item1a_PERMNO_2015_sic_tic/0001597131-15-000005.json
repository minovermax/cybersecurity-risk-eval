{"cik": "1597131", "company": "Glori Energy Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Relating to our Business\nOur business is difficult to evaluate due to its limited operating history.\nSince our inception in November 2005, the majority of our resources have been dedicated to our research development and testing efforts, and we have only recently begun to transition into the early stages of (i) commercializing the AERO System and (ii) acquiring, restoring and operating mature oil fields that fit our criteria for the AERO System. In addition, we do not have a stable operating history that you can rely on in connection with your evaluation of our current business and future business prospects. Our business and prospects must be carefully considered in light of the limited history of the AERO System and our acquisition of mature oil fields, and the many business risks, uncertainties and difficulties that are typically encountered by companies that have uncertain revenues and are committed to focusing on research, development and technology testing for an indeterminate period of time.\nOur proposed business strategies described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporate our management\u2019s current analysis of potential markets, opportunities and difficulties that we face.\nWe cannot assure you that our underlying assumptions accurately reflect current trends and conditions in our industry that the AERO System will be successful or that we will be able to profitably operate any oil fields that we acquire. Our business strategies may change substantially from time to time or may be abandoned as our management reassesses opportunities and reallocates resources. If we are unable to develop or implement these strategies, or if the AERO System becomes not economically viable, we may never achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we cannot predict the level of such profitability, and it may not be sustainable.\nWe have incurred substantial losses to date, may continue to incur losses in the future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since inception, including net losses of $11.9 million, $10.6 million and $18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively, and these losses may continue. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $64.1million. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business, including our research and development operations, the commercialization of the AERO System and the acquisition, restoration and operation of additional mature oil fields. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on our success in increasing industry acceptance of the AERO System and the completion and successful integration of oil property acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will achieve profitability.\nThe AERO System has only been applied to a limited number of reservoirs, and the viability of the AERO System in a broader range of reservoirs is still uncertain.\nOur AERO System has only been applied in a limited number of sandstone reservoirs to date. The future success of our business depends on our ability (i) to demonstrate that the AERO System has the ability to increase oil recovery on a more widespread basis, on a larger scale and on attractive economic terms and (ii) to profitably restore and operate any oil fields we may acquire. Reservoir characteristics differ and, consequently, certain elements of our services are specifically engineered for each reservoir. As a result, we may not be able to achieve results in other reservoirs consistent with those we have thus far achieved in the reservoirs where the AERO System has successfully been applied. For example, as discussed in detail below, in 2010, we acquired a non-producing oil field in Kansas known as the North Etzold field, which was to be used primarily as a field laboratory for the AERO System. The North Etzold field consisted of 14 shut-in wells which had been stripped of wellbore tubulars, artificial lift equipment and the associated oil and water processing and storage facilities. While the Phase 1 Recompletion resulted in a 45% increase in the daily production rate from the primary production well after implementation of the AERO System, the Phase 2 Recompletion, which was done simultaneously with the implementation of the AERO System, did not result in oil production sufficient to cover the direct production costs. Consequently, implementation of the AERO System could yield less favorable oil production rates and overall oil recovery results than those thus far achieved where the AERO System has successfully been applied.\nThe AERO System may not be commercially viable in marginally producing wells if the base and incremental production does not support the cost of operating such wells. Accordingly, the incremental oil associated with implementation of the AERO System will also continue only as long as oil can continue to be produced economically. Any inability to broaden our customer base and increase commercialization of the AERO System applications effectively or to realize sufficiently favorable oil recovery results in a significant number of other reservoirs, including those we may acquire, will limit the commercial acceptance and viability of the AERO System, which would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of the AERO System is dependent upon the information we receive.\nThe success of an application of the AERO System to a particular reservoir is dependent upon information that we receive regarding the reservoir characteristics and geology. If this information is inaccurate, we may not be able to achieve results in such a reservoir consistent with those we have thus far achieved in the reservoirs where the AERO System has been applied successfully. With respect to our customers, because of the uniqueness of our technology and the early stage of its development, we must educate potential customers on our technology in order to be able to generate business. New customers generally prefer to initially test our technology in a small portion of their lowest-priority oil field.\nSince our test only includes a small portion of the injection wells and production wells in the oil field, it is important that the customer be able to identify which injection wells are servicing the production wells in the test area. For example, on a recent project one of the customer\u2019s production wells was subsequently determined to be outside of the sand-body structure, and therefore not directly connected to the reservoir, so any waterflooding or application of the AERO System could not be effective for that production well since water could not flow from the injection well to the production well.\nWe may have difficulties gaining market acceptance and successfully marketing the AERO System to our potential customers.\nA primary component of our business strategy is to market the AERO System to oil producers. To gain market acceptance and successfully market the AERO System to oil producers, we must effectively demonstrate the commercial advantages of using the AERO System as an alternative to, or in addition to, other enhanced oil recovery methods. We must prove that the AERO System is a cost effective method of significantly increasing the amount of oil that can be recovered from a reservoir. If we are unable to demonstrate this to oil producers, we will not be able to penetrate this market, generate new business or retain existing customers. In addition, until the efficacy of our technology is more widely demonstrated we are likely to experience long sales cycles and long test cycles, which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue to date has been derived from a limited number of customers, and the loss of any of these customers could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2014, all of our service revenue was generated from 15 customers. If any of these customers terminates or significantly reduces its business with us, or if we fail to generate new business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. However, we intend to mitigate this risk by continuing to diversify our revenue stream by acquiring, restoring and operating mature oil fields that fit our criteria for the AERO System.\nOil prices are volatile, and a decline in the price of oil could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations and future growth will depend on the level of activity for oil development and production. Demand for the AERO System depends on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures for waterflooding procedures and the AERO System. Our business will suffer if these expenditures decline. The recent decline in oil prices and the uncertainty about future oil prices may adversely affect the prices we can obtain from our customers or prevent us from obtaining new customers for our services. The decline in oil prices will result in a decrease in revenues from the Coke Field and from other oil fields we acquire and make it more difficult to acquire other oil fields. Our customers\u2019 willingness to develop and produce oil using waterflooding and the AERO System is highly dependent on prevailing market conditions and oil prices that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply of or the demand for oil;\n\u2022\nthe condition of the United States and worldwide economies;\n\u2022\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nthe actions taken by foreign oil producing nations;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxes;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions or hostilities in oil producing nations;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternate fuel sources;\n\u2022\nterrorism; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of pipeline or other takeaway capacity.\nOil prices have historically been volatile and cyclical. A prolonged reduction in the price of oil will likely affect oil production levels and therefore affect demand for our services. In addition, a prolonged significant reduction in the price of oil could make it more difficult for us to collect outstanding account receivables from our customers. A material decline in oil prices or oil development or production activity levels could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOil fields, once acquired, may not be appropriate for our purposes or may have environmental or other liabilities associated with them that may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to marketing the AERO System, we intend to acquire mature fields and implement the AERO System. We cannot assure you that the oil fields we acquire will result in commercially viable projects.\nThe potential of a given property to continue to produce oil or resume production of oil and to be adaptable to the AERO System cannot be determined with a high level of precision prior to our acquisition of the property. We will continue to perform due diligence reviews of the properties we seek to acquire in a manner that we believe is both consistent with practices in the industry and necessary to determine the characteristics of such properties and the viability of the oil fields for the application of the AERO System. However, these reviews are inherently incomplete and cannot assure us of the quality of the oil fields or of the likelihood of success of the AERO System in enhancing their production of oil. It is generally not possible for us to test a property or conduct an in-depth review of its related records as part of its acquisition. Even if we are able to complete an in-depth review and sampling of these properties, such a review may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their potential for successful application of the AERO System.\nEven when problems are identified, it may be necessary for us to assume known or unknown environmental and other risks and liabilities to complete the acquisition of such properties. In addition, since the properties we are targeting are older, mature oil fields, their existing infrastructure may be out of date, damaged, in need of repair or removed, and we could incur unanticipated costs to repair or replace this infrastructure. The discovery of any unanticipated material liabilities or remediation costs or the incurrence of any unanticipated costs associated with our oil field acquisitions could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf water that is not toxic to microbes is not available at a well site, the AERO System will not work or will require additional costs either to clean the water or bring in non-toxic water to the AERO System to perform correctly and, therefore, may not be a viable option for some oil fields.\nThe AERO System requires non-toxic water to support microbial activity in the reservoir. The water used in waterflooding does not have to be potable water, but if suitable water is not being used, the AERO System will not work unless additional costs are expended to clean the water or to bring in water that is non-toxic. These additional costs may make the AERO System less cost effective or not cost effective for some oil fields. For example, in a recent implementation of the AERO System, the salinity of the produced water used in the waterflood operations was very high, making it toxic to most microbes.\nWhile our customer began using water from an existing nearby water well to provide a better environment for the microbes, which made the AERO System more effective, we may not be able to provide non-toxic water to some oil fields, eliminating these oil fields as candidates for the AERO System.\nThe AERO System is currently usable only in oil reservoirs with specific characteristics, which limits the potential market for our services.\nFor an oil reservoir to be suitable for the AERO System, the reservoir must be waterflooded or a candidate for waterflooding, must be composed of sandstone, must have permeability greater than 75 milli-darcies and must have a suitable water source. This limits the potential market for our services, which may negatively impact our results of operations and profitability.\nOur operations involve operating hazards, which, if not insured or indemnified against, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in our technology, including exposure to pressurized air that may be used in the AERO System equipment and pressurized fluids that may be associated with the water injection system, and to hazards typically associated with oil field service operations, oil field development and oil production activities, including fire, explosions, blowouts, spills and damage or loss from natural disasters, each of which could result in substantial damage to the oil producing formations and oil wells, production facilities, other property, equipment and the environment or in personal injury or loss of life.\nThese hazards could also result in the suspension of operations or in claims by employees, customers or third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Operations also may be suspended because of equipment breakdowns and failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services.\nSome of these risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical. Although we will maintain liability insurance in an amount that we consider consistent with industry practice, the nature of these risks is such that liabilities could exceed policy limits. We may not always be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification from our customers, and customers who provide contractual indemnification protection may not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial resources necessary to support their indemnification obligations. Our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect it against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations. The occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations involve risks associated with the sale and distribution of crude oil.\nThe sale of our crude oil production (if any) depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties. In addition, lack of financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and other constraints could limit or delay the construction of new gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities by third parties or us, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, or transportation facilities or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to it or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our oil production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur hedging activities may prevent the realization of the full benefits of price increases.\nTo the extent that we engage in commodity-price-risk management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk.\nIn addition, our commodity-price-risk management may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: i) our production is less than the hedged volumes, ii) there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement, iii) the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements or iv) a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil prices.\nWe periodically enter into or may enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and natural gas liquids price volatility. To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities as protection from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts.\nThe loss of key personnel or the failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could compromise our ability to effectively manage our business and pursue our growth strategy.\nOur future performance depends on the continued service of our key technical, development, sales, services and management personnel. In particular, we are heavily dependent on the following key employees: Stuart M. Page, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Pavia, Chief Technology Officer, Thomas Holland, Senior Vice President of Production, Ken Nimitz, Senior Vice President of Operations, and Victor M. Perez, Chief Financial Officer. The loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be costly and time consuming, could cause additional disruptions to our business and could be unsuccessful. We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our employees.\nOur future success also depends on the continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, development, sales, services and management personnel. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could reduce our skilled labor force and increase the wages that we must pay to motivate, retain or recruit skilled employees.\nIn addition, wage inflation and the cost of retaining our key personnel in the face of competition for such personnel may increase our costs faster than we can offset these costs with increased prices or increased sales of the AERO System.\nWe may require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals and to make future acquisitions, and a failure to obtain this capital when needed or on acceptable terms could materially affect our growth rate and force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development and commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated toward research and development, as well as demonstrating the effectiveness of the AERO System in our labs and in the field. We also intend to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future on further developing the AERO System and also we intend to expend significant resources on the acquisition and operation of additional mature oil fields to continue to test and demonstrate the AERO System in reservoirs with a variety of characteristics. We cannot assure you that debt or equity financing will be available or sufficient to meet our requirements. Our inability to access sufficient amounts of capital on acceptable terms, or at all, for our operations could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future.\nOur financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations are described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and if we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nThe enhanced oil recovery industry is large and intensely competitive. Our competition comes mainly from other methods of enhanced oil recovery, such as thermal injection (for example, steam), gas injection (for example, carbon dioxide) and chemical injection into producing properties. There are also other companies developing or planning to commercialize microbial technology that is similar to the AERO System or other emerging enhanced oil recovery technologies, including Dupont, Geo Fossil Fuels, LLC, and Titan Oil Recovery, Inc. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater recognition in the industry and substantially greater financial and other resources for developing new technologies as well as for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel than we do. Their greater financial resources may also make them better able to withstand downturns in the market, expand into new areas more aggressively or operate in developing markets without immediate financial returns.\nStrong competition and significant investments by competitors to develop new and better technology may make it difficult for us to maintain and expand our customer base, force us to reduce our prices or increase our costs to develop new technology. Our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competitive forces, to adapt to technological advances and to educate potential customers about the benefits of using our technology rather than our competitors\u2019 technology. Our failure to respond successfully to these competitive challenges could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by technological change, and if we fail to keep up with these changes, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nThe enhanced oil recovery industry is characterized by changes in technology, evolving methods of oil recovery and emerging competition. Our future business prospects largely depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes and to develop competitive products. If other enhanced oil recovery methods yield better results or are less expensive than our method, our business will suffer. We may not be able to respond successfully to new technological developments and challenges or identify and respond to new market opportunities, services or products offered by competitors. In addition, our efforts to respond to new methods of oil recovery and competition may require significant capital investments and resources, and we may not have the necessary resources to respond to these challenges. Failure to keep up with future technological changes could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition of oil fields will cause us to incur a variety of costs and could face numerous risks that would adversely affect our business and operations.\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we may acquire businesses, assets, technologies or products to enhance our business in the future. In connection with any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities which would dilute our current stockholders;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions which increase our risk of non-compliance without loan agreements; or\n\u2022\nassume significant liabilities.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and other liabilities, diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business, adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and/or prospective partners, customers and/or suppliers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses, assets, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating, financial and management resources, if at all. The integration process could divert management time from focusing on operating our business, result in a decline in employee morale and cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the business. Acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill (a non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges) incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls, which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting. If we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nIf the AERO System becomes commercially accepted, we may experience rapid growth. Any such growth would likely place significant demands on our management and on our operational and financial infrastructure. To manage growth effectively, we would need to, among other things, improve and enhance our managerial, operational and financial controls, hire sufficient numbers of capable employees and upgrade our infrastructure. We would also need to manage an increasing number of relationships with our customers, suppliers, business partners and other third parties. These activities would require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our organization as it grows, our revenues and profitability may be harmed, and we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.\nSome of our contracts will be governed by non-U.S. law, which may make them more difficult or expensive to enforce than contracts governed by United States law.\nWe expect that some of our customer contracts will be governed by non-U.S. law, which may create both legal and practical difficulties in case of a dispute or conflict. We plan to establish operations in regions where the ability to protect contractual and other legal rights may be limited compared to regions with better-established legal systems. In addition, having to pursue litigation in a non-U.S. country may be more difficult or expensive than pursuing litigation in the United States.\nOur business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to a number of United States federal laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of Treasury and the United States Department of Commerce, which could adversely affect our operations if violated.\nWe must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. We cannot provide services to certain countries subject to United States trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control of the United States Department of the Treasury or the United States Department of Commerce unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits bribes or unreasonable gifts to non-U.S. governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. In certain countries, we may engage third party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf in dealings with government officials, such as customs agents, and if these third party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in penalties or sanctions being assessed against us.\nOur international operations are subject to additional or different risks than our United States operations.\nWe intend to expand our AERO System services and operations into a number of countries outside the United States. There are many risks inherent in conducting business internationally that are in addition to or different than those affecting our United States operations, including:\n\u2022\nsometimes vague and confusing regulatory requirements that can be subject to unexpected changes or interpretations;\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically dispersed operations and culturally diverse work forces and increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ndifferences in employment laws and practices among different countries, including restrictions on terminating employees;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nimposition of currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\npotential political and economic instability in some regions;\n\u2022\nlegal and cultural differences in the conduct of business;\n\u2022\nless due process and sometimes arbitrary application of laws and sanctions, including criminal charges and arrests;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in raising awareness of applicable United States laws to our agents and third party intermediaries;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting receivables;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expense of maintaining international sales distribution channels; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining and protecting our intellectual property.\nOperating internationally exposes our business to increased regulatory and political risks in some non-U.S. jurisdictions where it operates. In addition to different laws and regulations, changes in governments or changes in governmental policies in these jurisdictions may alter current interpretation of laws and regulations affecting our business. We also face increased risk of incidents such as war or other international conflict and nationalization.\nMany of the countries in which we plan to operate have legal systems that are less developed and less predictable than legal systems in the United States. It may be difficult for us to obtain effective legal redress in the courts of some jurisdictions, whether in respect of a breach of law or regulation, or in an ownership dispute because of: (i) a high degree of discretion on the part of governmental authorities, which results in less predictability; (ii) a lack of judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules and regulations; (iii) inconsistencies or conflicts between or within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders and resolutions; (iv) the relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters or (v) a predisposition in favor of local claimants against United States companies.\nIn certain jurisdictions, the commitment of local business people, government officials and agencies and the judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may be unreliable. In particular, agreements may be susceptible to revision or cancellation and legal redress may be uncertain or time-consuming. Actions of governmental authorities or officers may adversely affect joint ventures, licenses, license applications or other legal arrangements, and such arrangements in these jurisdictions may not be effective or enforced.\nThe authorities in the countries where we operate, or plan to operate, may introduce additional regulations for the oil industry with respect to, but not limited to, various laws governing prospecting, development, production, taxes, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use, labor standards, occupational health network access and other matters. New rules and regulations may be enacted or existing rules and regulations may be applied or interpreted in a manner which could limit our ability to provide our technology. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities in the oil and gas industry could harm our operations and financial results.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect our operating results. Compliance related tax issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries. Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various taxing authorities, disagreements with taxing authorities over our tax positions and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way it conducts, or if it conducts, business in the affected countries.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $51.9 million. In general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We believe that our issuance of series B preferred stock on October 15, 2009 resulted in a Section 382 ownership change limitation. We estimate that approximately $5.4 million of our NOLs will expire early due to Section 382 ownership change limitations. In addition, if we undergo an additional ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations.\nOur loan agreements place financial restrictions and operating restrictions on our business, which may limit our flexibility to respond to opportunities and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our loan agreements restrict any future financing agreements and could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or pursue our business activities. For example, these loan agreements restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nenter into a merger, consolidate or make an investment in other entities;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens on the property secured by the loan agreements and our intellectual property;\n\u2022\npay cash dividends; and\n\u2022\nsell or dispose of our assets (including sale and leaseback arrangements), including our oil properties.\nOur compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or withstand a future downturn in our business. In addition, our note purchase agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in these loan agreements may be affected by events beyond our control. The recent decline in oil prices has increased the likelihood that we may violate covenants such as maximum leverage and collateral coverage ratios required by our loan agreements. If we violate any of the restrictions or covenants in our loan agreements, the indebtedness under the loan agreements may become immediately due and payable. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, that financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. The actual quantities and present value of our proved reserves may prove to be materially lower than it has estimated.\nThe process of estimating oil reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in our financial statements provided as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil prices, operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Although the reserve information contained herein is reviewed by our independent reserve engineers, William M. Cobb & Associates, Inc. and Collarini Associates, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data.\nActual future production, oil prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in our financial statements provided as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, prevailing oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe decline in oil price may result in impairment charges.\nDeclines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could result in impairment and decline in the value of our oil properties. The price of oil declined 36% during the fourth quarter of 2014 based on the Cushing, Oklahoma - West Texas Intermediate monthly average spot prices of $93.21 per barrel in September 2014 and $59.29 in December 2014. Subsequent to December 2014, the oil prices decreased further to $47.22 per barrel for January 2015. The 2014 decline resulted in an impairment charge of $13.2 million.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary information or technology adequately.\nOur success depends on our proprietary information and technology. We have adopted an intellectual property strategy, relying on a combination of patents and trade secret laws, as well as on confidentiality and non-compete agreements, in order to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection or any competitive advantage. Existing or future patents may be challenged, including with respect to the development and ownership thereof, or narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from developing and marketing similar technology or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our technology. In addition, any such challenge could be costly and become a significant diversion of our management\u2019s time and resources. Further, other companies may design around technology we have patented, licensed or developed and, therefore, diminish any competitive advantage we may have from our technology. Also, changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries could diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nThese concerns apply equally to patents we have licensed or may in the future license, which may likewise be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we generally do not control the patent prosecution and maintenance of subject matter that we license from others. Generally, the licensors are primarily or wholly responsible for the patent prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent applications and patents we license, while we may only be afforded opportunities to comment on such activities. Accordingly, we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over licensed intellectual property as we exercise over our own intellectual property, and we face the risk that our licensors will not prosecute or maintain it as effectively as we would like.\nThird parties may infringe or misappropriate our patents or other intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. In order to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Such litigation may be costly and may not be successful. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u2022\nassert claims of infringement;\n\u2022\nenforce our patents;\n\u2022\nenforce our licenses;\n\u2022\nprotect our trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022\ndetermine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.\nThe steps we have taken to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology may be insufficient to protect us, and we may be unable to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information. Any infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive in the future from our proprietary rights. In addition, if we operate in foreign jurisdictions in the future, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of intellectual property and the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Any actions taken in those countries may have results that are different than if such actions were taken under the laws of the United States. Patent litigation and other challenges to our patents are costly and unpredictable and represent a significant diversion of our management\u2019s time and resources. Our intellectual property may also fall into the public domain. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a disadvantage to others who did not incur the substantial time and expense we have incurred to create our technology.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosures of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our confidential and proprietary information and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, but these measures may not be effective. We require new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements also generally provide that know-how and inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us are our exclusive property. Nevertheless, these agreements may be breached or may not be enforceable, our proprietary information may be disclosed, and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, and we may not have adequate remedies for any resulting losses. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nOur technology may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Intellectual property infringement claims would be time consuming and expensive to defend and may result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims.\nClaims asserting that we have violated or infringed upon third party intellectual property rights may be brought against us in the future. We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology or third parties may have or eventually be issued patents on which our current and future technology may infringe. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Any claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages, cause us to incur significant expenses and divert management time. A court could enter orders temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoining us from making, using, selling or importing any current and future technology or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities.\nAn adverse determination in any litigation of this type could require us to design around a third party\u2019s patent or license alternative technology from another third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot do these things on a timely and cost-effective basis, our revenues may decrease substantially, and we could be exposed to significant liability. In addition, litigation is time-consuming and expensive to defend and could result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims.\nEnvironmental and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of our business.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, emission, use, transportation and discharge of hazardous substances and other materials into the environment, the integrity of groundwater aquifers and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nWe incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations could subject us to fines, injunctions or both.\nWe could be held liable for contamination at or from our current or former properties and any sites we acquire in the future, as well as for contamination at or from third party sites where we have operated or have disposed of waste, regardless of fault. We could also be subject to claims from landowners alleging property damage as a result of our operations. Further, we could be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. In addition, if we are named in an environmental lawsuit alleging contamination at any such site, even if we are not at fault, any such lawsuit could harm our reputation and be costly and become a significant diversion of our management\u2019s time and resources.\nEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Changes in, or additions to, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs.\nTherefore, no assurance can be given that our cost of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances or other materials will not materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on oil producers to obtain the appropriate permits to operate their wells and waterflood systems, and if they fail to obtain proper permits they could be subject to fines or penalties, and that could harm our business.\nIn the typical application of the AERO System to a reservoir, the well operator (which may include us) will be responsible for having all applicable permits for operating its wells and waterflood systems. If the well operator fails to have such permits, it could be subject to fines or penalties, which could, in turn, harm our business. In addition, because our technology is new, regulatory agencies may not be sure how to apply existing rules to the AERO System or may have concerns that could delay or restrict use of the AERO System in some wells. Any such delays or restrictions could harm our business.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for our products and services.\nChanges in environmental requirements may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns). State, national, and international governments and agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil or oil prices. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture and use of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations imposing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, if extended to oil recovery operations, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has recently focused on concerns about the risk of water contamination and public health problems from drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. The EPA is conducting a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. While our technology is unrelated to hydraulic fracturing, it is possible that any federal, state and local laws and regulations that might be imposed on fracturing activities could also apply to oil recovery operations.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the outcome of EPA\u2019s study or whether any new legislation or regulations would impact our business, such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which, in turn, could materially harm our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of the acquisition of the Coke Field Assets, our producing properties are located primarily in the East Texas Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nWith the closing of the Coke Field Acquisition, substantially all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the East Texas Basin. At December 31, 2014, substantially all of Glori\u2019s total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area.\nAs a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs.\nWe are susceptible to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth and expansion and have a limited operating history.\nWith the closing of the Coke Field Acquisition and the Merger, we have grown rapidly. Our management believes that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we have experienced and the demands from increased responsibility on management personnel. The following factors could present difficulties:\n\u2022\nincreased responsibilities for our executive level personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased administrative burden;\n\u2022\nincreased capital requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreased organizational challenges common to large, expansive operations.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully manage these potential difficulties. The historical financial information incorporated herein is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be realized in the future. In addition, our operating history is limited and the results from our current producing wells are not necessarily indicative of future operations.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions of properties.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u2022\noperating costs; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nThe existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we conduct customary due diligence prior to acquiring a property, the failure of title may not be discovered until after we acquire the property, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.", "PERMNO": 13597, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "GLRI"}
