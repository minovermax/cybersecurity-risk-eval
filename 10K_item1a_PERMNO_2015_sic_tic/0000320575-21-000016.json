RISK FACTORS\nThe information set forth in this Item 1A should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and the financial statements and related notes this report contains. While we attempt to identify, manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may negatively impact our business, financial condition or operating results.\nSet forth below are various risks and uncertainties that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Emergence from Bankruptcy\n\u2022We recently emerged from bankruptcy, which may adversely affect our business and relationships.\nAs a result of our bankruptcy filing and recent emergence:\n\u2022key suppliers, vendors or other contract counterparties may terminate their relationships with us or require additional financial assurances or enhanced performance from us;\n\u2022our ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022our ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022our competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted;\n\u2022our employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022we may have difficulty obtaining the capital we need to run and grow our business.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation.\n\u2022Upon our emergence from Chapter 11, the composition of our stockholder base and concentration of equity ownership changed significantly.\nAs a result of the concentration of our equity ownership, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those in the past. Upon our emergence from Chapter 11, twelve stockholder groups were the\nbeneficial owners of approximately 95% (the \u201cSignificant Stockholders\u201d) of our issued and outstanding common stock and, therefore, have significant control on the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors and approving corporate transactions. In addition, our incurrence of additional indebtedness requires the consent of each of our current stockholders that, together with their affiliates and related funds, owns more than 17.5% of our outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis, and the consent of one particular stockholder is required for us to issue additional equity as long as such stockholder, together with its affiliates and related funds, owns more than 12.5% of our outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Significant Stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of other stockholders, and the Significant Stockholders would have substantial influence to cause us to take actions that align with their interests. Should conflicts arise, we can provide no assurance that the Significant Stockholders would act in the best interests of other stockholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other stockholders.\n\u2022Upon our emergence from Chapter 11, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly.\nPursuant to the Plan, the composition of our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) changed significantly. Upon emergence, our Board consisted of five directors, only one of whom, our former Chief Executive Officer, Wm. Stacy Locke, had served on the Board prior to our emergence from Chapter 11. In July 2020, Wm. Stacy Locke resigned his officer and director positions, at which time Matthew S. Porter, a member of the Board, was also appointed to serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer, and he was subsequently appointed to serve as the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2021. Our Board currently consists of four members.\nThe new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on our Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. As a result, the future strategy and our plans may differ materially from those of the past.\n\u2022Certain information contained in our historical financial statements will not be comparable to the information contained in our financial statements after the application of fresh start accounting.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 852 and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we revalued our assets and liabilities based on our estimate of our enterprise value and the fair value of each of our assets and liabilities. These estimates, projections and enterprise valuation were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and should not be relied upon by investors for any other purpose. At the time they were prepared, the determination of these values reflected numerous estimates and assumptions, and the fair values recorded based on these estimates may not be fully realized in periods subsequent to our emergence from Chapter 11.\nThe consolidated financial statements after the Effective Date are not comparable with the consolidated financial statements on or before that date as indicated by the \u201cblack line\u201d division in the financial statements and footnote tables, which emphasizes the lack of comparability between amounts presented. This will make it difficult for stockholders to assess our performance in relation to prior periods. Please see Note 2, Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Gas Industry\n\u2022We derive all our revenues from companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.\nAs a provider of contract land drilling services and oil and gas production services, our business depends on the level of exploration and production activity in the geographic markets where we operate. The oil and gas exploration and production industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities.\nOil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities. Oil and gas prices have been volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Worldwide political, economic, and military events as well as natural disasters have contributed to oil and gas price volatility historically and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and gas prices, including:\n\u2022the worldwide supply and demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022domestic or global health concerns, including the outbreak of contagious or pandemic diseases, such as the recent coronavirus;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;\n\u2022the levels of oil and gas storage;\n\u2022the ability of oil and gas exploration and production companies to raise capital;\n\u2022economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which we refer to as OPEC;\n\u2022political instability in oil and gas producing regions;\n\u2022governmental regulations, both domestic and foreign;\n\u2022domestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development and production of their national reserves, or their investments in oil and gas reserves located in other countries; and\n\u2022the price of foreign imports of oil and gas.\nAdditionally, the above factors can also be affected by technological advances affecting energy consumption and the supply and demand within the market for renewable energy resources.\n\u2022Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, significantly impact the level of worldwide drilling and production services activities.\nReduced demand for oil and natural gas generally results in lower prices for these commodities and often impacts the economics of planned drilling projects and ongoing production projects, resulting in the curtailment, reduction, delay or postponement of such projects for an indeterminate period of time. When drilling and production activity and spending declines, both dayrates and utilization historically decline as well.\nSince January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and oil and natural gas market volatility have resulted in a significant decrease in oil prices and significant disruption and uncertainty in the oil and natural gas market. Beginning in March 2020, the decline in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with the announcement of price reductions and possible production increases by members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations, including Russia. Although OPEC and other oil exporting nations ultimately agreed to cut production, these extreme supply and demand dynamics caused significant crude oil price declines, negatively impacting our industry\u2019s oil producers who responded with significant cuts in their recent and projected spending.\nAdditionally, because our business depends on the level of spending by our clients, we are also affected by our clients\u2019 ability to access the capital markets. After several consecutive years without significant improvement in commodity prices, many exploration and production companies have limited their spending to a level which can be supported by net operating cash flows alone, as access to the capital markets through debt or equity financings has become more challenging in our industry. This challenge has increased recently due to the major stock market and bond market indices experiencing elevated levels of volatility during 2020.\nIf the reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, continues or worsens, it could materially and adversely affect us further by negatively impacting:\n\u2022our revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u2022the fair market value of our drilling and production services fleets;\n\u2022our ability to maintain or obtain additional debt financing;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business or make acquisitions, and the cost of that capital;\n\u2022the collectability of our receivables; and\n\u2022our ability to retain skilled operations personnel.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\u2022Reduced demand for or excess capacity of drilling services or production services could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur profitability in the future will depend on many factors but largely on pricing and utilization rates for our drilling and production services. A reduction in the demand for our equipment and services or an increase in the supply of comparable equipment in our industry or any particular regional market would likely decrease the pricing and utilization rates for our affected service offerings, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. The commodity price environment and global oversupply of oil during 2020 resulted in an oversupply of equipment in our industry, declining rig counts and dayrates, and substantially reduced activity for all our service offerings.\n\u2022We operate in a highly competitive, fragmented industry in which price competition could reduce our profitability.\nWe encounter substantial competition from other drilling contractors and other oilfield service companies. Our primary market areas are highly fragmented and competitive. The fact that drilling and production services equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry and may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area. Contract drilling companies and other oilfield service companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and the intensity of competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. If demand for drilling or production services improves in a region where we operate, our competitors might respond by moving in suitable rigs and production services equipment from other regions. An influx of equipment from other regions could rapidly intensify competition, reduce profitability, and make any improvement in demand for our services short-lived.\nMost drilling services contracts and production services contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition. In addition to pricing and equipment availability, we believe the following factors are also important to our clients in determining which drilling services or production services provider to select:\n\u2022the type, capability and condition of each of the competing drilling rigs, well servicing rigs, and wireline units;\n\u2022the mobility and efficiency of the equipment;\n\u2022the quality of service and experience of the crews;\n\u2022the reputation and safety record of the company providing the services;\n\u2022the offering of integrated and/or ancillary services; and\n\u2022the ability to provide drilling and production services equipment adaptable to, and personnel familiar with, new technologies and drilling and production techniques.\nWhile we must be competitive in our pricing, our competitive strategy generally emphasizes the quality of our equipment, our safety record, our ability to offer ancillary services, the experience of our crews and the quality of service we provide to differentiate us from our competitors. This strategy is less effective when lower demand for drilling and production services intensifies price competition and makes it more difficult for us to compete on the basis of factors other than price. In all of the markets in which we compete, an oversupply of drilling rigs or production services equipment generally causes greater price competition and reduced profitability.\n\u2022We face competition from many competitors with greater resources.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to:\n\u2022better withstand industry downturns;\n\u2022compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology;\n\u2022better attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u2022build new rigs or acquire and refurbish existing rigs and place them into service more quickly than us in periods of high drilling demand.\n\u2022Technological advancements and trends in our industry also affect the demand for certain types of equipment, and can affect the overall demand for the services our industry provides.\nAlthough we take measures to ensure that we use advanced technologies for drilling and production services equipment, changes in technology or improvements in our competitors\u2019 equipment could make our equipment less competitive or require significant capital investments to keep our equipment competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of major clients, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain relationships with these clients, or if their demand for our services decreases.\nHistorically, we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of major clients. While none of our clients individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in either of the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019, our drilling and production services provided to our top three clients accounted for approximately 19% and 18%, respectively, of our revenue. The loss of one or more of our major clients, or their decrease in demand for our services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Certain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our clients without penalty and/or with little or no notice.\nSome of our current drilling contracts, and some drilling contracts that we may enter into in the future, may include terms allowing our clients to terminate the contracts without cause, with little or no prior notice and/or without penalty or early termination payments. The likelihood that a client may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness.\nIn periods of extended market weakness, our clients may not be able to honor the terms of existing contracts, may terminate contracts even where there may be onerous termination fees, or may seek to renegotiate contract dayrates and terms in light of depressed market conditions. During depressed market conditions, as a result of commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond our control, a client may no longer want or need a drilling rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable drilling rig at a lower dayrate. For these reasons, clients may seek to renegotiate the terms of our existing drilling contracts, terminate our contracts without justification, leverage their termination rights in an effort to renegotiate contract terms, or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under our contracts.\nOur clients may also seek to terminate contracts for cause, such as the loss of or major damage to the drilling unit or other events that cause the suspension of drilling operations beyond a specified period of time. If we experience operational problems or if our equipment fails to function properly and cannot be repaired promptly, our clients will not be able to engage in drilling operations and may have the right to terminate the contracts. If equipment is not timely delivered to a client or does not pass acceptance testing, a client may in certain circumstances have the right to terminate the contract.\nIn the event of a cancellation, the payment of a termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Additionally, the early termination of a contract may result in a drilling rig or other equipment being idle for an extended period of time. The cancellation or renegotiation of a number of our contracts could materially reduce our revenues and profitability.\n\u2022Our operations involve operating hazards, which, if not insured or indemnified against, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in exploration and production activity, including the risks of:\n\u2022blowouts;\n\u2022cratering;\n\u2022fires and explosions;\n\u2022loss of well control;\n\u2022collapse of the borehole;\n\u2022damaged or lost drilling equipment; and\n\u2022damage or loss from natural disasters.\nAny of these hazards can result in substantial liabilities or losses to us from, among other things:\n\u2022suspension of operations;\n\u2022damage to, or destruction of, our property and equipment and that of others;\n\u2022personal injury and loss of life;\n\u2022damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations through which we drill; and\n\u2022environmental damage.\nWe seek to protect ourselves from some but not all operating hazards through insurance coverage. However, some risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical. Those risks include, among other things, pollution liability in excess of relatively low limits. Depending on competitive conditions and other factors, we attempt to obtain contractual protection against uninsured operating risks from our clients. However, clients who provide contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial resources necessary to support their indemnification obligations. Our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations. The occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a client to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.\n\u2022We could be adversely affected if shortages of equipment, supplies or personnel occur.\nWhile we are not currently experiencing a shortage of equipment or supplies, from time to time, there have been shortages of drilling and production services equipment and supplies during periods of high demand, which we believe could recur. Additionally, trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries could also affect the supply of equipment and supplies which are needed in our operations. Shortages could result in increased prices for equipment or supplies that we may be unable to pass on to clients and could substantially lengthen the delivery times for equipment and supplies. Any significant delays in our obtaining equipment or supplies could limit our operations and jeopardize our relations with clients and could delay and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts for our rigs. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to achieve proper operational results. As a result, our operations depend, to a considerable extent, on the continuing availability of such personnel. From time to time in the past, temporary shortages of qualified personnel have occurred in our industry. Recently, we have begun to experience the effects of a tightening labor market and the resulting increased labor costs associated with the limited availability of qualified personnel. If we should suffer any material loss of personnel or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment, our operations could be materially adversely affected. A significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce, increases in wage rates, or both. The occurrence of either of these events for a significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our international operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties not generally encountered in our domestic operations.\nOur international operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties not generally encountered in our U.S. operations which include, among potential others:\n\u2022risks of war, terrorism, civil unrest and kidnapping of employees;\n\u2022employee strikes, work stoppages, labor disputes and other slowdowns;\n\u2022expropriation, confiscation or nationalization of our assets;\n\u2022renegotiation or nullification of contracts;\n\u2022foreign taxation;\n\u2022the inability to repatriate earnings or capital due to laws limiting the right and ability of foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends and remit earnings to affiliated companies;\n\u2022changing political conditions and changing laws and policies affecting trade and investment;\n\u2022trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries;\n\u2022concentration of clients;\n\u2022regional economic downturns;\n\u2022the overlap of different tax structures;\n\u2022the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws;\n\u2022the risks associated with the assertion of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted;\n\u2022the risks associated with any lack of compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022the risks associated with fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange, and higher rates of inflation as compared to our domestic operations;\n\u2022difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable; and\n\u2022potentially longer payment cycles.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws and our code of conduct and ethics. We are subject, however, to the risk that our employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other similar laws. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Further, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\n\u2022Our operations are subject to various laws and governmental regulations that could restrict our future operations and increase our operating costs.\nMany aspects of our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations, including laws and regulations governing:\n\u2022environmental quality;\n\u2022pollution control;\n\u2022remediation of contamination;\n\u2022preservation of natural resources;\n\u2022transportation; and\n\u2022worker safety.\nEnvironment Protection. Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing the protection of the environment and human health and safety.\nSome of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our industry relate to the disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of those substances that can be released into the environment. Several of those laws also require removal and remedial action and other cleanup under certain circumstances, commonly regardless of fault. Our operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous wastes and/or hazardous substances. Planning, implementation and maintenance of protective measures are required to prevent accidental discharges. Spills of oil, natural gas liquids, drilling fluids and other substances may subject us to penalties and cleanup requirements. Handling, storage and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are also subject to these regulatory requirements. In addition, our operations are often conducted in or near ecologically sensitive areas, such as wetlands or protected species habitats, which are subject to special protective measures and which\nmay expose us to additional operating costs and liabilities for accidental discharges of oil, gas, drilling fluids, contaminated water or other substances, or for noncompliance with other aspects of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe federal Clean Water Act; the Oil Pollution Act; the federal Clean Air Act; the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA); regulations implementing these federal statutes (such as the \u201cNavigable Waters Protection Rule\u201d issued on January 23, 2020); and their state counterparts and similar statutes are the primary statutes that impose the requirements described above and provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \u201ccommunity right-to-know\u201d regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require us to organize and report information about the hazardous materials we use in our operations to employees, state and local government authorities and local citizens. In addition, CERCLA, also known as the \u201cSuperfund\u201d law, and similar state statutes impose strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered responsible for the release or threatened release of certain hazardous substances into the environment. These persons generally include the current owner or operator of a facility where a release has occurred, the owner or operator of a facility at the time a release occurred, and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a particular site. This liability may be joint and several. Such liability, which may be imposed for the conduct of others and for conditions others have caused, includes the cost of removal and remedial action as well as damages to natural resources. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by many environmental laws and regulations. It is also common for third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage caused by substances released into the environment.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change, and the new Biden Administration is expected to revise existing environmental regulations and to pursue new initiatives. Failure to comply with governmental requirements or inadequate cooperation with governmental authorities could subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal action. We may also be exposed to environmental or other liabilities originating from businesses and assets which we acquired from others. Our compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination or regulatory noncompliance may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate.\nThere are a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the United States and international regions in which we operate that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Further, President Biden has announced that he intends to take aggressive action to address climate-related issues and to set the United States on a path to be carbon-neutral by 2050. Among these developments at the international level is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which produced the \u201cKyoto Protocol\u201d (an internationally applied protocol, which has been ratified in Colombia, which is a location where we provide drilling services) in 1992. More recently, in December 2015, 195 countries adopted under the Framework Convention a resolution known as the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases with a goal of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C (36\u00b0F). The Paris Agreement does not establish enforceable emissions reduction targets, but countries may establish greenhouse gas reduction measures pursuant to the agreement. The agreement went into effect in November 2016. The United States ratified the Paris Agreement in September 2016 but withdrew in November 2020. President Biden has since signed an order to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The new President has also announced a focus on climate-related issues and a goal of setting the United States on the path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Also, more than one-third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. There have been two multi-state organizations devoted to climate action. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is located in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. The Western Regional Climate Action Initiative once included multiple U.S. states and much of Canada, but allowance trading is now limited to only California and Quebec, with a separate trading program administered for the province of Nova Scotia.\nIn 2007, the United States Supreme Court, in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an \u201cair pollutant\u201d under the federal Clean Air Act. In December 2009, the EPA responded to this decision and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations, and that certain greenhouse gases from motor vehicles contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change. Subsequently, the EPA has a number of climate change regulations, including greenhouse gas control and permitting requirements for certain large stationary sources, fuel economy standards for vehicles and emissions standards for power plants.\nSpecific to the oil and gas industry, in April 2012, the EPA issued regulations to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds, or VOC, emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of \u201cgreen completions\u201d to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air. The EPA also issued regulations that establish standards for VOC emissions from several types of equipment at natural gas well sites, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators and pneumatic controllers. In May 2016, the EPA issued a rule to reduce methane (a greenhouse gas) and VOC emissions from additional oil and gas operations. Among other requirements, the rules impose standards for hydraulically fractured oil wells and equipment leaks at oil and gas production sites and extend certain existing standards to downstream oil and gas operations. In 2020, the EPA amended the rule to relax regulatory requirements and to remove certain operations (relating to transport and storage) from rule applicability. We expect that the Biden Administration will reverse these changes. It is also possible that the new administration will impose more stringent requirements or promulgate additional rules concerning oil and gas emissions.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed climate change initiatives will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. Any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, these developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our clients operate and thus adversely affect demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations. Finally, we cannot predict with any certainty whether changes to temperature, storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change will have a material impact on our operations.\nIn addition, our business depends on the demand for land drilling and production services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by tax, environmental and other laws relating to the oil and gas industry generally, by changes in those laws and by changes in related administrative regulations. It is possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or those of our clients, or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations. It is possible that the Biden Administration will severely restrict oil and gas development on public lands. For example, the President has already announced a hold on new drilling permits for federal lands and waters and has proposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters. In addition, the new administration may restrict new oil and gas leasing on public lands.\nOil and gas development restrictions are also possible due to voter initiatives. For example, in 2018, Colorado voted on Proposition 112, which would have increased drilling location setbacks from 500 feet to 2,500 feet, severely limiting access to oil and gas minerals. Although Proposition 112 was defeated, future voter initiatives are possible in certain jurisdictions. Further, state legislators and regulators could seek to impose similar restrictions.\nOur wireline operations involve the use of radioactive isotopes along with other nuclear, electrical, acoustic, and mechanical devices. Our activities involving the use of isotopes are regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and specified agencies of certain states. Additionally, we use high explosive charges for perforating casing and formations, and we use various explosive cutters to assist in wellbore cleanout. Such operations are regulated by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of densitometers as well as explosive charges. We have obtained these licenses and approvals when necessary and believe that we are in substantial compliance with these federal requirements.\nTransportation. Among the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier for the transportation of our own equipment and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the\ntrucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nInterstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.\nWorker safety. Our ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and permits. An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with the investigation, remediation and resolution, as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance.\n\u2022Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our drilling and well servicing activities and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nHydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water, sand, and a minor amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Federal agencies have adopted rules, such as the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s (BLM) hydraulic fracturing rule finalized in March 2015, that impose additional requirements on the practice of hydraulic fracturing. The BLM has since rescinded the 2016 rule, but litigation challenging the replacement rule is pending, and the Biden Administration may take actions to re-propose the rule. Additional federal regulations may also be developed. Several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to concerns regarding potential environmental and physical impacts, including groundwater and drinking water impacts, as well as whether such activities may cause earthquakes.\nThe federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing practices from the definition of \u201cunderground injection.\u201d The EPA has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and has developed guidance relating to such practices. In addition, repeal of the SDWA exclusion of hydraulic fracturing has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the SDWA, which would have the effect of allowing the EPA to promulgate new regulations and permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing, and to require the disclosure of the chemical constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency, which would make the information public via the Internet.\nScrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having completed a multi-year study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. The Final Report issued by the EPA in December 2016 concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identified conditions under which impacts can be more frequent or severe. In addition, in April 2012, the EPA issued the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, which require operators to significantly reduce VOC emissions through the use of \u201cgreen completions\u201d to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air. These rules address emissions of various pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities by, among other things, requiring new or\nreworked hydraulically-fractured gas wells to control emissions through flaring or reduced emission (or \u201cgreen\u201d) completions. The rules also establish specific new requirements, which were effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants, and certain other equipment. The EPA has amended these rules several times. In May 2016, the EPA finalized a rule to reduce methane (a greenhouse gas) and VOC emissions from oil and gas operations. An amendment in 2020 relaxed some of the rule requirements and removed applicability for some sources (in the transport and storage segments of the oil and gas industry), but the Biden Administration is expected to reverse this amendment. It is also possible that the EPA will further amend its oil and gas regulations to impose more stringent requirements. These rules may require a number of modifications to our clients\u2019 and our own operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. Compliance with such rules could result in additional costs for us and our clients, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nThe EPA has also developed effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities to publicly owned treatment works (POTW). The agency\u2019s final regulations, published on June 28, 2016, prohibited any discharge of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to a POTW. The EPA was also required, pursuant to a Consent Decree with environmental groups, to reevaluate whether oil and gas wastes should continue to be exempt from being considered hazardous wastes. Although the EPA concluded in April 2019 that no changes to the existing exemption are needed, similar lawsuits could be brought in the future. The U.S. Department of the Interior has also finalized regulations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents (i.e. the BLM\u2019s hydraulic fracturing rule issued in March 2015) and has finalized, in October 2016, a rule to reduce flaring and venting associated with oil and gas operations on public lands. The BLM rules have since been rescinded, but it is possible that they will be reinstated through litigation or through rulemaking by the new Biden Administration.\nIn addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, that would require, with some exceptions, disclosure of constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on natural gas production. Moreover, public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production continued to see strong public opposition, and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas.\nIn June 2014, the State of New York\u2019s Court of Appeals upheld the right of individual municipalities in the State of New York to ban hydraulic fracturing using zoning restrictions. In December 2014, New York State Governor Cuomo announced that hydraulic fracturing will be permanently banned in the state. Similarly situated municipalities in other states may seek to ban or restrict resource extraction operations within their borders using zoning and/or setback restrictions, which could adversely affect the ability of resource extraction enterprises to operate in certain parts of the country, and thus adversely affect demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations. It is also possible that similar actions will be taken at the federal level, in light of a proposal by President Biden to impose a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters pending further study of the impacts of fracking and oil and gas production.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, incurred by our clients. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our drilling and well servicing activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Our operations are subject to cybersecurity risks.\nOur operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, malware, design defects, human error, or complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:\n\u2022loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary or confidential information (including client, supplier, or employee data);\n\u2022disruption or impairment of our and our clients\u2019 business operations and safety procedures;\n\u2022loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and\n\u2022increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nAlthough we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we do not have control over the information technology systems of our clients, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Future acquisitions or dispositions may not result in the realization of savings and efficiencies, the generation of cash flow or income, or the reduction of risk as contemplated by management, and may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time and subject to any limitations set forth in our debt agreements, we may seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions including the sale of assets or businesses, or the pursuit of acquisitions of complementary assets or businesses. These transactions are subject to inherent risks, including:\n\u2022the use of capital for acquisitions may adversely affect our cash available for other uses;\n\u2022unanticipated costs, assumption of liabilities or exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations, assets and employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulties in maintaining an effective internal control environment over an acquired business;\n\u2022risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u2022decreased earnings, revenues or cash flow resulting from dispositions; and\n\u2022increases in our expenses and working capital requirements.\nThe process of integrating an acquired business may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties that may require a disproportionate amount of management attention and financial and other resources. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may not have sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions. Historically, we have funded business acquisitions and the growth of our fleets through a combination of debt and equity financing. Subject to the limitations set forth in our debt agreements, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities or convertible securities in connection with such acquisitions. Such debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Even if we have access to the necessary capital, we may be unable to continue to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets.\nOur current debt agreements contain covenants that limit our ability to make acquisitions and incur, assume, or guarantee any additional indebtedness.\n\u2022The uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR, the London Interbank Offer Rate, as a benchmark by the end of 2021, when private-sector banks are no\nlonger required to report the information used to set the rate. LIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although the U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. In the future, we may need to renegotiate our current debt agreements or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Resources and Organization\n\u2022We have a significant amount of debt and despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur more debt. Our debt levels and the restrictions imposed on us by our debt agreements may have significant consequences, including limiting our liquidity and flexibility for successfully operating our business, pursuing business opportunities, and obtaining additional financing.\nOur level of indebtedness could prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. Because we may have to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to make interest and principal payments, we could be limited in our ability to:\n\u2022make investments in working capital or capital expenditures;\n\u2022obtain additional financing that may be necessary to fund or expand our operations; and\n\u2022withstand and respond to changes or events in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nThe incurrence of additional indebtedness could exacerbate the above risks and make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nWe also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our debt agreements that, among other things, and subject to certain exceptions limit our ability to:\n\u2022incur, assume, or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022transfer or sell assets;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022enter into mergers or consolidations; and\n\u2022issue equity securities.\nThe failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause an event of default under our debt agreements which if not waived, could result in acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness under our debt agreements, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.\n\u2022We may be unable to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, whether at maturity or as a result of acceleration.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations. We have in the past incurred, and may incur in the future, negative cash flows from our operating activities. Our ability to generate positive cash flows in the future will be influenced by:\n\u2022general industry, economic and financial conditions;\n\u2022the level of commodity prices in our industry and the level of demand for our services;\n\u2022competition in the markets where we operate; and\n\u2022other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022refinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022selling assets;\n\u2022reducing or delaying capital investments, including maintenance or refurbishment of our equipment; and/or\n\u2022seeking to raise additional capital.\nWe may not be able to repay our debt as it comes due, or to refinance our debt on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in our debt agreements. Failure to repay or to timely refinance any portion of our debt could result in a default under the terms of all our debt instruments and the acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding.\n\u2022Our current operations and future growth may require significant additional capital, and the amount and terms of our indebtedness could impair our ability to fund our capital requirements.\nOur business requires substantial capital, and we may require additional capital in the event of significant departures from our current business plan, unanticipated maintenance or capital requirements, or to pursue growth opportunities. However, additional financing may not be available on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in our debt agreements. To some extent, our ability to obtain additional capital is also reliant on the public perception of our industry, which may influence investors\u2019 willingness to invest in the energy sector.\nFailure to obtain additional financing, should the need for it develop, could impair our ability to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and meet debt service requirements, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\u2022We expect that our ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes will be substantially limited.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income and to reduce our U.S. federal income tax liability is subject to certain governing rules and restrictions. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating losses and certain other tax attributes existing as of the date of such ownership change. Upon our emergence from Chapter 11, we underwent an ownership change, as defined in the IRC, which will result in future annual limitations on the usage of our remaining domestic net operating losses.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\n\u2022We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be maintained, and the market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nOur shares of common stock are not currently listed on any stock exchange or quoted on any over-the-counter market. Although we anticipate the trading of our new common stock on the OTC market to commence again in the near future, we cannot assure you that an active public market for our common stock will develop or, if it develops, that it will be sustained. In the absence of an active public trading market, it may be difficult to liquidate your investment in our common stock.\nIn the event our common stock commences trading, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. These factors include, among other things:\n\u2022our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022our ability to repay our debt;\n\u2022investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u2022future sales, or the availability for sale, of equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022conversion of our Convertible Notes;\n\u2022limited trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022general financial, domestic, economic and other market conditions.\n\u2022In the event our common stock commences trading, the trading price of our common stock may not accurately reflect the value of our business.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, ownership of our common stock is highly concentrated, and there are a limited number of shares available for trading on any public market. As a result, any future reported trading prices for our common stock at any given time may not accurately reflect the underlying economic value of our business at that time. Any future reported trading prices could be higher or lower than the price a stockholder would be able to receive in a sale transaction, and there can be no assurance that there will be sufficient public trading in our common stock in the future to create a liquid trading market that accurately reflects the underlying economic value of our business.\n\u2022We do not intend to pay dividends on our new common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our new common stock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay or declare any dividends on our new common stock and currently intend to retain any earnings to fund our working capital needs, reduce debt and fund growth opportunities. Any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors it deems relevant, including our financial condition and performance, cash needs, income tax consequences and restrictions imposed by the Delaware General Corporation Law and other applicable laws and by our Senior Secured Notes, ABL Credit Facility, and Covertible Notes. Our debt agreements includes provisions that generally prohibit us from paying dividends on our capital stock, including our new common stock.\n\u2022We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our new common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our new common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine; however, our issuance of preferred stock is subject to the limitations imposed by our debt agreements. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our new common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions.\nSimilarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our new common stock.\n\u2022Provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThe existence of some provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including:\n\u2022provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent; and\n\u2022the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 63335, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "PESXQ"}
