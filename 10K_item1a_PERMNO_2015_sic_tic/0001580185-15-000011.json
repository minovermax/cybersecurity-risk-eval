{"cik": "1580185", "company": "J.G. Wentworth Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors generally have been separated into five groups: (1) risks related to our business operations; (2) risks related to our financial position; (3) risks related to our legal and regulatory environment; (4) risks related to our organizational structure; and (5) risks related to ownership of our Class A common stock. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us and our Class A common stock. However, the risks and uncertainties are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related To Our Business Operations\nFailure to implement our business strategy could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend on our management\u2019s ability to execute our business strategy. Key factors involved in the execution of our business strategy include:\n\u2022our continued investment in and the effectiveness of our direct response marketing programs;\n\u2022maintaining our profit margins through changing economic cycles and interest rate environments;\n\u2022increases in the volumes of structured settlement payments purchased;\n\u2022growth in our existing and new business lines;\n\u2022increased penetration of our existing markets and penetration of complementary markets; and\n\u2022our ability to continue to access our financing platform on favorable terms.\nOur failure or inability to execute any element of our business strategy could have a material adverse impact on us.\nAnnuity providers and other payors could change their payment practices for assignments of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nWe currently have established relationships and experience with various insurance companies as well as state lottery commissions and other payors. Purchases of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams require that the payors of such payment streams redirect payments from the initial payee and change the payee records within their operational and information technology systems in order to direct the purchased payment streams to us. Often, when we purchase less than all payment streams related to a receivable, the insurance company or other payor directs all of the payments streams to us, and we then take on the administrative responsibility to direct un-purchased payments to the seller or other payees. Moreover, if we complete more than one purchase transaction with a seller, the payor of the payment stream may be required to make further changes in their operational and information technology systems to cover such additional purchase and to allow us to assume additional administrative payment responsibility in order to direct multiple payment streams to different payees. Often, insurance companies or other payors are paid a fee by us in consideration for their costs and expenses in redirecting payments and updating their operational and information technology systems.\nIf, however, in the future, one or more of such insurance companies, lottery commissions or other payors were to no longer be willing to redirect payments to new payees, or allow us to assume administrative responsibility for directing payment,\nit could become more expensive or no longer possible to purchase structured settlement payments or other receivables paid by such payors, or we could incur significant legal expenses associated with compelling a payor to redirect payment to us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nWe depend on a number of third parties for the successful and timely implementation of our business strategy and the failure of any of those parties to meet certain deadlines could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue.\nOur ability to purchase structured settlement payments and lottery receivables depends on the entry of related court orders. Our ability to complete a securitization and operate our business depends on a number of third parties, including rating agencies, notaries, outside counsel, insurance companies, investment banks, the court system, servicers, sub-servicers, collateral custodians and entities that participate in the capital markets to buy the related debt. We do not control these third parties and a failure to perform according to our requirements or acts of fraud by such parties could materially impact our business. For example, there have in the past and may be in the future deficiencies in court orders obtained on our behalf by third parties that result in those court orders being invalid, including as a result of failures to perform according to our requirements and acts of fraud, in which case we would need to take additional steps to attempt to cure the deficiencies. We may or may not be successful in curing these deficiencies and, if successful, there may nonetheless be a delay in our receipt of payment streams pursuant to the court orders and if unsuccessful, we may have to repurchase such payment streams from our securitization facilities. Any delay in the receipt of, or the invalidation of, a significant number of court orders or any delay in the closing of a securitization would significantly and adversely affect our earnings.\nCompetition may limit our ability to acquire structured settlement, annuity or lottery payment streams and could also affect the pricing of those payment streams.\nOur profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams and purchase them at attractive discount rates. In acquiring these assets, we compete with other purchasers of those payment streams. In the future, it is possible that some competitors may have a lower cost of funds or access to funding sources that may not be available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of asset purchases and establish more relationships with other competitors rather than only us. Furthermore, competition for purchases of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams may lead to the price of such assets increasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns. The competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable press reports about our business model may reduce our access to securitization markets or make prospective customers less willing to sell structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams to us or to accept pre-settlement funding from us.\nThe industry in which we operate is periodically the subject of negative press reports from the media and consumer advocacy groups. Our industry is relatively new and is susceptible to confusion about the role of purchasers of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams and other alternative financial assets. We depend upon direct response marketing and our reputation to attract prospective customers and maintain existing customers. A sustained campaign of negative press reports could adversely affect our access to securitization markets or the public\u2019s perception of us and our industry as a whole. If people are reluctant to sell structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams and other assets to us, our revenue would decline.\nWe are heavily dependent on direct response marketing and if we are unable to reach prospective customers in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use direct response marketing to generate the inbound communications from prospective customers that are the basis of our purchasing activities. As a result, we have spent considerable money and resources on advertising to reach holders of structured settlements and similar products and intend to continue to do so. Our marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective and if we are unable to reach prospective customers in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we are heavily dependent on television and Internet advertising and a change in television viewing habits or Internet usage patterns could adversely impact our business. For example, the use of digital video recorders that allow viewers to skip commercials reduces the efficacy of our television marketing. There has also been a recent proliferation of new marketing platforms, including cellphones and tablets, as well as an increasing use of social media. If we are unable to adapt to these new marketing platforms, this may reduce the success and/or cost-effectiveness of our marketing efforts and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, an event that reduces or eliminates our ability to reach potential customers or interrupts our telephone system could substantially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nWe may not successfully enter new lines of business and broaden the scope of our current businesses.\nWe are growing our existing core business, we are developing strategies to leverage our highly recognizable brands, direct marketing capabilities, operational and underwriting capabilities, and low cost of capital to enter into new lines of business that are logical extensions to our core business, thus allowing us to become a diversified consumer financial services provider. For example, on March 6, 2015, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire WestStar Mortgage, Inc. (\u201cWestStar\u201d), a residential mortgage company specializing in conforming mortgage lending (the \u201cWestStar Acquisition\u201d). While we anticipate that the WestStar Acquisition will close in the third quarter of 2015, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, and we cannot assure you when, or if, it will be completed. The WestStar Acquisition represents our entry into the mortgage business. We may not achieve our expected growth if we do not successfully enter these new lines of business and broaden the scope of our current businesses. In addition, entering new lines of business and broadening the scope of our current businesses may require significant upfront expenditures that we may not be able to recoup in the future. These efforts may also divert management\u2019s attention and expose us to new risks and regulations. As a result, entering new lines of business and broadening the scope of our current businesses may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances that we may not successfully integrate or that may divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOn March 6, 2015, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire WestStar. While we anticipate that the WestStar Acquisition will close in the third quarter of 2015, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, and we cannot assure you when, or if, it will be completed. In addition, we are currently in discussions with parties regarding potential acquisition opportunities and we may pursue other acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances in the future. However, we may not be able to identify and secure suitable opportunities. Our ability to consummate and integrate effectively the WestStar Acquisition or any future acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by a number of factors, such as competition for attractive targets and, to the extent necessary for larger acquisitions, our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nIn addition, if a potential candidate is identified, we may fail to enter into a definitive agreement for the candidate on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The negotiation and completion of potential acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances, whether or not ultimately consummated, could also require significant diversion of management\u2019s time and resources and potential disruption of our existing business. Further, the expected synergies from future acquisitions or strategic alliances may not be realized and we may not achieve the expected results. Any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake will entail certain risks, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. If we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with partners, clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources. These integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period.\nWe may also have to incur significant charges in connection with future acquisitions. Future acquisitions or strategic alliances could also potentially result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness, costs and contingent liabilities. We may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from the relevant government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased costs and delay. Future strategic alliances or acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022failing to successfully integrate new operations, products and personnel;\n\u2022unforeseen or hidden liabilities;\n\u2022the diversion of financial or other resources from our existing businesses;\n\u2022our inability to generate sufficient revenue to recover costs and expenses of the strategic alliances or acquisitions; and\n\u2022potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees and customers.\nAny of the above risks could significantly impair our ability to manage our business and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on a small number of individuals, and if we lose these key personnel, our business will be adversely affected.\nMany of the key responsibilities of our business have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. Our future success depends to a considerable degree on the skills, experience and effort of our senior management. We may add additional senior personnel in the future. If we lose the services of any of our key employees, it could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not carry \u201ckey man\u201d insurance for any of our management executives. Competition to hire personnel possessing the skills and experience we require could contribute to an increase in our employee turnover rate. Our business model depends heavily on staffing our call center with highly trained personnel. High turnover or an inability to attract and retain qualified replacement personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have access to personally identifiable confidential information of current and prospective customers and the improper use of or failure to protect that information could adversely affect our business and reputation. Furthermore, any significant security breach of our software applications or technology that contains personally identifiable confidential information of current customers could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur business often requires that we handle personally identifiable confidential information, the use and disclosure of which is significantly restricted under federal and state privacy laws. As part of our normal operations, we rely on secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential customer information through computer software systems and networks. Our information technology infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to security breaches, and a party able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate private customer information. We maintain and rely on external and internal cybersecurity solutions as part of our internal controls that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to our customer\u2019s confidential data is prevented or detected in a timely manner. However, although we have not had any occurrences of a breach of our cybersecurity solutions, these internal controls may not continue to prevent unauthorized access to our software systems and networks.\nIn addition, our employees, vendors and business partners may have access to such confidential information. It is not always possible to deter misconduct by our employees, vendors and business partners, and the precautions we take to prevent disclosure of confidential information by our employees, vendors and business partners may not be effective in all cases. If our employees, vendors or business partners improperly use or disclose such confidential information, we could be subject to legal proceedings or regulatory sanctions.\nLoss or misappropriation of confidential information of our customers may result in a loss of confidence in our transactions, may greatly harm our reputation, may adversely affect or ability to maintain current or potential customer relationships, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. We maintain insurance coverage for certain losses associated with a cybersecurity breach, but we cannot guarantee that our insurance policies will fully protect us against all such losses and liabilities.\nIf the identities of structured settlement or annuity holders or of current litigants become readily available, it could have an adverse effect on our structured settlement or annuity payment purchasing or pre-settlement funding business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe expect to continue to build and enhance our databases of holders of structured settlements and annuities and of current litigants through a combination of commercial and Internet advertising campaigns, social media activities and targeted marketing efforts. If the identities of structured settlement or annuity holders or of current litigants in our databases were to become readily available to our competitors or to the general public, including through the physical or cyber theft of our databases, we could face increased competition and the value of our proprietary databases would be diminished, which would have a negative effect on our structured settlement and annuity payment purchasing and pre-settlement funding businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to integrate our operational and financial information systems or expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in the future. Our growth has placed, and will continue to place, increased demands on our information systems and other resources and further expansion of our operations will require substantial financial resources. To accommodate our past and anticipated future growth and to compete effectively, we will need to continue to integrate our financial information systems and expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce. Furthermore, focusing our financial resources on the expansion of our operations may negatively impact our financial results. Any failure to integrate our operational and financial information systems, or to expand, train, manage or motivate our workforce, may adversely affect our business.\nProblems with the technologies and third-party technology service providers that we rely upon may diminish our ability to manage essential business functions.\nThe computer networks and third-party technology services upon which our operations are based are complex and may contain undetected errors or suffer unexpected failures. We are exposed to the risk of failure of our proprietary computer systems and back-up systems, some of which are deployed, operated, monitored and supported by third parties whom we do not control. We also rely on third-party service providers for software development and system support. Any failure of our systems and any loss of data could damage our reputation and increase our costs or reduce our revenue.\nWe depend on uninterrupted computer access and the reliable operation of our information technology systems; any prolonged delays due to data interruptions or revocation of our software licenses could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and cause our customers to seek alternative service providers.\nMany aspects of our business are dependent upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage data and to maintain and upgrade our data processing capabilities. Our success is dependent on high-quality and uninterrupted access to our computer systems, requiring us to protect our computer equipment, software and the information stored in servers against damage by fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events. Interruption of data processing capabilities for any extended length of time, loss of stored data, programming errors or other technological problems could impair our ability to provide certain products. A system failure, if prolonged, could result in reduced revenues, loss of customers and damage to our reputation, any of which could cause our business to materially suffer. In addition, due to the highly automated environment in which we operate our computer systems, any undetected error in the operation of our business processes or computer software may cause us to lose revenues or subject us to liabilities for third party claims. While we carry property and business interruption insurance to cover operations, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative commentary regarding us or our brands may be posted on social media platforms and similar devices at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Consumers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. In addition, social media platforms provide users with access to such a broad audience that collective action, such as boycotts, can be more easily organized. If such actions were organized against us, we could suffer damage to our reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, our brands maintain Facebook and Twitter accounts. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nOur business may suffer if our trademarks, service marks or domain names are infringed.\nWe rely on trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our brands. Many of these trademarks, service marks and domain names have been a key part of establishing our business. We believe these trademarks, service marks and domain names have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our rights or the use by others of features based upon, or otherwise similar to, ours. In addition, although we believe we have the right to use our trademarks, service marks and domain names, we cannot assure you that our trademarks, service marks and domain names do not or will not violate the proprietary rights of others, that our trademarks, service marks and domain names will be upheld if challenged, or that we will not be prevented from using our trademarks, service marks and domain names, any of which occurrences could harm our business.\nWe operate primarily at a facility in a single location, and any disruption at this facility could harm our business.\nOur principal executive offices are located in Radnor, Pennsylvania. All of our operations are conducted at this location, including customer and technical support and management and administrative functions. We take precautions to safeguard our facility, including acquiring insurance, employing back-up generators, adopting health and safety protocols and utilizing off-site storage of computer data. Notwithstanding these precautions, any disruptions to our operations at this facility, including from power outage, systems failure, vandalism, terrorism or a natural or other disaster, such as severe weather, hurricane, fire or flood, could significantly impair our operations for a substantial period of time, result in the loss of key information and cause us to incur additional expenses. Our insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case. Some, but not all, of our employees have the ability to work remotely and our ability to function without access to our facility would be limited. In addition, most of our\nemployees live in the area surrounding our principal executive offices, and any natural or other disaster in that area will likely also affect our employees, causing them to be unable to occupy our facility, work remotely or communicate with or travel to other locations. Such damage to our facility and operations may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related To Our Financial Position\nAn increase in the cost of our financing sources, especially relative to the discount rate at which we purchase assets, may reduce our profitability.\nOur ability to monetize our structured settlement, annuity, and lottery payment stream purchases and pre-settlement funding depends on our ability to obtain temporary and/or permanent financing at attractive rates, especially relative to our purchase discount rate. If the cost of our financing increases relative to the discount rate at which we are able to purchase assets, our profits will decline. A variety of factors can materially and adversely affect the cost of our financing, including, among others, an increase in interest rates or an increase in the credit spread on our financings relative to underlying benchmark rates. Similarly, a variety of factors can materially adversely affect our purchase discount rate including, among others, increased competition, regulatory and legislative changes, including the imposition of additional or lower rate caps to those currently in effect in certain states in which we operate, the views of the courts and other regulatory bodies and the efforts of consumer advocacy groups. For further detail regarding the effect of increases in the cost of our financing sources on our business, please refer to \u201cPart II Item 7A 'Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.'\u201d\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility risk as interest rates can fluctuate in the period between when we purchase payment streams and when we securitize such payment streams.\nWe purchase structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams at a discount rate based on, among other factors, our then estimates of the future interest rate environment. Once a critical mass of payment streams is achieved, those payment streams are then securitized or otherwise financed. The discount rate at which a securitization is sold to investors is based on the current interest rates as of the time of such securitization. Interest rates may fluctuate significantly during the period between the purchase and financing of payment streams, which can reduce the spread between the discount rate at which we purchased the payment streams and the discount rate at which we securitize such payment streams, which would reduce our revenues. Volatile interest rate environments can lead to volatility in our results of operations. If we are unable to finance the payment streams we purchase at a discount rate that is sufficiently lower than the discount rate at which we make such purchases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to continue to purchase structured settlement payments and other financial assets and to fund our business is dependent on the availability of credit from our financing resources.\nWe are currently highly dependent on obtaining financing to fund our purchases of structured settlement payments and other financial assets. We currently depend on our committed warehouse lines to finance our purchase of structured settlement, annuity, and lottery payment streams prior to their securitization. We are also dependent on a committed revolving credit facility for the financing of our pre-settlement funding and a permanent financing facility for our life contingent structured settlement payments and life contingent annuity payments purchases. In order to access these facilities we are required to meet certain conditions to borrow. In the future we may not be able to meet these conditions in which case we would be unable to borrow under one or all of our facilities. In addition, these warehouse lines and other financing facilities may not continue to be available to us beyond their current maturity dates at reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to extend or replace any of our financing sources, we will have to limit our purchasing activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to complete future securitizations or other financings on favorable terms, then our business will be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to aggregate and securitize many of the financial assets that we purchase, including structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams, in the form of privately offered asset-backed securities, private placements or other term financings. The availability of financing sources is dependent in part on factors outside of our control. For example, our results in 2008 and 2009 were impacted by the financial crisis, which resulted in a lack of purchasers of our asset-backed securitizations and a resultant lack of capital availability from our warehouse facilities. We were forced to limit transaction volume without access to the securitization market and with limited warehouse capacity. We significantly scaled back new transactions, resulting in insufficient cash flow relative to our leverage. On March 31, 2009, J.G. Wentworth, LLC failed to\nmake an interest payment on certain debt and on related interest rate swap contracts. On June 4, 2009, J.G. Wentworth, LLC and certain of its affiliates completed a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, and emerged with a restructured balance sheet. In the future, we may not be able to continue to securitize our structured settlement payments at favorable rates or obtain financing through borrowings or other means on acceptable terms or at all, in which case we may be unable to satisfy our cash requirements. Our financings generate cash proceeds that allow us to repay amounts borrowed under our committed warehouse lines, finance the purchase of additional financial assets and pay our operating expenses. Changes in our asset-backed securities program could materially adversely affect our earnings and ability to purchase and securitize structured settlement, annuity, or lottery payment streams on a timely basis. These changes could include:\n\u2022a delay in the completion of a planned securitization;\n\u2022negative market perception of us;\n\u2022a change in rating agency criteria with regards our asset class;\n\u2022delays from rating agencies in providing ratings on our securitizations; and\n\u2022failure of the financial assets we intend to securitize to conform to rating agency requirements.\nWe plan to continue to access the securitization market frequently. If for any reason we were not able to complete a securitization, it could negatively impact our cash flow during that period. If we are unable to consummate securitization transactions in the future or if there is an adverse change in the asset-backed securities market for structured settlement, annuity, or lottery payment streams generally, we may have to curtail our activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and ability to operate or grow our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $450 million total indebtedness (not including indebtedness related to our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations, which is recourse only to the VIE assets on our balance sheet). In addition, on the same basis, we would have had the ability to incur $20 million of additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. Our substantial indebtedness could have a number of important consequences. For example, our substantial indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, which could result in an event of default under one or more agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in the general economic, competitive and regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less highly leveraged, as they may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, subject to compliance with our financing agreements, we have the ability to incur additional indebtedness, which would exacerbate the risks associated with our existing debt.\nWe are dependent on the opinions of certain rating agencies for the valuation of the credit quality of our assets to access the capital markets.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s and A.M. Best evaluate some, but not all, of the insurance companies that are the payors on the structured settlement, annuity and certain lottery payment streams that we purchase. Similarly, Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s, A.M. Best and DBRS, Inc. evaluate some, but not all, of our securitizations of those assets. We may be negatively impacted if any of these rating agencies stop covering these insurance companies or decide to downgrade their ratings or change their methodology for rating insurance companies or our securitizations. A downgrade in the credit rating of the major insurance companies that write structured settlements could negatively affect our ability to access the capital or securitization markets. In addition, we may be negatively impacted if any of these rating agencies stop rating our securitizations, which would adversely affect our ability to sell our securitizations and the price that we receive for them. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax or accounting policies applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability or presentation of our results.\nOur GAAP income may be significantly higher than our taxable income due to current tax and accounting laws and policies. The tax rules applicable to our business are complex and we continue to evaluate our positions and processes. If these laws and policies were to change, we could owe significantly more in income taxes than the cash generated by our operations. If we were unable for any reason to continue purchasing structured settlement annuity or lottery payment streams or other products, as well as generate current operating and marketing expenses, we could generate significant tax liabilities without a corresponding cash flow to cover those liabilities. In addition, changes in tax or accounting policies applicable to our business could also have a material adverse effect on our future profitability or presentation of our results.\nResiduals from prior securitizations represent a significant portion of our assets, but there is no established market for those residuals.\nAfter a securitization is executed, we retain a subordinated interest in the receivables, referred to as the residuals, which we include within our balance sheet within the caption VIE and other finance receivables, at fair market value. We have financed certain of our residuals under a term facility. If under forced circumstances we are required to sell our residuals to pay down debt or to otherwise generate cash for operations, we may not be able to generate proceeds that reflect the value of those residuals on our books or that are sufficient to repay the related indebtedness. In addition, a sale of the residuals under those circumstances would likely generate taxable income without sufficient cash to pay those taxes. Changes in interest rates, credit spreads and the specific credit of the underlying assets may lead to unrealized losses that negatively affect our GAAP income.\nAdditionally, certain risk retention requirements promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act and similar national and international laws could limit our ability to sell or finance our residual interests in the future and this could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to underwriting risk, particularly with respect to our pre-settlement funding.\nThe profitability of our pre-settlement funding depends on our ability to accurately underwrite both the likelihood that a personal injury case will result in a settlement as well as the amount of the settlement that is reached. Although we attempt to deploy a conservative underwriting profile by funding only a small fraction of case types with consistent settlement values and having all cases evaluated by our experienced team of in-house attorneys and paralegals, significant differences between our expected and actual collections on pre-settlement funding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the profitability of our purchases of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams depends on our selection of high quality counterparties and confirmation that there is no senior claim on the payment stream, such as child support or bankruptcy. In the event that one or more of our counterparties is unable or unwilling to make scheduled payments on a payment stream we have purchased, this may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nThe senior management team has a great deal of discretion in determining the composition of our securitization program.\nA substantial portion of our cash flow is generated on the closing of a securitization. Our senior management team decides how many securitizations we conduct per year and what asset types and amounts to include in our securitization program, based on numerous facts and circumstances. If our senior management does not accurately gauge the appropriate asset mix or timing for a securitization, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected if the Bankruptcy Code is changed or interpreted in a manner that affects our rights to scheduled payments with respect to a payment stream we have purchased.\nIf a holder of a structured settlement, annuity or lottery payment stream were to become a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code, a court could hold that the scheduled payments transferred by the holder under the applicable purchase agreement do not constitute property of the estate of the claimant under the Bankruptcy Code. If, however, a trustee in bankruptcy or other receiver were to assert a contrary position, such as by requiring us, or any securitization vehicle, to establish our right to those payments under federal bankruptcy law or by persuading courts to recharacterize the transaction as secured loans, such result could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the rights to receive the scheduled payments are deemed to be property of the bankruptcy estate of the claimant, the trustee may be able to avoid assignment of the receivable to us.\nFurthermore, a general creditor or representative of the creditors, such as a trustee in bankruptcy, of a special purpose vehicle to which an insurance company assigns its obligations to make payments under a structured settlement, annuity or lottery payment stream could make the argument that the payments due from the annuity provider are the property of the estate of such special purpose vehicle (as the named owner thereof). To the extent that a court accepted this argument, the resulting delays or reductions in payments on our receivables could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlso, many of our financing facilities are structured using \u201cbankruptcy remote\u201d special purpose entities to which structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams are sold in connection with such financing facilities. Under current case law, courts generally uphold such structures, the separateness of such entities and the sales of such assets if certain factors are met. If, however, a bankruptcy court were to find that such factors did not exist in the financing facilities or current case law was to change, there would be a risk that defaults would occur under the financing facilities. Moreover, certain subsidiaries may be consolidated upon a bankruptcy of one of our subsidiaries or the sales may not be upheld as true sales by a reviewing court. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have certain indemnification and repurchase obligations under our various financing facilities.\nIn the ordinary course of our financing activities, we provide customary indemnities to counterparties in certain financing and other transactions. No assurance can be given that these counterparties will not call upon us to discharge these obligations in the circumstances under which they are owed. In addition, in connection with financing transactions, in certain instances we retain customary repurchase obligations with respect to any assets sold into or financed under those transactions that fail to meet the represented objective eligibility criteria. Although we believe our origination practices are sufficient to assure material compliance with such criteria, certain instances have and may occur in which we are required to repurchase such assets.\nPayor insolvency and similar events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn instances where insurance companies or other payors of the assets we purchase go bankrupt, become insolvent, or are otherwise unable to pay the purchased payment streams on time, we may not be able to collect all or any of the scheduled payments we have purchased. For example, on September 1, 2011, in the Matter of the Rehabilitation of Executive Life Company of New York, or ELNY, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Nassau, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York filed an Agreement of Restructuring in connection with the liquidation of ELNY under Article 75 of the New York Insurance Laws. This restructuring plan was subsequently approved by the court. Under this plan, payment streams to be paid on certain receivables purchased by us were reduced. In the future, bankruptcies, additional insolvencies and other events may occur which limit the ability of payors to pay on time and in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related To Our Legal And Regulatory Environment\nCertain changes in current tax law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe use of structured settlements is largely the result of their favorable federal income tax treatment. In 1979, the IRS issued revenue rulings that the income tax exclusion of personal injury settlements applied to related periodic payments. Thus, claimants receiving installment payments as compensation for a personal injury were exempt from all federal income taxation, provided certain conditions were met. This ruling, and its subsequent codification into federal tax law in 1982 with the passing of the Settlement Act, resulted in the proliferation of structured settlements as a means of settling personal injury lawsuits. Changes to tax policies that eliminate this exemption of structured settlements from federal taxation could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability. Congress has previously considered and may revisit legislation that could make our transactions less attractive to prospective customers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax deferred nature of structured settlements and annuity products. If the tax treatment for structured settlements was changed adversely by a statutory change or a change in interpretation, the dollar volume of structured settlements issued could be reduced significantly, which would, in turn, reduce the addressable market of our structured settlements payment purchasing business. In addition, if there were a change in the Code or a change in interpretation that would result in adverse tax consequences for the assignment or transfer of structured settlement payments, such change could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could be assessed excise taxes that result from IRS audits of our subsidiaries\u2019 compliance with Section 5891 of the Code which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nSection 5891 of the Code, as amended by the Tax Relief Act, levies an excise tax upon those people or entities that acquire structured settlement payments from a seller on or after February 22, 2002, unless certain conditions are satisfied. Such tax equals 40% of the discount obtained by the purchaser of the structured settlement payments. However, no such tax is levied if the transfer of such structured settlement payments is approved in a qualified court order. A qualified court order under the Tax Relief Act means a final order, judgment or decree that finds that the transfer does not contravene any federal or state law or the order of any court or administrative authority and is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee\u2019s dependents. The order must be issued under the authority of an applicable state statute of the state in which the seller is domiciled, or, if there is no such statute, under the authority of an applicable state statute of the state in which the seller or annuity provider is domiciled, and issued by a court of such state or the state of the seller\u2019s domicile, or by the responsible administrative authority (if any) that has exclusive jurisdiction over the underlying action or proceeding.\nChanges in existing state laws governing the transfer of structured settlement or lottery payments or in the interpretation thereof may adversely impact our business or reduce our growth.\nThe structured settlement and lottery payments secondary markets are highly regulated and require court approval for each sale under applicable transfer statutes. These transfer statutes, as well as states\u2019 uniform commercial codes, insurance laws and rules of civil procedure, help ensure the validity, enforceability and tax characteristics of the structured settlement payments and lottery receivables purchasing transactions in which we engage. States may amend their transfer statutes, uniform commercial codes and rules of civil procedure in a manner that inhibits our ability to conduct business, including by means of retroactive laws, which would adversely impact our business. In addition, courts may interpret transfer statutes in a manner that inhibits our ability to conduct business. Failing to comply with the terms of a transfer statute when purchasing payments could potentially result in forfeiture of both the right to receive the payments and any unrecovered portion of the purchase price we paid for the payments, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes governing structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams including the means by which we conduct such business, could have a material adverse effect on our activities and revenues.\nThe structured settlements, annuities and lottery payments industries are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations. As a purchaser of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams, we are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by a number of governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels with respect to the above laws.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes could result in the enforcement of stricter compliance measures or adoption of additional measures on us or on the insurance companies and other payors that stand behind the structured settlement payments and other assets that we purchase, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any change to the regulatory regime covering the resale of any of such asset classes, including any change specifically applicable to our activities or to investor eligibility, could restrict our ability to finance, acquire or securitize such assets or could lead to significantly increased compliance costs.\nIn recent years, both federal and state government agencies have increased civil and criminal enforcement efforts relating to the specialty finance industry and how companies interact with potential customers. This heightened enforcement activity increases our potential exposure to damaging lawsuits, investigations and other enforcement actions. Any such investigation or action could force us to expend considerable resources to respond to or defend against such investigation or action and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur purchases of certain assets may be viewed as consumer lending, which could subject us to adverse regulatory limitations and litigation.\nFrom time to time, we have been named as defendant in suits involving attempts to recharacterize the purchase of non-court-ordered structured settlement payments or other assets as loan transactions. If a transaction is characterized as a loan rather than a sale, then various consumer lending laws apply, such as usury statutes, consumer credit statutes or truth-in-lending statutes. If a court finds any of our transactions are subject to consumer lending laws, we may not have complied in all respects with the requirements of the applicable statutes. The failure to comply could result in remedies including the rescission of the agreement under which we purchased the right to the stream of periodic payments and the repayment of amounts we received under that agreement.\nAdverse judicial developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse judicial developments have occasionally occurred and could occur in the future in the industries in which we do business. In the structured settlement payment purchasing industry, adverse judicial developments have occurred with regard to anti-assignment concerns and issues associated with non-disclosure of material facts and associated misconduct. Most of the settlement agreements that give rise to the structured settlement receivables that we purchase contain anti-assignment provisions that purport to prohibit assignments or encumbrances of structured settlement payments due under the agreement. If anti-assignment provisions are included in an agreement, a claimant or a payor could attempt to invoke the anti-assignment provision to invalidate a claimant\u2019s transfer of structured settlement payments to the purchaser, or to force the purchaser to pay damages. In addition, under certain circumstances, interested parties other than the related claimant or payor could challenge, and potentially invalidate, an assignment of structured settlement payments made in violation of an anti-assignment provision. Whether the presence of an anti-assignment provision in a settlement agreement can be used to invalidate a prior transfer depends on various aspects of state and federal law, including case law and the form of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted in the applicable state. Any adverse judicial developments calling into doubt laws and regulations related to structured settlements, annuities, lotteries and pre-settlements could materially and adversely affect our investments in such assets and our financing.\nPotential litigation, regulatory proceedings or adverse federal or state tax rulings could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nWe are currently subject to lawsuits that could cause us to incur substantial expenditures and generate adverse publicity. Please refer to \"Part I Item 3 'Legal Proceedings'\" in this Annual Report. We may also be subject to further litigation in the future, including potential class actions and/or trade practices litigation. We may also become subject to attempted class action or similar types of mass transaction review due to negative court rulings, such as those described in the preceding risk factor. In addition, we may be subject to litigation arising from our 2011 merger with Orchard Acquisition Company, LLC, or OAC Merger, or other transactions we have undertaken, as well as possibly those engaged in by certain of our affiliates of former affiliates.\nThe consequences of an adverse ruling in any current or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Defense of any lawsuit, even if successful, could require substantial time and attention of our senior management that would otherwise be spent on other aspects of our business and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of lawsuits may also result in significant payments and modifications to our operations.\nWe are also subject to regulatory proceedings and other governmental investigations, and we could suffer monetary losses or restrictions on our operations from interpretations of state laws in those regulatory proceedings, even if we are not a party to those proceedings. In addition, any adverse federal or state tax rulings or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, authorizes the CFPB to adopt rules that could potentially have a serious impact on our business, and it also empowers the CFPB and state officials to bring enforcement actions against companies that violate federal consumer financial laws.\nTitle X of the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services. Included in the powers afforded the CFPB is the authority to adopt rules describing specified acts and practices as being \u201cunfair,\u201d \u201cdeceptive\u201d or \u201cabusive,\u201d and hence unlawful. The CFPB could adopt rules imposing new and potentially burdensome requirements and limitations with respect to our lines of business. In addition to Dodd-Frank\u2019s grant of regulatory powers to the CFPB, Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws.\nIn these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders and civil monetary penalties. Also, where a company has violated Title X of Dodd-Frank or CFPB regulations under Title X, Dodd-Frank empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). If the CFPB or one or more state officials believe we have violated the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn March 2014, the Company and certain of its affiliates were served with Civil Investigative Demands, or CIDs, from the CFPB. The CIDs request various information and documents for the purpose of determining the Company\u2019s compliance with Sections 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5531, 5536; the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 et seq., or its implementing regulations, and other Federal-consumer financial laws. The CIDs appear to be designed to broadly solicit general information about the Company and its business. We believe that the Company\u2019s practices are fully compliant with applicable law, and we have cooperated with the CFPB.\nIncreased regulation of asset-backed securities offerings under the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn March 29, 2011, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking proposing rules to implement the credit risk retention requirements of section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, as amended by Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor must retain at least 5% of the credit risk of any asset pool that is securitized. These federal regulators jointly re-proposed this rule on August 28, 2013. It remains unclear what requirements will be included in the final rule and what the ultimate impact of the final rule will be on the marketability of our asset-backed securities or our ability to structure and complete future asset-backed securitizations and other financings. Moreover, we cannot predict whether other similar rules and restrictions will be promulgated in the future, including, without limitation, revisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission to Regulation AB. Such regulations, rules and laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe regulatory environment for pre-settlement funding, including the means by which we conduct such business, is uncertain, and changes to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes governing pre-settlement funding could have a material adverse effect on our activities.\nThe regulatory framework for pre-settlement funding is still in its early stages and is evolving rapidly. Most states currently do not have any laws specifically addressing pre-settlement funding, and the regulatory framework is based on state-specific case laws. We expect that a consistent national regulatory framework will develop in the future, and while we are currently working with relevant trade organizations to draft a model act, there exists considerable uncertainty as to the form of this regulatory framework. This future regulation could force us to significantly alter our strategy or restrict our ability to provide pre-settlement funding.\nRisks Related To Our Organizational Structure\nAs a holding company, we have no operations and our only material asset is our economic interest in JGW LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from JGW LLC to pay our expenses, taxes and dividends (if and when declared by our board of directors).\nWe are a holding company and have no material direct operations or assets other than our ownership of Common Interests in JGW LLC. We have no independent means of generating revenue and as a result are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our Class A common stock. We intend to cause JGW LLC to make distributions to us, as its managing member, in an amount sufficient to cover all expenses, applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by our board of directors. However, our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and may be prohibited or restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. To the extent that we need funds and JGW LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under any present or future debt covenants or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to pay certain holders of Common Interests in JGW LLC for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of any tax basis step-up we receive in connection with any future exchanges of such Common Interests and related transactions with JGW LLC.\nHolders of Common Interests in JGW LLC other than us, or the Common Interestholders may in the future exchange Common Interests in JGW LLC for Class A common stock or, in the case of PGHI Corp., shares of our Class C common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (the \"Class C common stock\u201d), on a one-for-one basis (or, at JGW LLC\u2019s option, cash). JGW LLC is expected to have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code, which may result in an adjustment to our share of the tax basis of the assets owned by JGW LLC at the time of such initial sale of and subsequent exchanges of Common Interests in JGW LLC. The sale and exchanges may result in increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of JGW LLC that otherwise would not have been available. Any such increases in tax basis are, in turn, anticipated to create incremental tax deductions that would reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future.\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with all Common Interestholders who hold in excess of approximately 1% of the Common Interests in JGW LLC outstanding immediately prior to our IPO requiring us to pay\nthem 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize in any tax year from increases in tax basis realized as a result of any future exchanges by Common Interestholders of their Common Interests in JGW LLC for shares of Class A common stock or shares of Class C common stock (or cash). We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that we actually realize during a covered tax year. The cash savings in income tax paid to any such Common Interestholders will reduce the cash that may otherwise be available to us for our operations and to make future distributions to holders of shares of Class A common stock.\nFor purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing our actual income tax liability for a covered tax year to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay for such covered tax year had there been no increase to our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of JGW LLC as a result of such sale and any such exchanges and had we not entered into the tax receivable agreement. The tax receivable agreement continues until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the tax receivable agreement upon a change of control for an amount based on the remaining payments expected to be made under the tax receivable agreement.\nJLL Partners and its affiliates, collectively \u201cJLL\u201d, owns a portion of its investment through an existing corporation. On October 7, 2014, we executed a merger, the \"Blocker Merger\" where JLL received shares of newly issued Class A common stock, we acquired the entity, and we therefore, succeeded to certain tax attributes, if any, of said corporation. Please refer to Note 2 in \"Part II Item 8 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.'\" The tax receivable agreement requires us to pay the shareholders of such corporation for the use of any such attributes in the same manner as payments made for cash savings from increases in tax basis as described above.\nThe owners of PGHI Corp., including DLJ Merchant Banking Partners IV, L.P. and affiliates of Credit Suisse Group AG, own their investment through PGHI Corp. In the event we engage in a merger with such corporation in which the shareholders of that corporation receive the shares of Class C common stock directly, we will succeed to certain tax attributes, if any, of such corporation. The tax receivable agreement requires us to pay the shareholders of such corporation for the use of any such attributes above a specific amount in the same manner as payments made for cash savings from increases in tax basis as described above.\nWhile the actual amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors (including the timing of exchanges, the amount of gain recognized by an exchanging Common Interestholder, the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates in effect at the time any incremental tax deductions resulting from the increase in tax basis are utilized) we expect that the payments that we may make to the Common Interestholders that are parties to the tax receivable agreement could be substantial during the expected term of the tax receivable agreement. We will bear the costs of implementing the provisions of the tax receivable agreement. A tax authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases or the amount or availability of any tax attributes discussed above, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain such a challenge. The Common Interestholders that are party to the tax receivable agreement will not reimburse us for any payments previously made to them in the event that, due to a successful challenge by the IRS or any other tax authority of the amount of any tax basis increase or the amount or availability of any tax attributes, our actual cash tax savings are less than the cash tax savings previously calculated and upon which prior payments under the tax receivables were based. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments under the tax receivable agreement to the Common Interestholders that are party thereto in excess of our cash tax savings. A successful challenge to our tax reporting positions could also adversely affect our other tax attributes and could materially increase our tax liabilities.\nIn certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement to the Common Interestholders may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement, and if the tax reporting positions we determine are not respected, our tax attributes could be adversely affected and the amount of our tax liabilities could materially increase.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain changes of control, we will be required to pay the Common Interestholders amounts based on assumptions regarding the remaining payments expected to be made under the tax receivable agreement (at our option, these payments can be accelerated into a single payment at the time of the change of control). As a result, we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement, and the upfront payment may be made years in advance of any actual realization of such future benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and we will not be reimbursed by the Common Interestholders for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments we make under the tax receivable agreement could significantly exceed the cash tax or\nother benefits, if any, that we actually realize. In addition, if the tax reporting positions we determine are not respected, our tax attributes could be adversely affected and the amount of our tax liabilities could materially increase.\nControl by JLL of 76.3% of the combined voting power of our common stock and the fact that it is holding its economic interest through JGW LLC may give rise to conflicts of interest.\nAs of December 31, 2014, JLL controlled 76.3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. As a result, JLL is able to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders or deprive holders of Class A common stock of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock as part of a sale of our business.\nThe interests of JLL may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. JLL has significant relationships which it has developed over the years or may develop in the future and these relationships may affect who we work with to implement our strategy and could be influenced by motivations that may not directly benefit us, subject to applicable fiduciary or contractual duties. Also, JLL may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders.\nIn addition, because much of JLL\u2019s economic interests is held in JGW LLC directly, rather than through us, JLL may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of Class A common stock. For example, JLL will have different tax positions from the holders of shares of Class A common stock which could influence its decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, and whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreement. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration JLL\u2019s tax considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. Also, JGW LLC may sell additional Common Interests in JGW LLC to its current equity holders or to third parties, which could dilute the indirect aggregate economic interest of the holders of the Class A common stock in JGW LLC. Any such issuance would be subject to our approval as the managing member of JGW LLC.\nThe influence of JLL over our policies is further enhanced by the terms of the Director Designation Agreement that we entered into with JLL and PGHI Corp. in connection with the IPO, the Voting Agreement that JLL, PGHI Corp., and certain other Common Interestholders entered into in connection with the IPO and by the provisions of our certificate of incorporation. Under the terms of the Director Designation Agreement, JLL has the right to designate four director designees to our board of directors so long as JLL owns at least 934,488 Common Interests in JGW LLC and at least 20% of the aggregate number of Common Interests in JGW LLC held on such date by members of JGW LLC who were members of JGW LLC (or its predecessor of the same name) on July 12, 2011, and PGHI Corp. have the right to designate one director so long as PGHI Corp. (together with its then-current stockholders) or its assignee holds in the aggregate at least 436,104 Common Interests in JGW LLC. The parties to the Voting Agreement agree to vote all of their shares of Class A common stock (if any) and their shares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, (if any) in favor of the election to our board of directors of our Chief Executive Officer, four designees of JLL and one designee of PGHI Corp. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, the four directors designated by JLL are each entitled to cast two votes on each matter presented to our board of directors until the earlier to occur of such time as we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange or NYSE corporate governance standards or such time as JLL ceases to hold, in the aggregate, at least 934,488 Common Interests in JGW LLC and at least 20% of the aggregate number of Common Interests in JGW LLC held on such date by members of JGW LLC who were members of JGW LLC (or its predecessor of the same name) on July 12, 2011. Because our board consists of fewer than twelve directors, the four directors designated by JLL are, for so long as such directors have the right to cast two votes, able to determine the outcome of all matters presented to the board for approval.\nOur directors who are affiliated with JLL, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners IV, L.P., PGHI Corp. and their respective investment funds do not have any obligation to report corporate opportunities to us.\nAlexander R. Castaldi, Kevin Hammond, Paul S. Levy, Robert N. Pomroy, and Francisco J. Rodriguez serve as our directors and also serve as partners, principals, directors, officers, members, managers, affiliates, service providers and/or employees of one or more of JLL, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners IV, L.P., PGHI Corp., and their respective affiliates and investment funds, which we refer to as the Corporate Opportunity Entities. Because the Corporate Opportunity Entities may engage in similar lines of business to those in which we engage, our certificate of incorporation allocates corporate opportunities between us and these entities. Specifically, none of the Corporate Opportunity Entities has any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as do we. In addition, if any of them acquires knowledge\nof a potential transaction that may be a corporate opportunity for us and for the Corporate Opportunity Entities, subject to certain exceptions, we will not have any expectancy in such corporate opportunity, and they will not have any obligation to communicate such opportunity to us. Our stockholders are deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nThe above provision shall automatically, without any need for any action by us, be terminated and void at such time as the Corporate Opportunity Entities beneficially own less than 15% of our shares of common stock.\nRisks Related To Ownership Of Our Class A Common Stock\nAs a controlled company, we are not subject to all of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE.\nWe are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the rules of the NYSE. Controlled companies are exempt from the NYSE\u2019s corporate governance rules requiring that listed companies have (i) a majority of the board of directors consist of \u201cindependent\u201d directors under the listing standards of the NYSE, (ii) a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors and a written nominating/corporate governance committee charter meeting the NYSE\u2019s requirements, and (iii) a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a written compensation committee charter meeting the requirements of the NYSE. As a result of relying on certain on these exemptions, we do not have a majority of independent directors, our nomination and corporate governance committee and compensation committee does not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which may divert from our business operations.\nAs a result of our IPO, we became subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. As a result, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur.\nFurthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our business strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls, including IT controls, and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will continue to materially increase our general and administrative expenses.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have opted to take advantage of some of these exemptions. As a result, we do not know if some investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive. The result may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those\nstandards would otherwise apply to private companies. We may opt to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock is volatile and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nthe contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nany increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or others and developments affecting us;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs and policies;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nspeculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;\n\u2022\nincreases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher yield;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which we conduct our operations; and\n\u2022\na breach of security or a cybersecurity attack.\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional Class A common stock or offering debt or other equity securities. In particular, future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-based acquisition financing and/or cash from operations. For example, up to 25% of the purchase price for the WestStar Acquisition may be financed by issuing shares of our Class A common stock.\nIssuing additional Class A common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our Class A common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of such debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our Class A common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our Class A Shares bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our Class A Shares and dilute their stockholdings in us.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility of these sales, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIn connection with our IPO, we registered the exchange of 18,366,135 Common Interests in JGW LLC. The Class A common stock received upon exchange of Common Interests in JGW LLC may be freely resold into the public market unless held by a Common Interestholder which is an affiliate of us. Certain of these holders (as well as other Common Interestholders) have the right to demand that we register the resale of their Class A common stock received upon exchange and certain \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline significantly when the restrictions on resale by our existing stockholders lapse. A decline in the price of our Class A common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of Class A common stock or other equity securities.\nThe future issuance of additional Class A common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have an aggregate of 484,978,853 Class A common stock authorized but unissued. We may issue all of these Class A common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. Any Class A common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans or acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or warrants or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by current holders of our Class A common stock. For example, up to 25% of the purchase price for the WestStar Acquisition may be financed by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, which issuance will dilute the percentage ownership held by current holders of our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law and our organizational documents, as well as our existing and future debt agreements, may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\ndelegate the sole power of a majority of the board of directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide the power of our board of directors to fill any vacancy on our board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nentitle the four directors designated by JLL pursuant to the Director Designation Agreement to cast two votes on each matter presented to the board of directors until the earlier to occur of such time as we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards or such time as JLL\nceases to hold, in the aggregate, at least 934,488 Common Interests in JGW LLC and at least 20% of the aggregate number of Common Interests in JGW LLC held on such date by members of JGW LLC who were members of JGW LLC (or its predecessor of the same name) on July 12, 2011;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, the documents governing certain of our debt agreements impose, and we anticipate documents governing our future indebtedness may impose, limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions. Under these documents, the occurrence of a change of control transaction could constitute an event of default permitting acceleration of the indebtedness, thereby impeding our ability to enter into certain transactions.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the significant common stock ownership by JLL, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our company or our sector, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts, nor can we assure that any analysts will continue to follow us and issue research reports. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our company or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 14288, "SIC": 6153, "TIC": "JGWEQ"}
