{"cik": "1385508", "company": "OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to the Company\nThe Company has generated limited revenue to date and expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company was incorporated on June 21, 2005. The Company operates as a specialty pharmaceutical company which develops pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. The Company has generated limited revenues from inception through the date of this Annual Report. The likelihood of the Company\u2019s future success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays often encountered in connection with the clinical trials that will be conducted and on the development of new solutions to common addictions and related disorders. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated clinical trial delays, poor data, changes in the regulatory and competitive landscape and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current budget estimates. In order to complete certain clinical trials and otherwise operate pursuant to the Company\u2019s current business strategy, the Company anticipates that it will incur increased operating expenses. In addition, the Company expects to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and the Company also expects to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as the Company funds the Company\u2019s operating losses and capital expenditures. The Company recognizes that if the Company is unable to generate sufficient revenues or source funding, the Company will not be able to continue operations as currently contemplated, complete planned clinical trials or achieve profitability. The Company\u2019s failure to achieve or maintain profitability will also negatively impact the value of the Company\u2019s securities. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that the Company will prove successful. If the Company is unsuccessful in addressing these risks, then the Company will most likely fail.\nThe Company\u2019s independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for the Company which includes a statement describing the company\u2019s going concern status. The Company\u2019s financial status creates a doubt whether the Company will continue as a going concern.\nBased on the Company\u2019s financial history since inception, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has generated limited revenue to date. The Company has not consistently attained profitable operations and has historically depended upon obtaining sufficient financing and generating limited revenues to fund its operations. The Company anticipates that its revenues will not be sufficient to support its current operations and additional funding will be required in the form of debt financing and/or equity financing and/or financings from the sale of interests in the Company\u2019s prospective products and/or royalty transactions. Despite its best efforts, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient revenues or raise sufficient funding to fund the Company\u2019s operations. If the Company is unable to achieve the foregoing, then the Company may be unable to continue operating as currently planned or to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company may not succeed in completing the development of the Company\u2019s product candidates, commercializing the Company\u2019s products, and generating significant revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s pipeline includes a treatment for BED, a treatment for BN, a treatment for CocUD, a heroin vaccine and additional treatment applications. The Company\u2019s products have generated limited revenues. The Company\u2019s ability to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability depends on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully complete the development of its product candidates, obtain market approval, successfully launch its products and generate significant revenues. On December 15, 2014, the Company and Adapt entered into the Adapt Agreement that provides Adapt with a global license to develop and commercialize the Company\u2019s intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, now known as NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray. The loss for any reason of Adapt as a key partner could have a significant and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. If the Company is unable to retain Adapt as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to commercialize the Company\u2019s treatment as planned and the Company may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of the treatment.\nThe future success of the Company\u2019s business cannot be determined at this time, and the Company does not anticipate generating significant revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company expects to generate revenues from NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, for which the Company is dependent on many factors, including the performance of the Company\u2019s licensing partner Adapt and competition in the market. In addition, the Company has no experience in commercializing its treatments on its own and faces a number of challenges with respect to its commercialization efforts, including, among other challenges, that:\n\u2022 the Company may not have adequate financial or other resources to complete the development of its product candidates;\n\u2022 the Company may not be able to manufacture its products in commercial quantities, at an adequate quality, at an acceptable cost or in collaboration with third parties;\n\u2022 The Company may experience delays or unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing or manufacturing;\n\u2022 the Company may not be able to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution channels;\n\u2022 healthcare professionals and patients may not accept the Company\u2019s treatments;\n\u2022 the Company may not be aware of possible complications from the continued use of its products since the Company has limited clinical experience with respect to the actual use of its products;\n\u2022 technological breakthroughs in reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with BED, BN, CocUD and heroin addiction may reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022 changes in the market for reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with BED, BN, CocUD and heroin addiction, new alliances between existing market participants and the entrance of new market participants may interfere with the Company\u2019s market penetration efforts;\n\u2022 third-party payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of the Company\u2019s products, which may adversely affect patients\u2019 willingness to purchase the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022 uncertainty as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022 the Company may face third party claims of intellectual property infringement;\n\u2022 the Company may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for its products in the Company\u2019s target markets or may face adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to its products even if regulatory approval is obtained; and\n\u2022 the Company is dependent upon the results of clinical studies relating to its products and the products of its competitors. If data from a clinical trial is unfavorable, the Company would be reluctant to advance the specific product for the indication for which it was being developed.\nIf the Company is unable to meet any one or more of these challenges successfully, the Company\u2019s ability to effectively commercialize its products could be limited, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven the Company\u2019s lack of revenue and cash flow, the Company will need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to the Company or, even if consummated, may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to operate.\nSince the Company may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or cash flow to fund its operations for the foreseeable future, the Company will need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand its operations. The Company may also need additional funding to continue the development of its product candidates, build its sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity or develop or acquire complementary technologies, assets and companies, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes.\nThe Company does not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital if needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, the Company may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of its product candidates and other business opportunities and its ability to achieve its business objectives, its competitiveness and its operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s inability to fund its business could thus lead to the loss of your investment.\nIf the Company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities and/or equity-linked securities, the percentage ownership of the Company\u2019s existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. The Company may also issue equity securities and/or equity-linked securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of its Common Stock. Given the Company\u2019s need for cash and that equity and equity-linked issuances are very common types of fundraising for companies like the Company, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for stockholders of the Company.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on the Company\u2019s assets and covenants limiting or restricting the Company\u2019s ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing could also be required to be repaid regardless of the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIf the Company raises additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, the Company may be required to relinquish some rights to its products or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s current and future operations substantially depend on the Company\u2019s management team and the Company\u2019s ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends and will continue to depend in substantial part on the continued service of Dr. Roger Crystal and Kevin Pollack, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. The loss of the services of either of these individuals would significantly impede implementation and execution of the Company\u2019s business strategy and may result in the failure to reach its goals.\nThe Company\u2019s future viability and ability to achieve sales and profits will also depend on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing its operations. There is a risk that the Company will be unable to attract, train, retain or motivate qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and the Company\u2019s failure to do so may severely damage its prospects.\nIf the Company is unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the Company\u2019s products and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, the Company\u2019s competitors could develop and commercialize products and product candidates similar or identical to the Company\u2019s, and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize the Company\u2019s products and product candidates may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial success will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to the Company\u2019s products and product candidates. The Company seeks to protect the Company\u2019s proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to the Company\u2019s products and product candidates that are important to the Company\u2019s business, as appropriate. The Company cannot be certain that patents will be issued or granted with respect to applications that are currently pending or that the Company may apply for in the future with respect to one or more of the Company\u2019s products and product candidates, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and the Company may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that the Company will fail to identify patentable aspects of the Company\u2019s research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although the Company may enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of the Company\u2019s research and development output, such as the Company\u2019s employees, distribution partners, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing the Company\u2019s ability to seek patent protection.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of the Company\u2019s patent rights are highly uncertain. The Company\u2019s pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued, and even if issued, the patents may not meaningfully protect the Company\u2019s products or product candidates, effectively prevent competitors and third parties from commercializing competitive products or otherwise provide the Company with any competitive advantage. The Company\u2019s competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent the Company\u2019s patents by developing similar or alternative products in a non-infringing manner.\nChanges in either the patent laws, implementing regulations or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may also diminish the value of the Company\u2019s patents or narrow the scope of the Company\u2019s patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect the Company\u2019s rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company cannot be certain that the Company\u2019s patents and patent rights will be effective in protecting the Company\u2019s products, product candidates and technologies. Failure to protect such assets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe Company may face litigation from third parties claiming that the Company\u2019s products infringe on their intellectual property rights, or seek to challenge the validity of the Company\u2019s patents.\nThe Company\u2019s future success is also dependent in part on the strength of the Company\u2019s intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which have been developed from years of research and development. In addition to the litigation with TEVA discussed below, the Company may be exposed to additional future litigation by third parties seeking to challenge the validity of the Company\u2019s rights based on claims that the Company\u2019s technologies, products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others or are invalid, or that the Company has misappropriated the trade secrets of others.\nSince the Company\u2019s inception, the Company has sought to contract with manufacturers to supply commercial quantities of pharmaceutical formulations and products. As a result, the Company has disclosed, under confidentiality agreements, various aspects of the Company\u2019s technology with potential manufacturers and suppliers. The Company believes that these disclosures, while necessary for the Company\u2019s business, may have resulted and may result in the attempt by potential manufacturers and suppliers to improperly assert ownership claims to the Company\u2019s technology in an attempt to gain an advantage in negotiating manufacturing and supplier rights.\nOn September 15, 2016, the Company and Adapt received the Notice Letter from TEVA, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(B)(ii), that TEVA had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray before the expiration of the \u2018253 patent. The \u2018253 patent is listed with respect to NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book and expires on March 16, 2035. TEVA\u2019s Notice Letter asserts that its generic product will not infringe the \u2018253 patent or that the \u2018253 patent is invalid or unenforceable. The Company and Adapt have been evaluating TEVA\u2019s Notice Letter. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray and expects that the \u2018253 patent will be vigorously defended from any infringement. The Company may receive additional Notice Letters from other companies seeking to market generic versions of NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the future and, after evaluation, the Company may commence patent infringement lawsuits against such companies.\nOn October 21, 2016, Adapt, Adapt Pharma Operations Limited and the Company (collectively, the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed a complaint for patent infringement against TEVA and TEVA Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (collectively, the \u201cDefendants\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from TEVA\u2019s U.S.\u2019s filing of the ANDA with the FDA. The Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, an order that the effective date of FDA approval of the ANDA be a date later than the expiration of the \u2018253 patent, as well as equitable relief enjoining the Defendants from infringing the \u2018253 patent and monetary relief as a result of any such infringement. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray and expects that the \u2018253 patent will continue to be vigorously defended from any infringement. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful with respect to this litigation matter. Such a failure may have a material impact on the Company and its business operations in the future.\nThe expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely affect the Company\u2019s future revenues and operating earnings.\nThe Company relies on patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of the Company\u2019s products and product candidates. In particular, patent protection is important in the development and eventual commercialization of the Company\u2019s products and product candidates. Patents covering the Company\u2019s products and product candidates normally provide market exclusivity, which is important in order for the Company\u2019s products and product candidates to become profitable.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s patents will expire in the next 18 to 21 years. While the Company is seeking additional patent coverage which may protect the technology underlying these patents, there can be no assurances that such additional patent protection will be granted, or if granted, that these patents will not be infringed upon or otherwise held enforceable. Even if the Company is successful in obtaining a patent, patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for the Company\u2019s products and product candidates, the Company may be open to competition from generic versions of such methods and devices.\nThe Company may be exposed to product liability risks, and clinical and preclinical liability risks, which could place a substantial financial burden upon the Company should the Company be sued.\nThe Company\u2019s business exposes the Company to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. The Company cannot be sure that claims will not be asserted against the Company. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company cannot give assurances that the Company will be able to continue to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage that the Company may obtain could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s products may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require it to be taken off the market, require it to include safety warnings or otherwise limit sales of the product.\nUnforeseen side effects from the Company\u2019s products and product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the Company\u2019s products have been marketed. This could cause regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, the Company\u2019s products to be harder and more costly to obtain.\nTo date, no serious adverse events have been attributed to the Company\u2019s products and product candidates. The results of the Company\u2019s planned or any future clinical trials may show that the Company\u2019s products and product candidates causes undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings. If the Company\u2019s product candidates receive marketing approval and the Company or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by the use of the Company\u2019s products:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the products, which would force the Company to remove its products from the market;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians, pharmacies and others;\n\u2022 the Company may be required to change instructions regarding the way the products are administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the products;\n\u2022 the Company may be subject to limitations on how it may promote the products;\n\u2022 sales of the products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022 the Company may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 the Company\u2019s reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent the Company or its potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent the Company from generating significant revenues from the sale of its products.\nThe Company currently has no marketing and sales organization and has no experience marketing pharmaceutical products. If the Company is unable to establish its own marketing and sales capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell the Company\u2019s products after approval, the Company may not be able to generate product revenues.\nThe Company does not have a sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of any pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize the Company\u2019s products or any other product candidates the Company may develop or acquire in the future, the Company must develop these capabilities on its own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of its products. The establishment and development of the Company\u2019s own sales force will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and the Company cannot be certain that it would be able to successfully develop this capability. As a result, the Company may seek one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales, marketing and distribution of its products. There also may be certain markets within the U.S. and elsewhere for the Company\u2019s products for which the Company may seek a co-promotion arrangement. However, the Company may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell its products on favorable terms, or at all. In the event the Company is unable to develop its own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third party marketing and sales organization, the Company will not be able to commercialize its products or any other product candidates that it develops, which will negatively impact its ability to generate product revenues. Furthermore, whether the Company commercializes products on its own or relies on a third party to do so, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue would be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force. In addition, to the extent the Company relies on third parties to commercialize its approved products, the Company would likely receive less revenues than if the Company commercialized these products itself.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s products is rapidly changing and competitive, and new drugs, which may be developed by others, could impair the Company\u2019s ability to maintain and grow the Company\u2019s business and remain competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render the Company\u2019s technologies and products noncompetitive or obsolete. The Company also may be unable to keep pace with technological developments and other market factors. Technological competition from medical device, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities and budgets than the Company does, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s reliance on collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize the Company\u2019s products, such as the Adapt Agreement to develop and commercialize the Company\u2019s intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, is subject to inherent risks and may result in delays in product development and lost or reduced revenues, restricting the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize the Company\u2019s products and adversely affecting the Company\u2019s profitability.\nWith respect to the products the Company has licensed, the Company depends upon collaborations with third parties to develop these product candidates and the Company depends substantially upon third parties to commercialize these products. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, manufacture and commercialize the Company\u2019s existing and possibly future product candidates depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to maintain existing, and enter into and maintain new, contractual and collaborative arrangements with others. The Company also engages, and intends in the future to continue to engage, contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators.\nIn addition, although not a primary component of the Company\u2019s current strategy, the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development has led the Company in the past, and may continue to require the Company, to enter into license or other collaborative agreements with others, including other pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Such collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates would typically require the Company to pay license fees, make milestone payments and/or pay royalties. Furthermore, these agreements may result in the Company\u2019s revenues being lower than if the Company developed the Company\u2019s product candidates on the Company\u2019s own and in the Company\u2019s loss of control over the development of the Company\u2019s product candidates.\nContractors or collaborators may have the right to terminate their agreements with the Company or reduce their payments to the Company under those agreements on limited or no notice and for no reason or reasons outside of the Company\u2019s control. For example, the Company may be unable to maintain its relationship with Adapt on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, as the Adapt agreement may be terminated by Adapt in its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice to the Company. In addition, Adapt may have similar or more established relationships with the Company\u2019s competitors or larger customers which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s relationship with Adapt. Moreover, the loss for any reason of Adapt as a key partner could have a materially significant and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. If the Company is unable to retain Adapt as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to commercialize the Company\u2019s products as planned and the Company may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of the Company\u2019s products. The same could apply to other product candidates the Company may develop or acquire in the future. The Company\u2019s dependence upon third parties to assist with the development and commercialization of the Company\u2019s product candidates may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate profits or acceptable profit margins and the Company\u2019s ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely and competitive basis. Additionally, the Restated Aegis Agreement expires on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Opiant Negotiation Periods and (ii) on 30 days\u2019 prior written notice by the Company; provided, however, that Aegis shall have the right to terminate the license granted in the event the Company does not pursue commercially reasonable efforts to exploit a Product.\nIf the Company\u2019s current or future licensees exercise termination rights they may have, or if these license agreements terminate because of delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, or for other reasons, and the Company is not able to establish replacement or additional research and development collaborations or licensing arrangements, the Company may not be able to develop and/or commercialize the Company\u2019s product candidates. Moreover, any future collaborations or license arrangements the Company may enter into may not be on terms favorable to the Company.\nA further risk the Company faces with the Company\u2019s collaborations is that business combinations and changes in the collaborator or their business strategy may adversely affect their willingness or ability to complete their obligations to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s current or any future collaborations or license arrangements ultimately may not be successful. The Company\u2019s agreements with collaborators typically allows them discretion in electing whether to pursue various development, regulatory, commercialization and other activities, such as the Adapt Agreement.\nIf any collaborator were to breach its agreement with the Company or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely or successful manner, the pre-clinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidate or research program would be delayed or terminated.\nOther risks associated with the Company\u2019s collaborative and contractual arrangements with others include the following:\n\u2022 the Company may not have day-to-day control over the activities of the Company\u2019s contractors or collaborators;\n\u2022 the Company\u2019s collaborators may fail to defend or enforce patents they own on compounds or technologies that are incorporated into the products the Company develops with them;\n\u2022 third parties may not fulfill their regulatory or other obligations; and\n\u2022 the Company may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements; and disagreements may arise regarding a breach of the arrangement, the interpretation of the agreement, ownership of proprietary rights, clinical results or regulatory approvals.\nThese factors could lead to delays in the development of the Company\u2019s product candidates and/or the commercialization of the Company\u2019s products or reduction in the milestone payments the Company receives from the Company\u2019s collaborators, or could result in the Company\u2019s not being able to commercialize the Company\u2019s products. Further, disagreements with the Company\u2019s contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. The Company\u2019s ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties. If the Company fails to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required, development of the Company\u2019s product candidates and/or the commercialization of the Company\u2019s products will be delayed or may never be realized.\nThe Company is exposed to product liability, non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon the Company, should lawsuits be filed against the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s business exposes the Company to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. The Company expects that such claims are likely to be asserted against the Company at some point. In addition, the use in the Company\u2019s clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by the Company or the Company\u2019s potential collaborators may cause the Company to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. Any claim under any existing insurance policies or any insurance policies secured in the future may be subject to certain exceptions, and may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all, and may not cover the full extent of liability the Company may actually face. Therefore, a successful liability claim or series of claims brought against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose the Company to liability, which would cause the Company\u2019s business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business, the Company collects and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, the Company\u2019s proprietary business information and that of the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of the Company\u2019s customers and employees, in the Company\u2019s data centers and on the Company\u2019s networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy. Despite the Company\u2019s security measures, the Company\u2019s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise the Company\u2019s networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and the products the Company provides to customers, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s products, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation of the Company\u2019s Industry\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell the Company\u2019s products profitably.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact the Company\u2019s ability to sell the Company\u2019s future products and profitability. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cPPACA\u201d), which includes a number of health care reform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. The new law, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require modification of business practices with health care practitioners.\nIn the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of the Company\u2019s future products, and the Company could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms.\nThe Company\u2019s industry and the Company are subject to intense regulation from the U.S. Government and such other governments and quasi-official regulatory bodies where the Company\u2019s products are and product candidates may be sold.\nBoth before and after regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, including the Company\u2019s product candidates, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping related to the product are subject to extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements and good clinical practice requirements for any clinical trials that the Company conduct post-approval. As a result, the Company is subject to a number of governmental and other regulatory risks, which include:\n\u2022 clinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process; delay and failure can occur at any stage of the Company\u2019s clinical trials;\n\u2022 the Company\u2019s clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment and regulatory approvals; the Company does not know whether the Company\u2019s planned trials will begin on time, or at all, or will be completed on schedule, or at all;\n\u2022 the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or may place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022 the Company relies on third parties, such as consultants, contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct clinical trials for the Company\u2019s drug candidates and if the Company or any of the Company\u2019s third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as cGCP requirements, the clinical data generated in the Company\u2019s clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require the Company to perform additional clinical trials;\n\u2022 if the clinical development process is completed successfully, the Company\u2019s ability to derive revenues from the sale of the Company\u2019s product candidates will depend on the Company\u2019s first obtaining FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory approvals, each of which are subject to unique risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022 there is no assurance that the Company will receive FDA or corollary foreign approval for any of the Company\u2019s product candidates for any indication; the Company is subject to government regulation for the commercialization of the Company\u2019s product candidates;\n\u2022 the Company has not received regulatory approval in the U.S. for the commercial sale of any of the Company\u2019s product candidates;\n\u2022 even if one or more of the Company\u2019s product candidates does obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve such product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than the Company requests, may not approve the price the Company intends to charge for the Company\u2019s products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate;\n\u2022 undesirable side effects caused by the Company\u2019s product candidates could cause the Company or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities;\n\u2022 later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with the Company\u2019s third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities could subject the Company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u2022 the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of the Company\u2019s drug candidates, and if the Company is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if the Company is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, the Company may lose any marketing approval that the Company may have obtained; and\n\u2022 the Company may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials used in the operations of the Company\u2019s business.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s operations are also subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws, including, without limitation:\n\u2022 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. This statute has been applied to pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be present, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u2022 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 Federal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations; and\n\u2022 State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe trading in the Company\u2019s shares is regulated by Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d or the \u201cSEC\u201d) and is subject to the \u201cPenny Stock\u201d rules. These rules may have the effect of reducing trading activity in the Company\u2019s stock and provide an illiquid market for the Company\u2019s securities.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s shares are currently traded at a price higher than $5.00, the Company\u2019s shares have frequently traded in the past at a price lower than $5.00. If the Company\u2019s share price goes below $5.00, the shares will be defined as a \u201cPenny Stock\u201d under the Exchange Act and rules of the Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in the Company\u2019s securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of the Company\u2019s securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company\u2019s Common Stock and may affect your ability to resell the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nThe Company will incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without revenue, the Company may not be able to remain in compliance, making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all.\nThe Company\u2019s shares are quoted on the OTCQB Market under the symbol \u201cOPNT.\u201d To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for the Company to remain in compliance, the Company will require cash to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s available cash resources. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance, it may be difficult for the Company\u2019s stockholders to resell any shares, if at all.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe Company\u2019s Common Stock is listed on the OTCQB Market under the symbol \u201cOPNT.\u201d The stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock has experienced substantial volatility and is likely to continue to be highly volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022 limited daily trading volume resulting in the lack of a liquid market;\n\u2022 fluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation and other factors that may not be tied to the financial performance of the Company;\n\u2022 performance by the Company in the execution of its business plan;\n\u2022 financial viability;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in the Company\u2019s operating results;\n\u2022 announcements of developments by the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022 market conditions in the Company\u2019s industry;\n\u2022 announcements by the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 adoption of new accounting standards affecting the Company\u2019s industry;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 introduction of new products by the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022 sales of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u2022 regulatory developments in both the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022 performance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;\n\u2022 economic and other external factors;\n\u2022 period-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and;\n\u2022 other events or factors, including the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe Company does not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nThe Company currently intends to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of the Company\u2019s business. Accordingly, the Company does not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy from time to time as circumstances dictate.\nThe Company may register an aggregate of at least 15,715 shares of Common Stock, at least 45,000 shares of Common Stock underlying warrants and at least 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock underlying options in the first half of 2017. The sales of such shares could depress the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nThe Company may register an aggregate of at least 15,715 shares of Common Stock, at least 45,000 shares of Common Stock underlying warrants and at least 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock underlying options under a registration statement on Form S-1 in the first half of 2017. Assuming 2,060,715 total shares were registered, it would represent approximately 101.94% of the Company\u2019s shares of Common Stock outstanding held by non-affiliates as of October 17, 2016, assuming that all the security holders exercised all of their warrants and options. The sale of these shares into the public market could depress the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s executive officers and directors control the direction of the Company\u2019s business by means of a significant collective ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock. The concentrated beneficial ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nDr. Roger Crystal, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and a director, Kevin Pollack, the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and a director, Dr. Michael Sinclair, the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and Geoffrey Wolf, a director, collectively beneficially own approximately 70.63% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock as of October 17, 2016. As a result, such executive officers and directors effectively control the Company and have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by the Company\u2019s stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with differing interests from such executive officers and directors.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under applicable law, the Company is subject to lessened disclosure requirements, which could leave the Company\u2019s stockholders without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nFor as long as the Company remains an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), the Company has elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d);\n\u2022 taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards;\n\u2022 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company\u2019s periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u2022 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nThe Company expects to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until the Company is no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nBecause the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d its financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nThe Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows the Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, the Company\u2019s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, and thus investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing the Company\u2019s business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nThe Company will incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance. Without significant revenue the Company may not be able to remain in compliance, making it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at all.\nThe Company\u2019s shares are quoted on the OTCQB Market under the symbol \u201cOPNT\u201d. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for the Company to remain in compliance, the Company will require cash to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s available cash resources. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance it may be difficult for the Company\u2019s stockholders to resell any shares, if at all.", "PERMNO": 16904, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "OPNT"}
