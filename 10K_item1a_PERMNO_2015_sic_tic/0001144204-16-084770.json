RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. There are a number of risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that are indicated by forward-looking statements. Some of the risks described relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate. Others relate principally to the securities market and ownership of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should also consider the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain.\nOur expenses have exceeded our revenue since our formation in 1987, and our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015 was $650 million. Our revenue for the last three fiscal years was $36.3 million in 2015, $30.7 million in 2014 and $20.9 million in 2013. Prior to 2011, we recorded limited revenue from research contracts, licenses and agreements to provide vaccine candidates, services and technologies. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in entering into strategic alliances or collaborative arrangements with other companies and government agencies that will result in significant revenue to offset our expenses. Our net losses for the last three fiscal years were $156.9 million in 2015, $82.9 million in 2014 and $52.0 million in 2013.\nOur recent historical losses have predominantly resulted from research and development expenses for our vaccine candidates, manufacturing-related expenses, costs related to protection of our intellectual property and for other general operating expenses. Our expenses have exceeded our revenue since inception and we believe our expenses will continue to increase, as a result of higher research and development efforts to support the development of our vaccine candidates. For example, we have experienced a significant increase in research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 over prior years primarily due to additional RSV F Vaccine clinical trials in the primary indications of older adult immunization and infants via maternal immunization, as well as higher employee-related costs to support product development of our RSV F Vaccine and other potential vaccine candidates.\nAlthough certain specified costs associated with the development of our influenza vaccines may be reimbursed under our contract with HHS BARDA, and to a more limited extent, certain specified costs associated with the development of our RSV maternal vaccine may be reimbursed under our contract with BMGF, nevertheless we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and anticipate that our losses will increase in the foreseeable future as we seek to:\n\u00b7 conduct clinical trials for RSV and RSV-influenza combination respiratory vaccine candidates;\n\u00b7 conduct preclinical studies for other vaccine candidates;\n\u00b7 comply with the FDA\u2019s manufacturing facility and compliance requirements in anticipation of commercialization;\n\u00b7 invest in our manufacturing process for commercial-scale and cost-efficiency; and\n\u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.\nAs a result, we expect our cumulative operating losses to increase until such time, if ever, that product sales, licensing fees, royalties, milestones, contract research and other sources generate sufficient revenue to fund our operations. We cannot predict when, if ever, we might achieve profitability and cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability, if achieved.\nWe have limited financial resources and we are not certain that we will be able to maintain our current level of operations or be able to fund the further development of our vaccine candidates.\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales, licensing fees, royalties, milestones, contract research or other sources in an amount sufficient to fully fund our operations for the foreseeable future, and we will therefore use our cash resources and expect to require additional funds to maintain our operations, continue our research and development programs, commence future preclinical studies and clinical trials, seek regulatory approvals and manufacture and market our products. We will seek such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative licensing and development arrangements, non-dilutive government contracts and grants and other sources. While we continue to apply for contracts or grants from academic institutions, non-profits and governmental entities, there are no assurances that we would be successful. We cannot be certain that adequate additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we cannot raise the additional funds required for our anticipated operations, we may be required to delay significantly, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, downsize our general and administrative infrastructure, or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency, including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or vaccine candidates. If we raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock or other securities, such offerings would cause dilution of current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in the Company, which could be substantial. Future offerings also could have a material and adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nEconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to execute our business plan as scheduled.\nGenerally, worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. Access to capital markets is critical to our ability to operate. Traditionally, biopharmaceutical companies have funded their research and development expenditures through raising capital in the equity markets. Declines and uncertainties in these markets in the past have severely restricted raising new capital and have affected companies\u2019 ability to continue to expand or fund existing research and development efforts. We require significant capital for research and development for our vaccine candidates and clinical trials. The general economic and capital market conditions, both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in the past and at times have adversely affected our access to capital and increased the cost of capital. There is no certainty that the capital and credit markets will be available to raise additional capital on favorable terms. If economic conditions become worse, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms, this could affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled. Moreover, we rely and intend to rely on third-parties, including our clinical research organizations and certain other important vendors and consultants. As a result of the global economic situation, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third-parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nEven with the Grant Agreement with BMGF, we may not be able to fully fund our RSV F Vaccine for infants via maternal immunization.\nThe Grant Agreement reimburses a portion of specified expenses associated with the development of our RSV F Vaccine for infants via maternal immunization and there is no guarantee that additional activities will not be needed and, if so, that BMGF will partially reimburse us for these activities.\nThe Grant Agreement with BMGF does not guarantee that we will be successful in future clinical trials associated with our RSV F Vaccine for infants via maternal immunization or that the vaccine candidate will be licensed by the FDA.\nThe Grant Agreement reimburses a portion of specified expenses associated with the development of our RSV F Vaccine for infants via maternal immunization, but we remain fully responsible for conducting these development activities. The Grant Agreement does not guarantee that any of these activities will be successful. Our inability to be successful with certain key clinical or development activities could jeopardize our ability to obtain FDA licensure to sell this vaccine.\nEven with the HHS BARDA contract award, we may not be able to fully fund our influenza programs.\nThe HHS BARDA contract is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract that only reimburses certain specified activities that have been previously authorized by HHS BARDA. There is no guarantee that additional activities will not be needed and, if so, that HHS BARDA will reimburse us for these activities. Performance under the HHS BARDA contract requires that we comply with appropriate regulations and operational mandates, which require us to engage internal and external expertise for compliance. Our ability to be regularly and fully reimbursed for our activities will depend on our ability to comply and demonstrate compliance with such requirements.\nThe HHS BARDA contract award does not guarantee that we will be successful in future clinical trials, that the vaccine candidates will be licensed by the FDA.\nThe HHS BARDA contract provides a cost-plus-fixed-fee reimbursement opportunity for certain specified clinical and development activities, but we remain fully responsible for conducting these approved activities. The award of the HHS BARDA contract does not guarantee that any of these activities will be successful. Our inability to be successful with certain key clinical or development activities could jeopardize our ability to obtain FDA licensure to sell our vaccines.\nHHS BARDA could decide to potentially delay certain of our activities, and we may elect to move forward with certain activities at our own risk and without HHS BARDA reimbursement.\nUnder the HHS BARDA contract, HHS BARDA regularly reviews our development efforts and clinical activities. Under certain circumstances, HHS BARDA may advise us to delay certain activities and invest additional time and resources before proceeding. If we follow such HHS BARDA advice, overall program delays and costs associated with additional resources for which we had not planned may result. Also, the costs associated with following such advice may or may not be reimbursed by HHS BARDA under our contract. Finally, we may decide not to follow the advice provided by HHS BARDA and instead pursue activities that we believe are in the best interest of the program and of the Company, even if HHS BARDA would not reimburse us under our contract.\nHHS BARDA may decide not to extend our contract beyond the exercised option period or may decide to terminate our contract.\nThe HHS BARDA contract was extended by an additional two years through the option period for a total performance period of approximately five and a half years. Depending on how we perform during the option period, HHS BARDA may decide whether or not to extend the contract to include additional periods of time to complete the contract deliverables or may decide to terminate the contract. For example, the HHS BARDA contract anticipates that we file BLAs for licensure of both our seasonal influenza vaccine and our pandemic influenza vaccine; however, there is no guarantee that we will successfully complete all of the tasks required to file BLAs during this period. There can be no guarantee that the HHS BARDA contract will not be terminated early or will be extended beyond September 2016.\nBecause of changes to the influenza vaccine industry and regulatory environment, we do not expect to seek accelerated approval by the FDA of our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate.\nFDA regulations allow for the accelerated approval of a seasonal influenza vaccine based on a surrogate endpoint (i.e., HAI data) when there is a shortage of vaccine because influenza is a serious and sometimes, life-threatening disease. This may allow developers to obtain licensure well ahead of the timeline for demonstrating clinical efficacy, which is necessary for traditional approval. However, the seasonal influenza vaccine industry has made significant steps to provide sufficient supply to the recommended population in the U.S., and thus, we no longer expect to seek accelerated approval from the FDA for our seasonal influenza vaccine. Because we do not expect such approval, it is likely that we would need to conduct larger and more expensive efficacy clinical trials and that licensure of our seasonal vaccine will be materially delayed for a year or more, assuming such licensure occurs at all, which may, in turn, delay the FDA approval of our pandemic vaccine.\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary Novavax AB, collaborations with regional partners, such as Cadila and BMGF, as well as contracts with international providers, expose us to additional risks associated with doing business outside the U.S., and any adverse event could have a material negative impact on our operations.\nSwedish-based Novavax AB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novavax, Inc. We have also formed a joint venture with Cadila in India, a clinical development agreement with BMGF and have entered into other agreements and arrangements with companies in other countries. We plan to continue to enter into collaborations or partnerships with companies, non-profit organizations and local governments in other parts of the world. Risks of conducting business outside the U.S. include:\n\u00b7 multiple regulatory requirements could affect our ability to develop, manufacture and sell products in such local markets;\n\u00b7 compliance with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 trade protections measures and import and export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 difficulties in and costs of staffing, managing and operating our international operations;\n\u00b7 changes in environmental, health and safety laws;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7 political instability and actual or anticipated military or potential conflicts;\n\u00b7 economic instability, inflation, recession and interest rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property; and\n\u00b7 possible nationalization and expropriation.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent or future regional relationships may hinder our ability to engage in larger transactions.\nWe have entered into regional collaborations to develop our vaccine candidates in certain parts of the world, and we may enter into additional regional collaborations. Our relationships with Cadila and BMGF are examples of these regional relationships. These relationships are likely to involve the licensing of our technology to our partner or entering into a distribution agreement, frequently on an exclusive basis. Generally, these exclusive agreements are restricted to certain territories. Because we have entered into exclusive license and distribution agreements, larger companies may not be interested, or able, to enter into collaborations with us on a worldwide-scale. Also, these regional relationships may make us an unattractive target for an acquisition.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company and face significant risk in developing, manufacturing and commercializing our products.\nWe focus our research and development activities on vaccines, an area in which we have particular strengths and a technology that appears promising. The outcome of any research and development program is highly uncertain. Only a small fraction of biopharmaceutical development programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates and a number of events could delay our development efforts and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to manufacture, market and sell, a vaccine. Vaccine candidates that initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products. In many cases, preclinical studies or clinical trials will show that a product candidate is not efficacious or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects that outweigh its intended benefit. Success in preclinical or early clinical trials may not translate into success in large-scale clinical trials. Further, success in clinical trials will likely lead to increased investment, accelerating cumulative losses to bring such products to market. Even if clinical trial results appear positive, regulatory approval may not be obtained if the FDA does not agree with our interpretation of the results and we may face challenges when scaling-up the production process to commercial levels. Even after a product is approved and launched, general usage or post-marketing clinical trials may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product, which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended, limited to narrow indications or revoked, which may otherwise prevent successful commercialization. Intense competition in the vaccine industry could also limit the successful commercialization of our products.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater resources and experience, which may negatively impact our commercial opportunities and those of our current and future licensees.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology firms, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise in:\n\u00b7 research and development;\n\u00b7 preclinical testing;\n\u00b7 designing and implementing clinical trials;\n\u00b7 regulatory processes and approvals;\n\u00b7 production and manufacturing; and\n\u00b7 sales and marketing of approved products.\nPrincipal competitive factors in our industry include:\n\u00b7 the quality and breadth of an organization\u2019s technology;\n\u00b7 management of the organization and the execution of the organization\u2019s strategy;\n\u00b7 the skill and experience of an organization\u2019s employees and its ability to recruit and retain skilled and experienced employees;\n\u00b7 an organization\u2019s intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 the range of capabilities, from target identification and validation to drug discovery and development to manufacturing and marketing; and\n\u00b7 the availability of substantial capital resources to fund discovery, development and commercialization activities.\nLarge and established companies, such as Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, CSL Ltd, Sanofi Pasteur, SA, Pfizer Inc. and MedImmune, LLC (a subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC), among others, compete in the vaccine market. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, manufacturing such products on a broad scale and marketing approved products.\nThere are many seasonal influenza vaccines currently approved and marketed. Competition in the sale of these seasonal influenza vaccines is intense. Therefore, newly developed and approved products must be differentiated from existing vaccines in order to have commercial success. In order to show differentiation in the seasonal influenza market, a product may need to be more efficacious, particularly in older adults, and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Many of our competitors are working on new products and new generations of current products, each of which is intended to be more efficacious than products currently being marketed. Our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate may not prove to be more efficacious than current products or products under development by our competitors. Further, our manufacturing system may not provide enough savings of time or money to provide the required differentiation for commercial success.\nWe are also aware that there are multiple companies with active RSV vaccine programs at various stages of development. Thus, while there is no RSV vaccine currently on the market, there is likely to be significant and consistent competition as these active programs mature. Different RSV vaccines may work better for different segments of the population, so it may be difficult for a single RSV vaccine manufacturer to provide vaccines that are marketable to multiple population segments. Geographic markets are also likely to vary significantly, which may make it difficult to market a single RSV vaccine worldwide. Even if a manufacturer brings an RSV vaccine to license, it is likely that competitors will continue to work on new products that could be more efficacious and/or less expensive. Our RSV vaccine candidate may not be as far along in development as other active RSV vaccine programs about which we are not aware, nor as efficacious as products under development by competing companies.\nWe believe that there are at least two EBOV vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in late stage clinical trials: one by GlaxoSmithKline in collaboration with the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the other by a collaboration of NewLink Genetics, Merck Vaccines USA and the Public Health Agency of Canada. Additional vaccine candidates are also being tested, although in earlier stage clinical trials. Vaccine candidates against EBOV have been in development for more than a decade by large pharmaceutical companies, smaller biotech companies, government agencies and academic labs worldwide, and with the high visibility of the recent West Africa epidemic, continued development activities are likely to continue and potentially increase.\nRegardless of the disease, smaller or early-stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical companies. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop proprietary positions, which may prevent or limit our product development and commercialization efforts. We will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials and in acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business. If any of our competitors succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do or for products that are more effective or less costly than ours, our commercial opportunity could be significantly reduced.\nIn order to effectively compete, we will have to make substantial investments in development, testing, manufacturing and sales and marketing or partner with one or more established companies. There is no assurance that we will be successful in gaining significant market share for any vaccine. Our technologies and vaccines also may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive as a result of products introduced by our competitors to the marketplace more rapidly and at a lower cost.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain key management or other personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on our senior executive officers, as well as key scientific and other personnel. The loss of these individuals could harm our business and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research, development or business objectives. We have had turnover situations in key executive positions and the lack of management continuity and resulting lack of long-term history with our Company along with the learning curve that executives experience when they join our management team could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs. If we were to experience additional turnover at the executive level, these risks could be exacerbated.\nWe may not be able to attract qualified individuals for other key management or other personnel positions on terms acceptable to us. Competition for qualified employees is intense among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion of our activities, could hinder our ability to complete clinical trials successfully and develop marketable products.\nWe also rely from time to time on outside advisors who assist us in formulating our research and development and clinical strategy. We may not be able to attract and retain these individuals on acceptable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have product liability exposure.\nThe administration of drugs or vaccines to humans, whether in clinical trials or after marketing clearances are obtained, can result in product liability claims. We maintain product liability insurance coverage in the total amount of $20 million aggregate for all claims arising from the use of products in clinical trials prior to FDA approval. Coverage is relatively expensive, and the market pricing can significantly fluctuate. Therefore, we may not be able to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain coverage for the use of our other products in the future. This insurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy all liabilities resulting from product liability claims. A successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable items, if at all. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a claim would be time-consuming and expensive, may damage our reputation in the marketplace and would likely divert management\u2019s attention.\nRegardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our products;\n\u00b7 impairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 costs of related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to subjects or other claimants;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue; and\n\u00b7 inability to commercialize our vaccine candidates.\nWe may not be able to win government, academic institution or non-profit contracts or grants.\nFrom time to time, we may apply for contracts or grants from government agencies, academic institutions, and non-profit entities. Such contracts or grants can be highly attractive because they provide capital to fund the ongoing development of our technologies and vaccine candidates without diluting our stockholders. However, there is often significant competition for these contracts or grants. Entities offering contracts or grants may have requirements to apply for or to otherwise be eligible to receive certain contracts or grants that our competitors may be able to satisfy that we cannot. In addition, such entities may make arbitrary decisions as to whether to offer contracts or make grants, to whom the contracts or grants will be awarded and the size of the contracts or grants to each awardee. Even if we are able to satisfy the award requirements, there is no guarantee that we will be a successful awardee. Therefore, we may not be able to win any contracts or grants in a timely manner, if at all.\nRaising additional capital by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or vaccine candidates.\nIf we are unable to partner with a third-party to advance the development of one or more of our vaccine candidates, we will need to raise money through additional debt or equity financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience immediate dilution, which may be significant. There is also a risk that such equity issuances may cause an ownership change under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions, thus limiting our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and credits. To the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that may not be favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or vaccine candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. In addition, current economic conditions may also negatively affect the desire or ability of potential collaborators to enter into transactions with us. They may also have to delay or cancel research and development projects or reduce their overall budgets.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our business development initiatives.\nWe anticipate growing through both internal development projects, as well as external opportunities, which include the acquisition, partnering and in-licensing of products, technologies and companies or the entry into strategic alliances and collaborations. The availability of high quality opportunities is limited, and we may fail to identify candidates that we and our stockholders consider suitable or complete transactions on terms that prove advantageous. In order to pursue such opportunities, we may require significant additional financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions, like our business combination with Novavax AB, we may not be able to integrate the assets or take full advantage of the opportunities and, consequently, may not realize the benefits that we expect.\nTo effectively manage our current and future potential growth, we will need to continue to enhance our operational, financial and management processes and to effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. Supporting our growth initiatives will require significant expenditures and management resources, including investments in research and development, manufacturing and other areas of our business. If we do not successfully manage our growth and do not successfully execute our growth initiatives, then our business and financial results may be adversely impacted, and we may incur asset impairment or restructuring charges.\nLitigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn addition to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we may be subject to other litigation. Regardless of the merits of any claims that may be brought against us, litigation could result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and we may be required to incur significant expenses defending against these claims. If we are unable to prevail in litigation, we could incur substantial liabilities. Where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that it is probable, we record a related liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate. However, because of uncertainties relating to litigation, the amount of our estimates could be wrong.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and data about our clinical subjects, suppliers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack by malicious third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chactivists,\u201d patient groups, disgruntled current or former employees, and others. Hacker attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached due to employee error or malfeasance. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Furthermore, if our systems become compromised, we may not promptly discover the intrusion. Like other companies in our industry, we have experienced attacks to our data and systems, including malware and computer viruses. Attacks could have a material impact on our business, operations or financial results. Any access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT RISKS\nBecause our vaccine product development efforts depend on new and rapidly evolving technologies, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be successful.\nOur vaccine development efforts depend on new, rapidly evolving technologies and on the marketability and profitability of our products. Our development efforts and, if those are successful, commercialization of our vaccines could fail for a variety of reasons, and include the possibility that:\n\u00b7 our recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technologies, any or all of the products based on such technologies or our proprietary manufacturing process will be ineffective or unsafe, or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances or commercial viability;\n\u00b7 we are unable to scale-up our manufacturing capabilities in a cost-effective manner;\n\u00b7 the products, if safe and effective, will be difficult to manufacture on a large-scale or uneconomical to market;\n\u00b7 our manufacturing facility will fail to continue to pass regulatory inspections;\n\u00b7 proprietary rights of third-parties will prevent us or our collaborators from exploiting technologies, and manufacturing or marketing products; and\n\u00b7 third-party competitors will gain greater market share due to superior products or marketing capabilities.\nWe have not completed the development of vaccine products and we may not succeed in obtaining the FDA licensure necessary to sell such vaccine products.\nThe development, manufacture and marketing of our pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to government regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including the European Medicines Agency and the Swedish Medical Products Agency with respect to our adjuvant product being developed in Sweden. In the U.S. and most foreign countries, we must complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product. None of our vaccine candidates have yet gained regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere. We also have vaccine candidates in clinical trials and preclinical laboratory or animal studies.\nThe steps generally required by the FDA before our proposed investigational products may be marketed in the U.S. include:\n\u00b7 performance of preclinical (animal and laboratory) tests;\n\u00b7 submissions to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may commence;\n\u00b7 performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product in the intended target population;\n\u00b7 performance of a consistent and reproducible manufacturing process intended for commercial use, including appropriate manufacturing data and regulatory inspections;\n\u00b7 submission to the FDA of a BLA or a NDA; and\n\u00b7 FDA approval of the BLA or NDA before any commercial sale or shipment of the product.\nThe processes are expensive and can take many years to complete, and we may not be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our vaccine candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities. The start of clinical trials can be delayed or take longer than anticipated for many and varied reasons, many of which are out of our control. Safety concerns may emerge that could lengthen the ongoing clinical trials or require additional clinical trials to be conducted. Promising results in early clinical trials may not be replicated in subsequent clinical trials. Regulatory authorities may also require additional testing, and we may be required to demonstrate that our proposed products represent an improved form of treatment over existing therapies, which we may be unable to do without conducting further clinical trials. Moreover, if the FDA or a foreign regulatory body grants regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to its distribution. Expanded or additional indications for approved products may not be approved, which could limit our revenue. Foreign regulatory authorities may apply similar limitations or may refuse to grant any approval. Consequently, even if we believe that preclinical and clinical data are sufficient to support regulatory approval for our vaccine candidates, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not ultimately grant approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction. If our vaccine candidates are not approved, our ability to generate revenue will be limited and our business will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our vaccines in sufficient quantities, at sufficient yields or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for a manufacturing facility for our vaccines, we may experience delays in product development, clinical trials, regulatory approval and commercial distribution.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our vaccine candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture our vaccine candidates at sufficient yields and at commercial-scale. We have limited experience manufacturing any of our vaccine candidates in the volumes that will be necessary to support large-scale clinical trials or commercial sales. Efforts to establish these capabilities may not meet initial expectations as to scheduling, scale-up, reproducibility, yield, purity, cost, potency or quality.\nManufacturing our vaccine candidates involves a complicated process with which we have limited experience. If we are unable to manufacture our vaccine candidates in clinical quantities or, when necessary, in commercial quantities and at sufficient yields, then we must rely on third-parties. Other third-party manufacturers must also receive FDA approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial products. Our vaccines may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third-parties give other products greater priority. We may not be able to enter into any necessary third-party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms, or on a timely basis. In addition, we have to enter into technical transfer agreements and share our know-how with the third-party manufacturers, which can be time-consuming and may result in delays.\nInfluenza vaccines are seasonal in nature. If a vaccine is not available early enough in the influenza season, we would likely have difficulty selling the vaccine. Further, pandemic outbreaks present only short-term opportunities for us. There is no way to predict when there will be a pandemic outbreak, the strain of the influenza or how long the pandemic will last. For these reasons, any delay in the delivery of an influenza vaccine could result in lower sales volumes, lower sale prices, or no sales. Because the strain of the seasonal influenza changes annually, inventory of seasonal vaccine cannot be sold during a subsequent influenza season. Any delay in the manufacture of our influenza vaccines could adversely affect our ability to sell the vaccines.\nOur reliance on contract manufacturers may adversely affect our operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control. Because of contractual restraints and the limited number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our bulk vaccines on a commercial-scale, replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and time-consuming and may cause interruptions in the production of our vaccine. A third-party manufacturer may also encounter difficulties in production. These problems may include:\n\u00b7 difficulties with production costs, scale up and yields;\n\u00b7 availability of raw materials and supplies;\n\u00b7 quality control and assurance;\n\u00b7 shortages of qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations that vary in each country where product might be sold; and\n\u00b7 lack of capital funding.\nAs a result, any delay or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must identify vaccines for development with our technologies and establish successful third-party relationships.\nThe near and long-term viability of our vaccine candidates will depend in part on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies. Establishing strategic collaborations and obtaining government funding is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or based on their internal pipeline; government agencies may reject contract or grant applications based on their assessment of public need, the public interest, our products\u2019 ability to address these areas, or other reasons beyond our expectations or control. If we fail to establish a sufficient number of collaborations or government relationships on acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our vaccine candidates or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts.\nEven if we establish new collaborations or obtain government funding, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any vaccine candidates for several reasons, including the fact that:\n\u00b7 we may not have the ability to control the activities of our partners and cannot provide assurance that they will fulfill their obligations to us, including with respect to the license, development and commercialization of vaccine candidates, in a timely manner or at all;\n\u00b7 such partners may not devote sufficient resources to our vaccine candidates or properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 any failure on the part of our partners to perform or satisfy their obligations to us could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of our vaccine candidates and affect our ability to realize product revenue; and\n\u00b7 disagreements, including disputes over the ownership of technology developed with such collaborators, could result in litigation, which would be time consuming and expensive, and may delay or terminate research and development efforts, regulatory approvals and commercialization activities.\nOur collaborators will be subject to the same regulatory approval of their manufacturing facility and process as Novavax. Before we could begin commercial manufacturing of any of our vaccine candidates, we and our collaborators must pass a pre-approval inspection before FDA approval and comply with the FDA\u2019s GMP regulations. If our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements, our vaccine candidates would not be approved. If our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements after approval, we could be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products.\nIf we or our collaborators fail to maintain our existing agreements or in the event we fail to establish agreements as necessary, we could be required to undertake research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities solely at our own expense. These activities would significantly increase our capital requirements and, given our lack of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, significantly delay the commercialization of our vaccine candidates.\nBecause we depend on third-parties to conduct some of our laboratory testing, clinical trials, and manufacturing, we may encounter delays in or lose some control over our efforts to develop products.\nWe are dependent on third-party research organizations to conduct some of our laboratory testing, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. If we are unable to obtain any necessary services on acceptable terms, we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner. We may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties. These third-parties may not complete testing or manufacturing activities on schedule, within budget, or when we request. We may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research organizations to conduct our laboratory testing, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. We have not manufactured any of our vaccine candidates at a commercial level and may need to identify additional third-party manufacturers to scale-up and manufacture our products.\nWe are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the clinical trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies also require us to comply with good manufacturing practices. Our reliance on third-parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third-parties may not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines. In addition, these third-parties may need to be replaced or the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain may be compromised or the product they manufacture may be contaminated due to the failure to adhere to our clinical and manufacturing protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons. In any such event, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of, or commercially manufacture, our vaccine candidates.\nEven if licensed to market, our vaccine products may not be initially or ever profitable.\nWhether Novavax makes a profit from the sale of its vaccine products is dependent on a number of variables, including the costs we incur manufacturing, testing and releasing, packaging and shipping such vaccine product. The Grant Agreement with BMGF necessitates that we commit to a specific amount of sales in certain specified middle and lower income countries, which may impact our ability to make profits. In addition, we have not yet determined pricing for our vaccine products, which is a complicated undertaking that necessitates both regulatory agency and payor support. We cannot predict when, if at all, our approved vaccine products will be profitable to the Company.\nOur collaborations may not be profitable.\nWe formed CPLB with Cadila in India and, in connection with it, entered into a master services agreement pursuant to which we may request certain services from Cadila in the areas of biologics research, preclinical development, clinical development, process development, manufacturing scale-up and general manufacturing related services in India. We cannot predict when, if at all, this relationship will lead to approved products, sales, or otherwise provide revenue to the Company or become profitable.\nWe have limited marketing capabilities, and if we are unable to enter into collaborations with marketing partners or develop our own sales and marketing capability, we may not be successful in commercializing any approved products.\nAlthough we have initiated preliminary activities in anticipation of commercialization of our vaccine candidates, we currently have no dedicated sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. As a result, we will depend on collaborations with third-parties that have established distribution systems and sales forces. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other licensing arrangements, our revenue will depend upon the efforts of third-parties, over which we may have little or no control. If we are unable to reach and maintain agreements with one or more pharmaceutical companies or collaborators, we may be required to market our products directly. Developing a marketing and sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay a product launch. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain qualified sales personnel or otherwise develop this capability.\nOur vaccine candidates may never achieve market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approvals.\nEven if we receive regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our vaccine candidates, the commercial success of these vaccine candidates will depend on, among other things, their acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers, such as health insurance companies and other members of the medical community, as a vaccine and cost-effective alternative to competing products. If our vaccine candidates fail to gain market acceptance, we may be unable to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business. Market acceptance of, and demand for, any product that we may develop and commercialize will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u00b7 whether our vaccines are differentiated from other vaccines based on immunogenicity;\n\u00b7 availability, relative cost and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution strategy;\n\u00b7 publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIn particular, there are significant challenges to market acceptance for seasonal influenza vaccines. For our seasonal vaccine to be accepted in the market, we must demonstrate differentiation from other seasonal vaccines that are currently approved and marketed. This can mean that the vaccine is more effective in certain populations, such as in older adults, or cheaper and quicker to produce. There are no assurances that our vaccine will be more efficacious than other vaccines.\nIf our vaccine candidates do not become widely accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payers and other members of the medical community, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to secure sufficient supplies of a key component of our adjuvant technology.\nBecause an important component of our adjuvant technology is extracted from a species of soap-bark tree ( Quillaja saponaria ) grown in Chile, we need long term access to quillaja extract with a consistent and sufficiently high quality. We need a secure supply of raw material, as well as back-up suppliers, or our adjuvant products may be delayed.\nIf reforms in the health care industry make reimbursement for our potential products less likely, the market for our potential products will be reduced, and we could lose potential sources of revenue.\nOur success may depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of vaccines will be available from third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed care programs and other organizations. Over the past decade, the cost of health care has risen significantly, and there have been numerous proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party health care payers to curb these costs. Some of these proposals have involved limitations on the amount of reimbursement for certain products. Similar federal or state health care legislation may be adopted in the future and any products that we or our collaborators seek to commercialize may not be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party insurance coverage may not be available for us to establish and maintain price levels that are sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Moreover, the existence or threat of cost control measures could cause our corporate collaborators to be less willing or able to pursue research and development programs related to our vaccine candidates.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nWe may fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products on a timely basis or comply with our continuing regulatory obligations after approval is obtained.\nDelays in obtaining regulatory approval can be extremely costly in terms of lost sales opportunities, loss of any potential marketing advantage of being early to market and increased clinical trial costs. The speed with which we begin and complete our preclinical studies necessary to begin clinical trials, clinical trials and our applications for marketing approval will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 our ability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials for use in necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 prior regulatory agency review and approval;\n\u00b7 approval of the protocol and the informed consent form by the review board of the institution conducting the clinical trial;\n\u00b7 the rate of subject or patient enrollment and retention, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the subject or patient population, the proximity of subjects and patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial and the nature of the protocol;\n\u00b7 negative test results or side effects experienced by clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities, which are susceptible to varying interpretations and which interpretations could delay, limit or prevent further studies or regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 the availability of skilled and experienced staff to conduct and monitor clinical trials and to prepare the appropriate regulatory applications; and\n\u00b7 changes in the policies of regulatory authorities for drug or vaccine approval during the period of product development.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory marketing approvals. We may not be permitted to continue or commence additional clinical trials. We also face the risk that the results of our clinical trials may be inconsistent with the results obtained in preclinical studies or clinical trials of similar products or that the results obtained in later phases of clinical trials may be inconsistent with those obtained in earlier phases. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical and product development industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after experiencing promising results in early animal and human testing.\nRegulatory agencies may require us or our collaborators to delay, restrict or discontinue clinical trials on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, we or our collaborators may be unable to submit applications to regulatory agencies within the time frame we currently expect. Once submitted, applications must be approved by various regulatory agencies before we or our collaborators can commercialize the product described in the application. All statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the future, which could affect the cost of such clinical trials. Any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical trials could delay our ability to generate revenue and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products internationally.\nWe intend to have our vaccine candidates marketed outside the U.S. In furtherance of this objective, we have entered into relationships with Cadila in India. In order to market our products in the European Union, India, Asia and many other non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and data review. The time required to obtain foreign regulatory approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by a regulatory agency, such as the FDA, does not ensure approval by any other regulatory agencies, for example in other foreign countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions, including approval by the FDA. The failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions could harm our business.\nEven if regulatory approval is received for our vaccine candidates, the later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions, including withdrawal of the product from the market.\nEven if a product gains regulatory approval, such approval is likely to limit the indicated uses for which it may be marketed, and the product and the manufacturer of the product will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including adverse event reporting requirements and the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved uses. Failure to comply with any post-approval requirements can, among other things, result in warning letters, product seizures, recalls, substantial fines, injunctions, suspensions or revocations of marketing licenses, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these enforcement actions, any unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements, or any safety issues that arise with any approved products, could adversely affect our ability to market products and generate revenue and thus adversely affect our ability to continue our business.\nWe also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product, even after obtaining product approval, if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture are subsequently discovered and we cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following any regulatory approval. With the use of any vaccine by a wide patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the vaccine itself, and only if the specific event occurs with some regularity over a period of time does the vaccine become suspect as having a causal relationship to the adverse event. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products, possibly subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition.\nBecause we are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, we may be unable to conduct our business in the most advantageous manner.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, emissions and wastewater discharges, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research, including infectious disease agents. We also cannot accurately predict the extent of regulations that might result from any future legislative or administrative action. Any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations.\nOur facilities in Maryland are subject to various local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including chemicals, microorganisms and various hazardous compounds used in connection with our research and development activities. In the U.S., these laws include the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Test Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Similar national and local regulations govern our facility in Sweden. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or injury from these materials. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, these hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third-parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.\nAlthough we have general liability insurance, these policies contain exclusions from insurance against claims arising from pollution from chemicals or pollution from conditions arising from our operations. Our collaborators are working with these types of hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, we could be held responsible for any injury we or our collaborators cause to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, any hazardous materials. However, we believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental and occupational health and safety regulations.\nEven if we successfully commercialize any of our vaccine candidates, either alone or in collaboration, we face uncertainty with respect to pricing, third-party reimbursement and healthcare reform, all of which could adversely affect any commercial success of our vaccine candidates.\nOur ability to collect revenue from the commercial sale of our vaccines may depend on our ability, and that of any current or potential future collaboration partners or customers, to obtain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for such products from third-party payers such as:\n\u00b7 government health administration authorities;\n\u00b7 private health insurers;\n\u00b7 health maintenance organizations;\n\u00b7 pharmacy benefit management companies; and\n\u00b7 other healthcare related organizations.\nThird-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and may deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed product has not received appropriate clearances from the FDA, or foreign equivalent, or other government regulators, is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the third-party payer, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Prices could also be driven down by health maintenance organizations that control or significantly influence purchases of healthcare products.\nIn both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell vaccines. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced reimbursement rates for medical products, and while we have no current vaccines available for commercial sale, the impact of such reform could nevertheless adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law a legislative overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system, known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cPPACA\u201d). As a result of this new legislation, substantial changes could be made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the United States, including changes made in order to extend medical benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage. The long-term ramifications of PPACA remain unclear and many details regarding implementation of PPACA are yet to be determined, however, the cost-containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting and the results of healthcare reforms may negatively impact the commercial prospects of one or more of our vaccine candidates currently in development.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.\nOur success in large part depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets. To do so, we must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and pursue trade secret and other intellectual property protection. We also must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third-parties or allowing third-parties to infringe our rights. We currently have or have rights to over 200 U.S. patents and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications covering our technologies. However, patent issues relating to pharmaceuticals and biologics involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. To date, no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of biotechnology patent claims that are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or enforced by the federal courts. Therefore, we do not know whether our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, or that any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot be sure that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable. Furthermore, there is a risk that others will independently develop or duplicate similar technology or products or circumvent the patents issued to us.\nThere is a risk that third-parties may challenge our existing patents or claim that we are infringing their patents or proprietary rights. We could incur substantial costs in defending patent infringement suits or in filing suits against others to have their patents declared invalid or claim infringement. It is also possible that we may be required to obtain licenses from third-parties to avoid infringing third-party patents or other proprietary rights. We cannot be sure that such third-party licenses would be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain required third-party licenses, we may be delayed in or prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling products requiring such licenses.\nAlthough our patent filings include claims covering various features of our vaccine candidates, including composition, methods of manufacture and use, our patents do not provide us with complete protection against the development of competing products. Some of our know-how and technology is not patentable. To protect our proprietary rights in unpatentable intellectual property and trade secrets, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information.\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, including any vaccine candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents owned by third-parties and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights. There may be rights we are not aware of, including applications that have been filed, but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third-parties could bring claims against us, and that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third-party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also impact our collaborators, which would also impact the success of the collaboration and therefore us.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology.\nWe may become involved in litigation to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to counter infringement for unauthorized use. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at the risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. We may not be able, alone or with our collaborators and licensors, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the U.S.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third-parties and, if our right to use the intellectual property we license is affected, our ability to develop and commercialize our vaccine candidates may be harmed.\nWe expect that we will need to license intellectual property from third-parties in the future and that these licenses will be material to our business. We will not own the patents or patent applications that underlie these licenses, and we will not control the enforcement of the patents. We will rely upon our licensors to properly prosecute and file those patent applications and prevent infringement of those patents.\nOur license agreement with Wyeth, which gives us rights to a family of patents and patent applications that are expected to expire in early 2022, covering VLP technology for use in human vaccines in certain fields of use, is non-exclusive. These applications are very significant to our business. If each milestone is achieved for any particular vaccine candidate, we would likely be obligated to pay an aggregate of $15 million to Wyeth for each vaccine candidate developed and commercialized under the agreement. Achievement of each milestone is subject to many risks, including those described in these risk factors. Annual license fees under the Wyeth agreement aggregate to $0.3 million per year. In September 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Wyeth. Among other things, the amendment restructured the $3 million milestone payment owed as a result of CPLB\u2019s initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial for its recombinant trivalent seasonal VLP influenza vaccine candidate in 2014. Under the amendment, the milestone payment, which may increase slightly over time, shall be due in connection with the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial for the initial seasonal influenza VLP vaccine candidate being developed outside India, but in any case no later than December 31, 2017.\nWhile many of the licenses under which we have rights provide us with rights in specified fields, the scope of our rights under these and other licenses may be subject to dispute by our licensors or third-parties. In addition, our rights to use these technologies and practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not terminating them. Any of our licenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in breach of a term or condition of the license agreement, or in certain other circumstances.\nOur vaccine candidates and potential vaccine candidates will require several components that may each be the subject of a license agreement. The cumulative license fees and royalties for these components may make the commercialization of these vaccine candidates uneconomical.\nIf patent laws or the interpretation of patent laws change, our competitors may be able to develop and commercialize our discoveries.\nImportant legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biopharmaceutical products and processes in the U.S. and other important markets outside the U.S., such as Europe and Japan. In addition, foreign markets may not provide the same level of patent protection as provided under the U.S. patent system. Litigation or administrative proceedings may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of certain of our and others\u2019 proprietary rights. Any such litigation or proceeding may result in a significant commitment of resources in the future and could force us to do one or more of the following: cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue; obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and redesign our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third-parties, which may be time-consuming or impossible to do. In addition, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may result in patent laws that allow others to use our discoveries or develop and commercialize our products. We cannot provide assurance that the patents we obtain or the unpatented technology we hold will afford us significant commercial protection.\nRisks Related to OUR Convertible SENIOR Notes\nServicing our 3.75% convertible senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow to pay our debt.\nIn 2016, we issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We do not expect our business to be able to generate cash flow from operations, in the foreseeable future, sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and may therefore be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness, which is non-callable and matures in 2023, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for repurchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions in our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes.\nCapped call transactions entered into in connection with our Notes may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with our Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the \u201ccapped call transactions\u201d) with certain financial institutions. The capped call transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, these financial institutions or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or to purchase our common stock. The financial institutions, or their respective affiliates, may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect the value of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nBecause our stock price has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile, the market price of our common stock may be lower or more volatile than expected.\nOur stock price has been highly volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the closing sale price of our common stock has been as low as $5.74 per share and as high as $14.14 per share. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 future announcements about us or our collaborators or competitors, including the results of testing, technological innovations or new commercial products;\n\u00b7 clinical trial results;\n\u00b7 depletion of our cash reserves;\n\u00b7 sale of equity securities or issuance of additional debt;\n\u00b7 announcement by us of significant strategic partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, capital commitments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 changes in government regulations;\n\u00b7 impact of competitor successes and in particular development success of vaccine candidates that compete with our own vaccine candidates;\n\u00b7 developments in our relationships with our collaboration partners;\n\u00b7 announcements relating to health care reform and reimbursement levels for new vaccines and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of accuracy;\n\u00b7 sales of substantial amounts of our stock by existing stockholders (including stock by insiders or 5% stockholders);\n\u00b7 development, spread or new announcements related to pandemic influenza;\n\u00b7 litigation;\n\u00b7 public concern as to the safety of our products;\n\u00b7 significant set-backs or concerns with the industry or the market as a whole;\n\u00b7 regulatory inquiries, reviews and potential action, including from the FDA or the SEC;\n\u00b7 recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates; and\n\u00b7 the other factors described in this Risk Factors section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for emerging and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many of those companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be lower or more volatile than expected.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware law could delay or prevent the acquisition of the Company, even if such acquisition would be beneficial to stockholders, and could impede changes in our Board.\nProvisions in our organizational documents could hamper a third-party\u2019s attempt to acquire, or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire control of, the Company. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Our organizational documents also could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for our securities and make it more difficult to change the composition of our Board in any one year. Certain provisions include the right of the existence of a staggered board with three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms and advance notice requirements for stockholders to nominate directors and make proposals.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless advance board or stockholder approval was obtained.\nAny delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our earnings for use in the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock would be the only source of gain for stockholders until dividends are paid, if at all.", "PERMNO": 82779, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NVAX"}
