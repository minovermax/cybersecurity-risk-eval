{"cik": "721447", "company": "CCA INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nConcentration of Risk.\nThe Company relies on mass merchandisers and major food and drug chains for the sales of its products. The loss of any one of those accounts or substantial reduction of sales revenues realized from their business could have a material negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations. All of the Company\u2019s products have independent and substantial competition and must be able to effectively compete in order to maintain the Company's position on the retail merchandisers\u2019 shelves. (See Business, Item 1 (c) Marketing.)\nWe are Dependent on Independent Contract Manufacturers.\nThe Company does not manufacture any of its products. All of the products are manufactured for the Company by independent contract manufacturers. There can be no assurance that these independent contract manufacturers will manufacture our products in time, in accordance with our specifications or at the level of quality expected. There can be no assurance that the failure of a supplier to deliver the products ordered by the Company, when requested, will not cause burdensome delays in the Company\u2019s shipments to its customers. The Company does constantly seek alternative suppliers in order to reduce costs and to have alternatives should a major supplier fail to deliver as contracted. A failure of the Company to ship as ordered by its customers could cause penalties and/or cancellations of our customers\u2019 orders. In addition, an unanticipated need to transition to a new supplier could result in delays that could impact timely distribution of our products. Any of the foregoing events, depending upon the timing and particular circumstances, could have a material adverse impact on our relationships with our customers and our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nThere is No Assurance That The Business Will Be Able to Maintain or Increase Net Sales.\nIn fiscal 2017, net sales were $19,813,262 with net income of $1,831,181. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s existing products or any new products introduced into the marketplace will be successful.\nWe may experience periods of declines in sales, especially during periods of economic downturn, and any material reduction in our sales could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nWe depend on our existing credit facility, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory.\nOn February 5, 2018, the Company entered into the Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with PNC Bank, National Association (\"PNC\"). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan in an amount of $1,500,000 (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $4,500,000 (the \u201cRevolving Loan\u201d and together with the Term Loan, the \u201cLoans\u201d). The Loans and all other amounts due and owing under the Credit Agreement and related documents are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in, and lien on, substantially all of the assets of the Company. Amounts available for borrowing under the Revolving Loan equal the lesser of the Borrowing Base (as defined below), and $4,500,000, in each case, as the same is reduced by the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Loan. \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d under the Credit Agreement means, generally, the amount equal to (i) 85% of the Company\u2019s eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) 65% of the value of eligible inventory, less (iii) certain reserves. If the Company does not have sufficient eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement may be reduced. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants on the part of the Company, including a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.10 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also provides for events of default, including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, PNC may elect to declare the entire unpaid principal balance of the Loans to be immediately due and payable, together with interest and all costs incurred by PNC under the Credit Agreement. See Financial Statements, Note 19 - Subsequent Events for further information relating to the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company is Dependent on Outsourced Core Function Vendors\nThe Company has outsourcing agreements with the Advantage Sales and Marketing, which includes sales, customer service and accounts receivable collection functions, and Casestack for warehousing and shipping functions. While there are other vendors that provide these services, which could be sought as alternative vendors, any disruption in our sales, shipments, collections or any other core outsourced function, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and business.\nThe Fast Moving Consumer Goods Segment is Highly Competitive.\nThe market for cosmetics and perfumes, and health-and-beauty aids products in general, including patent medicines, is characterized by vigorous competition among producers, many of whom have substantially greater financial, technological and marketing resources than the Company. Major competitors such as Revlon, L\u2019Oreal, Colgate-Palmolive, Coty, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble have the broadest-based public recognition of their products and are significantly larger than the Company. Moreover, a substantial number of other health-and-beauty aids manufacturers and distributors have greater resources than the Company and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on research and development, advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. Our inability to successfully compete with our competitors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operation and business.\nOur Class A Shareholder Retains Control of Board of Directors.\nOur Class A Shareholder, Capital Preservation Holdings, LLC has the right to elect four members to the Board of Directors. Capital Preservation Holdings, LLC is controlled by Lance Funston, the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and as a result, Mr. Funston is able to exert significant influence over our business. The holders of our Common Stock have the right to elect three members to the Board of Directors.\nFuture Success Depends on Continued Success of the Company\u2019s Current Products and New Product Development.\nThe Company is not financially as strong as the major companies against whom it competes. The ability to successfully introduce new niche products and increase the growth and profitability of its current and new niche brand products will affect the business and prospects of the future of the Company and this ability is dependent upon the creativity and marketing skills of management and its advisors and business partners.\nAll of the Company\u2019s product must be in compliance with all FDA and state regulations and all products which are being manufactured for the Company by outside suppliers must conform to the FDA\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practices requirements. It is the Company\u2019s responsibility to ascertain that the suppliers conform with these requirements. Damage could be caused to our reputation and our relationships with our customers and consumers if our products do not comply with such legal requirements, or with consumer expectations, which could result in diminished sales or liability claims, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nThe Company Relies On A Few Large Customers For A Significant Portion Of Its Sales.\nIn fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. represented 36.3% and 38.7%of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company\u2019s three largest customers accounted for 56.6% of the Company\u2019s net sales in fiscal 2017. The Company has no agreements with any of its customers to stock its products. The Company\u2019s business would suffer materially if it lost Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or Walgreens, Inc. as a customer. Any significant reduction in sales to any of the Company\u2019s three top customers could likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Price of the Company\u2019s Stock May Be Volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock could fluctuate substantially. There is a limited float of shares tradable. There are factors beyond the Company\u2019s control which may cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate significantly, including\nbut not limited to the volatility of small cap stocks in general, general stock market conditions, and general economic variations. In addition, variations in the Company\u2019s operating revenues and profits and the timing of advertising commitments may have a material effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe Company May Experience Interruptions to Its Business Operations Due to Events Beyond Its Control.\nA catastrophic event beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as a natural disaster, health pandemic, cyber-attack, adverse weather event or act of terrorism, that results in the destruction or disruption of any of the Company\u2019s critical business systems or operations could harm its ability to conduct normal business operations and its operating results.\nWe Depend on Key Personnel.\nOur employees are key to the growth and success of our business. This depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including our executive officers and key management personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe Future Growth of the Company Depends on an Effective Marketing Program.\nAn effective marketing program includes media advertising, in-store merchandising, enhancing distribution, co-operative advertising with our retail partners and product promotions that increase product availability, awareness, and help generate increased sales for our customers. Our inability to develop and implement an effective advertising campaign, marketing or promotional programs, that will succeed in a difficult economic environment and highly competitive marketplace, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Sell to International Accounts.\nIn fiscal 2017, international sales accounted for approximately 12.4% of our total net sales. Our international sales expose the Company to additional risks associated with political or regulatory conditions, the dependence on other economies and foreign currency fluctuations which may diminish demand for U.S. goods and subject us to adverse translation impact. A terrorist attack, the threat of a terrorist attack or foreign military operations or other catastrophic event beyond the Company's control could prevent us from shipping to our international accounts. A loss of or material reduction in our international sales would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSome Raw Materials or Components Used in our Products are Sourced from International Suppliers.\nSome of the components used in our products are sourced from international suppliers either by the Company directly or through our outside contract manufacturers. This exposes the Company to an additional risk of increased costs if the foreign currency exchange rates change unfavorably. A terrorist attack, the threat of a terrorist attack or foreign military operations or other catastrophic event beyond the Company's control could prevent the international suppliers from delivering their goods to the Company or contract manufacturers. The interruption of the supply could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Have Entered into Employment and Change of Control Agreements that would Require Us to Make Substantial Payments in connection with a Change of Control of the Company.\nThe Company has entered into an Employment Agreement with Stephen A. Heit, the Company's Chief Financial Officer (\"the Executive\"). The Employment Agreement may, in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances or a change of control of the Company, result in a lump sum payment equal to three times the Executive\u2019s base annual salary and prior year bonus plus other benefits. In addition, the Company has entered into a severance agreements with Douglas Haas, the Company's President and an employment agreement with one other employee, who is not a named officer, which provide that in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances or a change of control of the Company, Mr. Haas or the other employee who is not a named officer, as applicable, will be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to one times his base annual salary and prior year bonus plus other benefits.For further information, see Part III, Section 11, Executive Compensation. If the Company was required\nto make a substantial payment under any of these agreements, there would be a significant impact to the Company's cash reserves and earnings. For further information, see Part III, Section 11, Executive Compensation.\nThe Company May Not be Able to Fully Realize its Deferred Tax Assets.\nThe amounts recognized in the deferred tax asset are management's best estimate of the amount more likely than not to be realized and the actual results could differ from those estimates. In determining the amount more likely than not to be realized, management considered available information and determined the negative objective evidence, primarily recent losses offset by positive objective evidence, including forecasts for future profitability. Future profitability in this competitive industry depends on the successful execution of management's initiatives designed to obtain sales levels and improve operating results. The inability to successfully execute these initiatives could reduce estimates of future profitability, which could affect the Company's ability to realize the deferred tax assets. In addition, changes to future tax rates can also affect the value of the deferred tax assets. The enactment by the United States Government of public law 115-97, an Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018 (formerly known as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017) provides for a lower corporate tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2018. This will result in a revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and is likely to result in a substantial reduction of value.\nOur Business and Operations Would be Adversely Impacted in the Event of a Failure of Our Information Technology Infrastructure and/or Cyber Security Attacks.\nCyber security failure might be caused by computer hacking, malware, computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, \"cyber-attacks\" and other malicious activity. Such events could have an adverse impact on our business, including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential information or intellectual property. Operational or business delays may result from the disruption of network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities. In addition, the networks and information systems of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to the events described above. The Company outsources its order processing , invoicing and accounts receivable collection to Advantage Sales and Marketing, and is dependent on their maintaining adequate security of their computer systems, hardware and software. The Company also outsources management of the computer hardware, software and network used by its employees to a third party information technology firm. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against these events or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, caused by these events or the failure or inadequacy of our security systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 21785, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "CAWW"}
