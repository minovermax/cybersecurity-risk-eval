Future economic uncertainty may reduce the availability of liquidity and credit and, in many cases, reduce demand for our customers\u2019 products. Disruption of the credit markets could also adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to finance on-going maintenance and new capital projects, resulting in contract cancellations or suspensions, and capital project delays. An extended or deep recession may result in plant closures or other contractions in our customer base. These factors may also adversely affect our ability to collect payment for work we have previously performed. Furthermore, our ability to expand our business could be limited if, in the future, we are unable to increase our credit capacity under favorable terms or at all. Such disruptions, should they occur, could materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOur revenues are heavily dependent on certain industries. Sales of our services are dependent on customers in certain industries, particularly the refining and petrochemical industries. As we have experienced in the past, and as we expect to occur in the future, downturns characterized by diminished demand for services in these industries as well as potential changes due to consolidation or changes in customer businesses or governmental regulations, could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Certain of our customers have employees represented by unions and could be subject to temporary work stoppage which could impact our activity level.\nWe sell our services in highly competitive markets, which places pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our services. Our competition generally stems from other outside service contractors, many of whom offer a similar range of services. Future economic uncertainty could generally reduce demand for industrial services and thus create a more competitive bidding environment for new and existing work. No assurances can be made that we will continue to maintain our pricing model and our profit margins or increase our market share.\nOur ongoing investments in new customer markets involve significant risks and could disrupt our current operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect. Our ability to compete successfully in new customer markets depends on our ability to continue to deliver innovative, relevant and useful services to our customers in a timely manner. As a result, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest resources in developing products and services to new customers. Such investments may not prioritize short-term financial results and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including encountering new competitors. We may fail to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin or other value to justify our investments in such new customer markets, thereby harming our ability to generate revenue.\nPublic health threats such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus may have a negative effect on our customers and supply chain. On December 31, 2019, a human infection originating in China was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus or COVID-19. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d and then on March 11, 2020, declared the outbreak to be a \u201cpandemic.\u201d Since its detection, the virus has spread to various countries, including the United States. The United States and other countries have placed restrictions on travel to and from China and other affected regions, and a number of businesses in affected regions have temporarily closed. While we have no direct operations in China, the geographic scope of the outbreak remains uncertain and changes daily. Potential effects of the outbreak include volatility in the financial markets, the effect of travel restrictions on the global economy, supply chain disruptions and the impact on certain commodity prices. Some of these factors may affect us directly, in the form of travel restrictions, disruptions to our supply chain for consumables or equipment sourced from affected areas, and more importantly, the impact to our customer base, especially in the petrochemical and refining industries. The novel coronavirus\u2019s impact on the global economy may lead to a decrease in worldwide demand for oil and refined products which may lead to diminished demand for our services.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nIf we are not able to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures and technology trends, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more cost-effective services. If we are not able to implement commercially competitive services and products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures and technology trends, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nNo assurances can be made that we will be successful in maintaining or renewing our contracts with our customers. A significant portion of our contracts and agreements with customers may be terminated by either party on short notice. Although we actively pursue the renewal of our contracts, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these contracts or that the terms of the renewed contracts will be as favorable as the existing contracts. If we are unable to renew or replace these contracts, or if we renew on less favorable terms, we may suffer a material reduction in revenue and earnings.\nNo assurances can be made that we will be successful in hiring or retaining members of a skilled technical workforce. We have a skilled technical workforce and an industry recognized technician training program for each of our service lines that prepares new employees as well as further trains our existing employees. The competition for these individuals is intense. The loss of the services of a number of these individuals, or failure to attract new employees, could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on our customers\u2019 projects or maintenance and consequently could negatively impact the demand for our products and services.\nThe loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage and exercise leadership over our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nUnsatisfactory quality of service execution, including safety performance, can affect customer relationships, eliminate or reduce revenue streams from our largest customers, result in higher operating costs and negatively impact our ability to hire and retain a skilled technical workforce. The services we provide could incur quality of execution issues that may be caused by our workforce personnel and/or components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our services does not meet our customers\u2019 expectations or satisfaction, then our sales and operating earnings, and, ultimately, our reputation, could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing services at industrial facilities. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, destruction of property, plant and equipment, lower employee morale and environmental damage. While we are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and minimizing the risk of accidents, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be effective. Poor safety performance may limit or eliminate potential revenue streams, including from many of our largest customers, and may materially increase our operating costs, including increasing our required insurance deductibles, self-insured retention and insurance premium costs.\nAdditional impairments of our goodwill, impairments of our intangible and other long-lived assets, and changes in the estimated useful lives of intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. As a result of past acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a substantial portion of our total assets. As of December 31, 2019, our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $282.0 million and $117.0 million, respectively. We assess or test goodwill for impairment at least annually in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d), while our other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A decrease in our market capitalization or profitability or unfavorable changes in market, economic and industry conditions all would increase the risk of impairment. In 2017, we determined that there were sufficient indicators to trigger interim goodwill impairment tests. The indicators included, among other factors, market softness and the related impacts on our financial results and our stock price. This resulted in an impairment loss of $75.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. Our 2018 and 2019 annual goodwill impairment tests, which were completed as of December 1, 2018 and December 1, 2019, respectively, did not result in any additional impairment. However, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the Company\u2019s most recent goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Accordingly, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future reporting periods, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nGAAP requires that we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets subject to amortization each reporting period. If the estimate of an intangible asset\u2019s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. To the extent the revised useful life of an intangible asset is less than originally estimated, our future amortization expense will increase, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nImprovements in operating results from expected savings in operating costs from workforce reductions and other cost saving and business improvement initiatives may not be realized in the estimated amounts, may take longer to be realized, or could be realized only for a limited period. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we engaged outside consultants to assess all aspects of our business for improvement and cost saving opportunities as part of a new cost savings and business improvement project. In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the design phase of the project, known as OneTEAM, and are now in the deployment phase. In the third quarter of 2019, we began the design phase of OneTEAM for our international operations. We expect to incur various additional expenses associated with the execution of the OneTEAM project through 2020 with funding provided by our operating cash flows and the Credit Facility. However, in order to implement this or any other future cost savings or business improvement initiatives, we expect to incur additional expenses, which could adversely impact our financial results prior to the realization of the expected benefits associated with the initiatives. Due to numerous factors or future developments, we may not achieve cost reductions or other business improvements consistent with our expectations or the benefits may be delayed. These factors or future developments could include (i) the incurrence of higher than expected costs or delays in reassigning and retraining remaining employees or outsourcing or eliminating duties and functions of eliminated employees, (ii) unanticipated delays in discharging employees in eliminated positions as a result of regulatory or legal limitations on employee terminations in certain jurisdictions, (iii) actual savings differing from anticipated cost savings, (iv) anticipated benefits from business improvement initiatives not materializing and (v) disruptions to normal operations or other unintended adverse impacts resulting from the initiatives.\nWe may also decide to reduce, suspend or terminate our cost saving and business improvement initiatives at any time before achieving the estimated benefits or after a limited period of time. The elimination of current employees can also result in increased future costs in hiring, training and mobilizing new employees or rehires in the event of a future increase in demand for our services resulting in a slower recovery of results from operations. Our initiatives may negatively affect our ability to retain and attract qualified personnel, who may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business. A portion of our operations are conducted and located outside the U.S., and accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, instability in political or economic conditions, difficulty in repatriating cash proceeds, differing employee relations, differing regulatory environments, trade protection measures, and difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. and foreign anti-corruption regulations applicable to us such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Our international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent. Although we have, and continue to, implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors or agents, including those representing us in countries where practices which violate such anti-corruption laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures. Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nBusiness acquisitions entail risk for investors. From time to time, we pursue acquisitions in, or complementary to, the specialty maintenance and specialty industrial services, including inspection, engineering assessment and mechanical services to complement and diversify our existing business. We may also acquire other businesses that enhance our services or geographic scope. We may not be able to expand our market presence through acquisitions, and acquisitions may present unforeseen integration difficulties or costs. No assurances can be made that we will realize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we may anticipate from any acquisition, or that we will realize such benefits within the time frame that we expect. If we are not able to address the challenges associated with acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses, or if our integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance, our business could be adversely affected. The consideration paid in connection with an acquisition may also affect our share price or future financial results depending on the structure of such consideration. To the extent we issue stock or other rights to purchase stock, including options or other rights, existing shareholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional debt.\nThe price of our outstanding securities may be volatile. It is possible that in some future quarter (or quarters) our revenues, operating results or other measures of financial performance will not meet the expectations of public stock market analysts or investors, which could cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline or be volatile. Historically, our quarterly and annual\nsales and operating results have fluctuated. We expect fluctuations to continue in the future. In addition to general economic and political conditions, and in addition to the other factors identified under this Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, the following factors may affect our sales and operating results: the timing of significant customer orders, the timing of planned maintenance projects at customer facilities, changes in competitive pricing, wide variations in profitability by product line, variations in operating expenses, rapid increases in raw material and labor costs, the timing of announcements or introductions of new products or services by us, our competitors or our respective customers, the acceptance of those services, our ability to adequately meet staffing requirements with qualified personnel, relative variations in manufacturing efficiencies and costs, and the relative strength or weakness of international markets. Since our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results vary, we believe that period-to-period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages, staffing shortages and other labor matters. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 6,800 employees, approximately 1,700 of whom were located in Canada and Europe where employees predominantly are represented by unions. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good and we have had no strikes or work stoppages, no assurances can be made that we will not experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees, or our employees in general, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor.\nWe extend credit to customers for purchases of our services which subjects us to potential credit risk that could, if realized, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us, or retain amounts paid to us, our cash flows would be reduced and we could experience losses. We would also recognize losses with respect to any receivables that are impaired as a result of our customers\u2019 financial difficulties or bankruptcies. The risk of loss may increase for capital projects where we provide services over a longer period of time. Credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of our geographically diverse and decentralized operations within the United States and other countries around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. We have offices and operations in approximately 200 locations in 20 countries throughout the world. This creates greater financial and operational risks due to the nature of our operations being conducted at various locations. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nWe are subject to risks associated with indebtedness under our banking credit facility, including the risk of failure to maintain compliance with financial covenants, the risk of being unable to make interest and principal payments when due and the risk of rising interest rates. The Credit Facility consists of a $225 million revolving loan facility and a $50 million term loan facility, and allows for an increase in total commitments of up to an additional $100 million if certain conditions are met. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2019, we were required to maintain (i) a maximum ratio of senior secured debt to consolidated EBITDA (the \u201cSenior Secured Leverage Ratio,\u201d as defined in the Credit Facility agreement) and (ii) a minimum ratio of the sum of consolidated EBITDA less taxes and capital expenditures paid in cash to consolidated debt service (the \u201cDebt Service Coverage Ratio,\u201d as defined in the Credit Facility agreement). Beginning March 31, 2020, we will also be required to maintain a maximum ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (the \u201cNet Leverage Ratio\u201d, as defined in the Credit Facility agreement).\nWe entered into the eighth amendment to the Credit Facility (the \u201cEighth Amendment\u201d) on August 30, 2019 to amend and restate certain portions of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 7, 2015, including modifying certain financial covenants. The Eighth Amendment amended the financial covenants in the Credit Facility by eliminating the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges (the \u201cInterest Coverage Ratio,\u201d as defined in the Credit Facility agreement), adding the Net Leverage Ratio and the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, and modifying the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio. The financial covenant requirements under the Eighth Amendment are summarized in the table below.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we are in compliance with these covenants. The Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and the Debt Service Coverage Ratio stood at 1.89 to 1.00 and 2.17 to 1.00, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. We are not bound by a covenant with respect to the Net Leverage Ratio until March 31, 2020; however, as of December 31, 2019 this ratio stood at 4.97 to 1.00.\nOur ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants is dependent upon our future operating performance and future financial condition, both of which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of any future date. In the event we are unable maintain compliance with our financial covenants, we would seek to enter into an amendment to the Credit Facility with our bank group in order to modify and/or to provide relief from the financial covenants for an additional period of time. Although we have entered into amendments in the past, there can be no assurance that any future amendments would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe rely primarily on cash flows from our operations to make required interest and principal payments on our debt under the Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, we may be unable to pay interest and principal obligations on our debt when they become due. Failure to comply with these obligations or failure to comply with the financial covenants discussed above could result in an event of default, which would permit our lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt. If our lenders accelerate the repayment of debt, there is no assurance that we could refinance such debt on terms favorable to us or at all.\nAll of the debt outstanding under the Credit Facility bears interest at variable market rates. If market interest rates increase, our interest expense and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Based on Credit Facility borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019, an increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would increase our interest expense and decrease our operating cash flows by approximately $1.2 million on an annual basis.\nOur Credit Facility restricts our ability to, among other items, incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions and alter the business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to operate our businesses and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nNo assurances can be made that we will be able to renew our Credit Facility, refinance the outstanding balance or otherwise repay our obligations in full prior to maturity on July 7, 2021. The Credit Facility matures on July 7, 2021 and under the terms of the Credit Facility, any outstanding balance is due in full on that date. As of December 31, 2019, under the Credit Facility, we had an outstanding principal balance of $123.6 million and outstanding letters of credit totaling $20.5 million. The ability to renew the Credit Facility, refinance the debt or otherwise repay the outstanding debt prior to maturity is dependent upon capital/credit market conditions as well as our financial condition, operating results and cash flows, all of which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions in addition to financial, business, legislative, governmental, political, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we can give no assurance that we will be able to renew the Credit Facility or refinance the debt on terms favorable to us, or at all, or that we will otherwise be able repay the Credit Facility obligations in full\nby the maturity date. In such event, we could face substantial liquidity problems, which could cause a materially adverse impact on our business operations.\nThe accounting method for our convertible debt securities may have a material effect on our reported financial results. On July 31, 2017 we issued $230.0 million principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) in a private offering. Accordingly, the issuance of the Notes and the subsequent accounting associated with the Notes has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the third quarter of 2017.\nUnder Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is included in the additional paid-in capital section of equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are recording a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income (or greater net loss) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method if we have the ability and intent to settle in cash, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount and if the effect would be dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that we will be able to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle the Notes in cash in any future reporting period or that future accounting standards will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then we would utilize the if-converted method, which would require us to assume the Notes would be settled entirely in shares of common stock for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, if the effect would be dilutive. In such case, our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nTransactions relating to our convertible debt securities may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The Notes are initially convertible into 10,599,067 shares of common stock, but the occurrence of certain corporate events could increase the conversion rate, which could result in the Notes becoming convertible into a maximum of 14,838,703 shares of common stock. Upon conversion, the Company may settle the Notes in cash or in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, in each case, at the Company\u2019s election. If the Notes are converted, our current intent is to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash and settle the remainder of our conversion obligation by issuing shares of common stock; however, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient funds available to us at the time of any such conversions in order to effect settlement in that manner. In such case, we could elect to settle the conversion obligation in a different combination of cash and shares of common stock or entirely in shares of common stock, depending on the circumstances. To the extent we deliver shares of common stock upon conversion of the Notes, the ownership interests of existing stockholders would be diluted. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Information Systems\nThe Company\u2019s operations and information systems, including its employee, customer and financial records, are subject to cybersecurity risks. Team continues to increase its dependence on digital technologies to conduct its operations. Many of the Company\u2019s files, including employee, customer and financial records, are digitized and more employees are working in almost paperless and remote environments. We have also outsourced certain information technology development, maintenance and support functions. As a result, the Company may be exposed to potentially severe cyber incidents at both its internal locations and outside vendor locations that could result in a theft of sensitive data and/or intellectual property, alteration or deletion of critical data and/or disruption of its operations for an extended period of time. This could also result in claims, losses, fines and higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents, although no such material incidents have occurred to date to the Company\u2019s knowledge.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of our information systems could disrupt operations and cause increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our\nbusiness. Although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards, our information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, telecommunication failures and other problems. If critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate and our tax obligations could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision, tax assets and accruals for other taxes, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit levels, changes in our business, reorganization of our business and operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the elections we make, changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as other factors.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.\nOur operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the environment, and worker health and safety, among other things. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and can impose substantial sanctions for violations or require operational changes that may limit our services. We must conform our operations to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and adapt to changes in such requirements in all locations in which we operate. These requirements can be expected to increase the overall costs of providing our services over time. Some of our services involve handling or monitoring highly regulated materials, including VOCs or hazardous wastes. Environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for the characterization, handling and disposal of regulated materials and require us to obtain permits and comply with various other requirements. The improper characterization, handling, or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure by us to comply with increasingly complex and strictly-enforced federal, state, local, and international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or associated permits could subject us to the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to operate our business and complete contracted services. A defect in our services or faulty workmanship could result in an environmental liability if, as a result of the defect or faulty workmanship, a contaminant is released into the environment. In addition, the modification or interpretation of existing environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations may also negatively impact industries in which our customers operate, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in reduced demand for our services and products. There has been an increased focus in the last several years on climate change in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the U.S. and other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of greenhouse gases. The adoption of new or more stringent legislation or regulatory programs limiting greenhouse gas emissions from customers for whom we provide repair and maintenance services could affect demand for our products and services. Further, some scientists have concluded that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere may produce physical effects, such as increased severity and frequency of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events. Such climate events have the potential to adversely affect our operations or those of our customers, which in turn could have a negative effect on us.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) departure from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) could adversely affect us. The U.K. held a referendum in 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d). In March 2017, the U.K. government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU. The U.K. Parliament passed a withdrawal bill on January 23, 2020, which was ratified by European Parliament shortly thereafter, marking the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU effective January 31, 2020. The U.K. will now enter into a transition period that is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020, unless it is requested to be extended before July 1, 2020. Negotiations are ongoing to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU, including, among other things, the terms of trade between the U.K. and the EU. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. reaches to retain access to EU markets. The outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and uncertainty about the terms and impact of Brexit may continue to do so in the future. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro,\nwhich in turn could adversely affect our customers, particularly in the U.K. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. negotiates with the EU. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including additional regulatory licensing to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business and we could also be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU. Any of these effects of Brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.\nRisks Related to Legal Liability\nThe Company\u2019s insurance coverage will not fully indemnify us against certain claims or losses. Further, the Company\u2019s insurance has limits and exclusions and not all losses or claims are insured. We perform services in hazardous environments on or around high-pressure, high temperature systems and our employees are exposed to a number of hazards, including exposure to hazardous materials, explosion hazards and fire hazards. Incidents that occur at these large industrial facilities or systems, regardless of fault, may be catastrophic and adversely impact our employees and third parties by causing serious personal injury, loss of life, damage to property or the environment, and interruption of operations. Our contracts typically require us to indemnify our customers for injury, damage or loss arising out of our presence at our customers\u2019 location, regardless of fault, or the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured under our insurance policies. We maintain limited insurance coverage against these and other risks associated with our business. Due to the high cost of general liability coverage, we maintain insurance with a self-insured retention of $1.0 million and a deductible of $2.0 million per occurrence. This insurance may not protect us against liability for certain events, including events involving pollution, product or professional liability, losses resulting from business interruption or acts of terrorism or damages from breach of contract by the Company. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur. Moreover, in the future, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any future damages caused by our products or services that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe are involved and are likely to continue to be involved in legal proceedings, which will increase our costs and, if adversely determined, could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are currently a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the operation of our business and it is reasonable to expect that we will be named in future actions. Most of the legal proceedings against us arise out of the normal course of performing services at customer facilities, and include claims for workers\u2019 compensation, personal injury and property damage. Legal proceedings can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a liability claim could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOther Risk Factors\nOther risk factors may include interruption of our operations, or the operations of our customers due to fire, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, labor disruptions, health epidemics and other events beyond our control.\nAny of these factors, individually or in combination, could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and/or stock price and could also affect whether any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ultimately prove to be accurate.", "PERMNO": 65752, "SIC": 8734, "TIC": "TISI"}
