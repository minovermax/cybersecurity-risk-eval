{"cik": "736012", "company": "INTRUSION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe had a net loss of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and we have an accumulated deficit of $61.3 million as of December 31, 2020. To improve our financial performance, we must increase revenue levels.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $6.5 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $61.3 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to a net income of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and an accumulated deficit of approximately $54.8 million at December 31, 2019. We need to increase current revenue levels from the sales of our solutions if we are to regain profitability. If we are unable to increase revenue levels, losses could continue for the near term and possibly longer, and we may not regain profitability or generate positive cash flow from operations in the future.\nWe may be unable to successfully market, promote, and sell our new commercial solution, INTRUSION Shield, and market it through new sales channels to a new set of prospective customers.\nWe anticipate significant resources will be required in order to succeed in launching our new Shield solution, including the time, attention, and focus of our senior management and our research and development team, coordination of new marketing strategies highlighting this new offering and promoting it through new and expanded sales channels to a wider audience of prospective customers than we have historically marketed and sold our solutions and services. In addition, significant financial resources will be required to successfully manage the implementation of this new solution. This could result in diversion of those resources from critical areas of our company operations and a potential strain on our liquidity and ability to meet our current and these anticipated increases in our cash-flow needs.\nWe could experience damage to our reputation in the cybersecurity industry in the event that our Shield solution fails to meet our customers\u2019 needs or to achieve market acceptance.\nOur reputation in the industry as a provider of entity identification, data mining, and advanced persistent threat detection solutions may be harmed, perhaps significantly, in the event that Shield fails to perform as we expect it to. If Shield does not perform as we expect, if we experience delivery delays, or if our customers do not perceive the benefits of purchasing and using Shield as part of their comprehensive cybersecurity solution, our position as a leader in this technology space may be damaged and could affect the willingness of our customers, as well as potential customers, to purchase our other solutions that function separately from Shield. Any reputational damage could result in a decrease in orders for all of our solutions, the loss of current customers, and a decrease in our overall revenues which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nThe effect of the coronavirus, particularly in the diversion of time and resources of the federal, state, and local governmental entities which make up a significant concentration of our customer base, have and may continue to cause material adverse effects on our operations and our financial results.\nA significant concentration of our federal, state, and local governmental customers have been forced to allocate scarce and competing resources and balance budgetary demands placed upon them as a result of the effects of the coronavirus, mandatory quarantines, decreased travel, interruptions in workforce populations, scarcity of commodities, and similar economic and operational effects of the virus upon their own constituencies. Considerable uncertainties continue with respect to the spread and containment of the pandemic, including, without limitation, the effects of mutations in the virus and the efficacy of vaccination efforts throughout the country and the world. These adverse effects have resulted in decreased demand by some of our customers for our current product offerings and cybersecurity solutions, negatively affecting historic revenue levels for the Company. In turn, we are continuing to adapt our operations and the efficiency of our own staff, employees, and strategic partners, including increased reliance on remote workplace solutions during 2020 and continuing indefinitely into 2021. A continued decrease in orders for our solutions by our government customers and losses of efficiency or diversions of resources in our own operations may continue to cause material adverse effect on our operations and financial results, which may not be offset even with the successful introduction of Shield solution into the marketplace.\nWe must expend time and resources addressing potential cybersecurity risk, and any breach of our information security safeguards could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe threat of cyber-attacks requires additional time and money to be expended in efforts to prevent any breaches of our information security protocols. However, we can provide no assurances that we can prevent all such attempts from being successful, which could result in expenses to address and remediate such breaches as well as potentially losing the confidence of our customers who depend upon our services to prevent and mitigate such attacks on their respective business. Should a material breach of our information security systems occur, it would likely have a material adverse impact on our business operations, our customer relations, and our current and future sales prospects, resulting in a significant loss of revenue.\nFluctuations in our quarterly revenues may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect our operating results to vary from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Therefore, if revenues are below our expectations, this shortfall is likely to adversely and disproportionately affect our operating results. Accordingly, we may not attain positive operating margins in future quarters. Any of these factors could cause our operating results to be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which likely would negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nA large percentage of our current revenues are received from U.S. government entities, and the loss of these customers or our failure to widen the scope of our customer base to include general commercial enterprises could negatively affect our revenues.\nA large percentage of our current revenues result from sales to U.S. government entities. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, our revenues could decline and our business and prospects may be materially harmed. Further, sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers, including potential disruption due to appropriation and spending patterns, delays in approving a federal budget and the government\u2019s right to cancel contracts and purchase orders for its convenience. While we expect that developing relationships with non-governmental customers will mitigate or eliminate this dependence on, and risk from, serving governmental entities, we can offer no assurances that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our customer portfolio in a time and manner to adequately mitigate this risk.\nAlmost all of our existing revenues are currently from one family of solutions with a limited number of customers, and the decrease of revenue from sales of this family of solutions could materially harm our business and prospects. Timeliness of orders from customers may cause volatility in growth.\nAlmost all of our existing revenues result from sales of one cybersecurity solution. TraceCop revenues were $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. While we anticipate the introduction of our new Shield solution will reduce our dependence on this single solution, we can offer no assurances as such, and in the absence of a shift in solution mix, we may continue to face risks in the event that sales of this key solution to these limited customers were to decrease.\nWe are highly dependent on sales of our current solutions through indirect channels, the loss of which would materially adversely affect our operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we derived 70.3% and 49.3% of our revenues from sales through indirect sales channels, such as distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturers and managed service providers. We must expand sales of our current solutions as well as any new solutions, such as Shield, through these indirect channels in order to increase our revenues. We cannot assure you that our current solutions or future solutions will gain market acceptance in these indirect sales channels or that sales through these indirect sales channels will increase our revenues. Further, many of our competitors are also trying to sell their products and solutions through these indirect sales channels, which could result in lower prices and reduced profit margins for sales of our solutions.\nYou will experience substantial dilution upon the exercise of certain stock options currently outstanding.\nOn February 12, 2021, we had 17,538,779 shares of common stock outstanding. Upon the exercising of current options exercisable at or below the exercise price of $4.75, we would have approximately 18,014,116 shares of common stock outstanding, a 2.71% increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding.\nWe resemble a developmental stage company and our business strategy may not be successful.\nWe depend exclusively on revenues generated from the sale of our current network security/advanced persistent threat detection solution (Savant), which has received limited market acceptance, and our entity identification, data mining and analytic solution (TraceCop). We can provide no assurances that these solutions or our newly developed Shield solution will ever achieve widespread market acceptance or that an adequate market for these solutions will ever emerge. Consequently, we resemble a developmental stage company and will face the following inherent risks and uncertainties:\n\u00b7 the need for our current and in-development solutions to achieve market acceptance and produce a sustainable revenue stream;\n\u00b7 our ability to manage costs and expenses;\n\u00b7 our dependence on key personnel;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms; and\n\u00b7 our ability to offer greater value than our competitors.\nOur business strategy may not successfully address these risks. If we fail to recognize significant revenues from the sales of our current and in-development solutions, our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to respond to rapid technological changes in the network security industry, we may lose customers or our solutions may become obsolete.\nThe network security industry is characterized by frequent product and service introductions, rapidly changing technology and continued evolution of new industry standards. We have and must continue to introduce upgrades to our current solutions rapidly in response to customer needs such as new computer viruses or other novel external attacks on computer networks. Further, our new Shield solution represents our efforts to continue to provide state-of-the art first-in-time innovation for our customer\u2019s cybersecurity solutions. As a result, our success depends upon our ability to develop and introduce timely upgrades, enhancements, and new solutions to meet evolving customer requirements and industry standards. The development of technologically advanced network security products and solutions is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, rapid response, and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced solutions successfully in a timely manner. Further, we or our competitors may introduce new solutions or enhancements that shorten the life cycle of our existing solutions or cause our existing solutions to become obsolete.\nWe face intense competition from both start-up and established companies that may have significant advantages over us and our solutions.\nThe market for our solutions is intensely competitive. There are numerous companies competing with us in various segments of the data security markets, and their products or solutions may have advantages over our solutions in areas such as conformity to existing and emerging industry standards, interoperability with networking and other cybersecurity products, management and security capabilities, performance, price, ease of use, scalability, reliability, flexibility, features, and technical support.\nOur principal competitors in the data mining and advanced persistent threat market include Niksun, NetScout, FireEye, and Darktrace. Our current and potential competitors may have one or more of the following significant advantages over us:\n\u00b7 greater financial, technical and marketing resources;\n\u00b7 better name recognition;\n\u00b7 more comprehensive security solutions;\n\u00b7 better or more extensive cooperative relationships; and\n\u00b7 larger customer base.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors. Some of our competitors may have, in relation to us, one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 longer operating histories;\n\u00b7 longer-standing relationships with OEM and end-user customers; and\n\u00b7 greater customer service, public relations and other resources.\nAs a result, these competitors may be able to more quickly develop or adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or solutions. Additionally, it is likely that new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nOur management and larger stockholders currently exercise significant control over our Company and such influence may be in conflict to your interests.\nAs of February 12, 2021, our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 8.7% of our voting power. In addition, other related affiliate parties control approximately 47.5% of voting power. As a result, these stockholders have been able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Although we follow our policies regarding related party transactions, we cannot entirely eliminate the influence of these stockholders as long as they hold such a concentration of the voting power of our common stock.\nOur solutions are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our solutions and services.\nOur solutions are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks and, in the case of ours, provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information. Our solutions have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our solutions may only be discovered after a solution has been installed and used by end customers. Any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in our solutions after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition could be harmed.\nA breach of network security could harm public perception of our cybersecurity solutions, which could cause us to lose revenues.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our cybersecurity solutions, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our solutions, the market perception of the effectiveness of our solutions could be harmed. This could cause us to lose current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value-added resellers and distributors. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques.\nIf our solutions do not interoperate with our customers\u2019 networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.\nOur solutions are designed to interface with our customers\u2019 existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products or solutions from other vendors. Many of our customers\u2019 networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our solutions will be required to interoperate with many products and solutions within these networks as well as future products or solutions in order to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers\u2019 networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our solutions will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, if our solutions do not interoperate with those of our customers\u2019 networks, demand for our solutions could be adversely affected, orders for our solutions could be cancelled, or our solutions could be returned. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects.\nWe must adequately protect our intellectual property in order to prevent loss of valuable proprietary information.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology. However, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse- engineer aspects of our solutions or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. This is particularly true in foreign countries whose laws may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and may not provide us with an effective remedy against unauthorized use. If protection of our intellectual property proves to be inadequate or unenforceable, others may be able to use our proprietary developments without compensation to us, resulting in potential cost advantages to our competitors.\nWe may incur substantial expenses defending ourselves against claims of infringement.\nThere are numerous patents held by many companies relating to the design and manufacture of network security systems. Third parties may claim that our solutions infringe on their intellectual property rights. Any claim, with or without merit, could consume our management\u2019s time, result in costly litigation, cause delays in sales or implementations of our solutions or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty and licensing agreements, if required and available, may be on terms unacceptable to us or detrimental to our business. Moreover, a successful claim of product infringement against us or our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology on commercially reasonable terms could seriously harm our business.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile in the future due to factors outside of our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile in the future. Our common stock was traded on the OTCQB until October 9, 2020, when it began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the market price of our common stock fluctuated between $2.70 and $19.09. The market value of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7 variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in estimates of our financial performance by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of our competitors;\n\u00b7 thinly traded common stock;\n\u00b7 our ability to successfully produce, market, and sell our new Shield solution through new and broader sales channels to an expanded potential client market;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of new products or solutions, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 product or design flaws, product recalls or similar occurrences;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of common stock in the future; and\n\u00b7 fluctuations in stock market prices and volume, which are relatively typical for high technology companies.", "PERMNO": 77624, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "INTZ"}
