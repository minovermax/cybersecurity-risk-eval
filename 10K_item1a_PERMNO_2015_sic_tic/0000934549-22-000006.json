RISK FACTORS\nOur short and long-term success is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors that are difficult to predict or beyond our control. As a result, an investment in our common stock involves risks. Our stockholders should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report, as well as in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), in evaluating our business. If any of these risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock may decline significantly. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider to be immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain statements below constitute \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in this section. For additional information, refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d within this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operating Businesses, Platform and Industry\nOur acquisitions of and investment in operating businesses and intellectual property assets are costly and could negatively affect our results of operations, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, or cause us to incur significant expense, and we may not realize the expected benefits of our operating businesses because of difficulties related to integration.\nWe have in the past acquired, and may in the future pursue acquisitions of, operating businesses and technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments that complement our business. In October 2021, we announced our acquisition of Printronix, a leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial impact printers, also known as line matrix printers, and related consumables and services.\nThe success of any acquisition depends on, among other things, our ability to combine our business with the acquired business in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing relationships and allows us to achieve development and operational synergies.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technology platforms, or offerings of any business we acquire, and realizing the anticipated economic, operational and other benefits of the acquisition in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays;\n\u2022failure to execute on the intended strategy and synergies;\n\u2022failure of the acquired operating businesses to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flow;\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u2022our inability to maintain the key customers, business relationships, suppliers, and brand potential of acquired operating businesses;\n\u2022uncertainty of entry into businesses or geographies in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger positions;\n\u2022unanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions or greater than expected costs in integrating the acquired businesses;\n\u2022responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses, including those that were not disclosed to us or exceed our estimates, such as liabilities arising out of the failure to maintain effective privacy, data protection and cybersecurity controls, and liabilities arising out of the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws;\n\u2022difficulties in or costs associated with assigning or transferring to us the acquired operating business\u2019 intellectual property or its licenses to third-party intellectual property;\n\u2022inability to maintain our culture and values, ethical standards, controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022challenges in integrating the workforce of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;\n\u2022challenges in integrating and auditing the financial statements of acquired companies that have not historically prepared financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; and\n\u2022potential accounting charges to the extent goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as trademarks, customer relationships, or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value.\nIt is possible that the integration process of our acquired businesses could result in the loss of key employees; the disruption of our ongoing business or the ongoing business of the acquired operating businesses; or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with third parties and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts between us and the acquired businesses will also require our management\u2019s significant attention from other opportunities that could have been beneficial to our stockholders. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock after the completion of our acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In particular, our acquisitions may not be accretive to our stock value in the near or long term.\nIn addition, we may issue shares of our common stock or other equity securities in connection with future acquisitions of businesses and technologies. Any such issuances of shares of our common stock could result in material dilution to our existing stockholders.\nWe expect to incur additional costs integrating the operations of any operating business and utilizing any intellectual property assets we acquire, as we incur higher development and regulatory costs, as the case may be, and must hire relevant personnel. If the total costs of the integration or utilization of our businesses or assets exceed the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nAccordingly, we may not succeed in addressing the risks associated with our acquisition of Printronix or any other acquisitions we undertake in the future. The inability to integrate successfully, or in a timely fashion, the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any acquired business or utilization of any assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur platform\u2019s success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain employees and management teams of our operating businesses, the loss of any of whom could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nOur platform\u2019s business model requires qualified and competent professionals and management teams to identify and develop advantaged opportunities and to direct day-to-day activities of our operating businesses, as the case may be. Accordingly, recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to our platform and our operating businesses\u2019 operations. Additionally, although our operating businesses have adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for goods and services may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient numbers of trained or qualified personnel, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur operating businesses also need qualified and competent personnel to execute their business plans and serve their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate both executives and other key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our financial performance. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff, sales, marketing and support positions are and will be critical to businesses, and competition for experienced employees in the industries of our operating businesses can be intense.\nTo help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we must offer a competitive compensation package, including cash, cash-based incentive awards and share-based incentive awards, such as restricted stock units. Because our cash-based and share-based incentive awards are dependent upon the performance conditions relating to our performance and the performance of the price our common stock, the future value of such awards are uncertain. If the anticipated value of such incentive awards does not materialize, or if the total compensation package ceases to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.\nOur success will further substantially depend on our ability to attract and retain key members of Acacia\u2019s management team and officers. If we lose one or more of these key employees, our results of operations, and in turn, the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we may enter into employment agreements with our officers, there can be no assurance that the entire term of any employment agreement will be served or that any employment agreement will be renewed upon expiration.\nThe success of our platform and the integration of our operating businesses is dependent on our relationship with Starboard.\nOur strategic relationship with Starboard provides us access to capital, industry expertise, and a deep bench of operating partners and industry experts to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities and enhance the oversight and value creation of such businesses once acquired. As part of our relationship, Starboard assists with sourcing and evaluating appropriate acquisition opportunities. If we were to discontinue our relationship with Starboard, we may not be able to continue to adequately source acquisition opportunities.\nAdditionally, the success of our platform depends on the continued availability of, and our access to, Starboard\u2019s industry expertise and deep bench of operating partners and industry experts. We do not have employment agreements with these individuals who are independent of Starboard and Starboard\u2019s key personnel. If these individuals do not maintain their\nexisting relationships with Starboard and its affiliates, we may not be able to identify appropriate replacements in order to continue to adequately source acquisition opportunities or manage our existing operating businesses.\nThe due diligence process we undertake in connection with new acquisitions of operating businesses or intellectual property assets may not reveal all material facts.\nBefore making acquisitions, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and applicable circumstances. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of business and transaction. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an acquisition, we rely on the resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the transaction and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. The due diligence investigation that we carry out with respect to any opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such opportunity. Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the acquisition being successful. If we do not discover all material facts during due diligence, we may fail to integrate our operating businesses and execute our strategic goals, which may impact our financial performance.\nOur acquisition strategy may include acquisitions of privately held companies, which provide more limited information, may be dependent on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel, and have greater vulnerability to economic downturns when compared to public company targets.\nFrom time to time, we acquire, and may acquire, privately held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on diligence efforts to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. These companies and their financial information are not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules that govern public companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed decision, and we may lose money on our acquisition.\nIf, in the future, we cease to control and operate our operating businesses, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.\nFrom time to time, we have made, and we may continue to make, investments in businesses that we will not operate or control. If we make significant investments in businesses we do not operate or control, or cease to operate and control our operating businesses, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). If we were deemed to be an investment company, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC, or modify our investments or organizational structure or our contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company.\nRegistering as an investment company could, among other things, materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, materially limit our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and otherwise will subject us to additional regulation that will be costly and time-consuming.\nBoth Acacia and our operating businesses outsource a number of services to third-party service providers, which are subject to disruptions, delays, and decrease in our control, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nBoth we and our operating businesses outsource a number of services, including certain hosted software applications for confidential data storage and \u201ccloud computing\u201d technology for such storage (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user\u2019s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an Internet-based service), to domestic and overseas third-party service providers. While outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations, they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered, on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions, or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations.\nIn addition, many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ \u201ccloud computing\u201d technology for such storage (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user\u2019s physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an Internet-based service). These providers\u2019 cloud computing systems may be\nsusceptible to \u201ccyber incidents,\u201d such as intentional cyber-attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises that are outside of our control. If we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies, if our third-party service providers do not perform as anticipated or do not adequately protect our data from cyber-related security breaches, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, we may experience operational difficulties (such as limitations on our ability to ship products), increased costs, service interruptions or delays, loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data, quality and compliance issues, and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the ability to use net operating losses and certain other tax attributes.\nOur ability to use our federal and state net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the net operating losses, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all or any portion of our net operating losses. In addition, utilization of net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is subject to annual limitations under the \u201cownership change\u201d provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and similar state provisions, which may result in the expiration of net operating losses before future utilization. In general, under the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating losses and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development credit carryforwards) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, could in the future result in an ownership change. Although we have adopted a provision in our certificate of incorporation designed to discourage investors from acquiring ownership of our common stock in a manner that could trigger an ownership change, and we have completed studies to provide reasonable assurance that an ownership change limitation would not apply, we cannot be certain that a taxing authority would reach the same conclusion. If, after a review or audit, an ownership change limitation were to apply, utilization of our domestic net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods and a portion of the carryforwards could expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities.\nData security and integrity are critically important to our businesses, and cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks, breaches of security, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information, business disruption, or the perception that confidential information is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, regulatory enforcement, substantial legal liability and/or significant harm to their reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImproper access to, misappropriation, destruction or disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data could result in significant harm to our reputation or the reputation of us or of any of our operating businesses.\nThe security and protection of our and their data is our top priority. Our business, including our operating businesses, have devoted significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade the wide array of physical, technical and contractual safeguards that they employ to provide security around the collection, storage, use, access and delivery of information we and they possess. We and they have implemented various measures to manage their risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but an actual or perceived security breach, a failure to make adequate disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of its information technology systems could damage our or one of our operating businesses\u2019 reputation and cause us to lose opportunities or them to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales and results of operations and require us or them to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues.\nAlthough neither we nor our businesses have incurred material losses or liabilities to date as a result of any breaches, unauthorized disclosure, loss or corruption of our or their data or inability of their clients to access their systems, such events could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee or business data, disrupt their operations, subject us or them to substantial regulatory and legal proceedings and potential liability and fines, result in a material loss of business and/or significantly harm our or their reputation. If we are unable to efficiently manage the vulnerability of our systems and effectively maintain and upgrade system safeguards, we and they may incur unexpected costs and certain of our or their systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nDue to concerns regarding data security and integrity, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted breach notification and other requirements in the event that information subject to such laws is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such data are possible. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of unauthorized access would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability. In many jurisdictions, including North America and the European Union, Printronix is subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this information including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). California also enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and the related California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) that afford California residents expanded privacy protections and a private right of action for security breaches affecting their personal information. These and other similar laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which Printronix provides services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Printronix\u2019s failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect our computer systems, software, networks, data and other technology assets it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our businesses.\nPublic health threats such as COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on our operations, the operations of our business partners, and the global economy as a whole.\nPublic health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world, could adversely impact our operations, as well as the operations of our licensees and other business partners. We have taken precautions in the operation of our own business and maintain an up-to-date disaster recovery and business continuity policy as well as have the systems and support to have our workforce work remotely for an indefinite period of time. However, any further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, or the occurrence of other similar outbreaks or epidemics, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property Business and Industry\nOur intellectual property business is reliant on the strength of our patent portfolios and is subject to evolving legislation, regulations, and rules associated with patent law.\nThe success of our intellectual property business is heavily dependent obtaining and enforcing patents. Patent acquisition and enforcement is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. Obtaining and enforcing patents across various industries, including the life science industry, involves a high degree of technological and legal complexity. Our patent rights may be affected by developments or uncertainty in U.S. or foreign patent statutes, patent case law, USPTO rules and regulations and the rules and regulations of foreign patent offices. In addition, the United States may, at any time, enact changes to U.S. patent law and regulations, including by legislation, by regulatory rulemaking, or by judicial precedent, that adversely affect the scope of patent protection available and weaken the rights of patent owners to obtain patents, enforce against patent infringement and obtain injunctions and/or damages. For example, over the past several years, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court issued various opinions, and the USPTO modified its guidance for practitioners on multiple occasions, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Other countries may likewise enact changes to their patent laws in ways that adversely diminish the scope of patent protection and weaken the rights of patent owners to obtain patents, enforce against patent infringement, and obtain injunctions and/or damages. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents, and whether Congress or other foreign legislative bodies may pass patent reform legislation that is unfavorable to us.\nFurther, the United States and other governments may, at any time, enact changes to law and regulation that create new avenues for challenging the validity of issued patents. For example, the America Invents Act created new administrative post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter-partes review, and derivation proceedings that allow third parties to challenge the validity of issued patents. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts\nnecessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nAfter March 2013, under the America Invents Act, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system in which, assuming other statutory requirements are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third-party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before we file an application covering the same invention, could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This change requires vigilance. Because patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensor\u2019s patents or patent applications. Even where we have a valid and enforceable patent, we may not be able to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention where the other party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our filing date or the other party benefits from a compulsory license. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFinally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions. In addition, recent federal court decisions have lowered the threshold for obtaining attorneys\u2019 fees in patent infringement cases and increased the level of deference given to a district court\u2019s fee-shifting determination. These decisions may make it easier for district courts to shift a prevailing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees to a non-prevailing party if the district court believes that the case was weak or conducted in an abusive manner. As a result, defendants in patent infringement actions brought by non-practicing entities may elect not to settle because these decisions make it much easier for defendants to get attorneys\u2019 fees.\nPatent litigation is inherently risky because courts may find our patents invalid, not infringed, or unenforceable, and the USPTO, or other relevant patent office, may either invalidate our patents or materially narrow the scope of their claims during the course of a reexamination, opposition or other such proceeding.\nPatent litigation is inherently risky and may result in the invalidation of our patents, even if we are the plaintiff in an underlying action. It is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at any level.\nAlthough we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries and trial courts. At the trial level, it is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies, and as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation.\nIn the United States, there is a higher rate of appeals in patent enforcement litigation than standard business litigation. The defendant to any case we bring may file as many appeals as allowed by right, including to District Court, the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court. Such appeals are expensive and time-consuming, and the outcomes of such appeals are sometimes unpredictable, resulting in increased costs and reduced or delayed revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These appeals may also result in the invalidation of our patents, which may have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance.\nThe enforcement of our intellectual property depends in part upon our ability to retain the best legal counsel in order to achieve favorable outcomes from litigation, and we may become conflicted out of such representation.\nThe success of our intellectual property business depends in part upon our ability to retain the best legal counsel to coordinate our patent infringement litigation matters. As our intellectual property business evolves, we expect it will become more difficult to find the best legal counsel to handle all of our patent matters due in part to potential conflicts of interest. This is because, from time to time, the counterparties to our litigation matters have previously engaged world class\nlaw firms that are specialized to the industries of the patents at issue in such matters. These previous engagements may have, or may in the future, result in these firms being conflicted out of representing us.\nIn addition, counterparties in our patent litigation matters may devote a substantial amount of resources to avoid or limit a finding that they are liable for infringing on our patents or, in the event liability is found, to avoid or limit the amount of associated damages. There is a risk these counterparties may file inter-partes reviews, reexaminations or other proceedings with the USPTO or other government agencies in the United States or abroad in an attempt to invalidate, narrow the scope or render unenforceable the patents we own or control. If this were to occur, it may have a significant negative impact on the operations of our intellectual property business.\nThe inability to retain the best legal counsel to represent our operating businesses in infringement actions may result in unfavorable or adverse outcomes, which may result in losses, exhaustion of financial resources or other adverse effects which could encumber our ability to effectively operate our business or execute our business strategy. We cannot ensure that any of our current or prospective patent prosecution or litigation matters will result in a favorable outcome for us.\nWe may experience delays in successful prosecution, enforcement, and licensing of our patent portfolio.\nThe value of our patent portfolios is dependent upon the issuance of patents in a timely manner. More patent applications are filed each year, resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO. We believe this increase in patent applications has resulted in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. If the USPTO experiences reductions in funding, it could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications, negatively impacting the value of our patent portfolio pipeline. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an increase in our expenses. Application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from these patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nAfter prosecuting our patents, our operating businesses incur significant general and administrative and legal expense prior to entering into license agreements and generating license revenues. We spend considerable resources educating prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement with us. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins.\nWe are frequently engaged in litigation to enforce the terms of our existing license agreements, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Enforcement actions divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations and there are no assurances that such enforcement actions will result in favorable results for us.\nPatent litigation schedules in general, and in particular trial dates, are subject to routine adjustment, and in most cases delay, as courts adjust their calendars or respond to requests from one or more parties. Trial dates often are rescheduled by the court for various reasons that are often unrelated to the underlying patent assets and typically for reasons that are beyond our control. As a result, to the extent such events are an indicator of possible future revenue opportunities for us, or other outcome determinative events, they may and often do change which can result in delay of the expected scheduled event. Any such delay could be significant and could affect the corresponding future revenue opportunities, thus adversely impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, federal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer. Our patent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases. Criminal cases tend to take priority over our actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before federal judges and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions will have a greater negative effect on our business in the future unless this trend changes.\nRisks Related to our Operating Businesses\nCertain of our operating businesses rely, or may rely in the future, on their intellectual property and licenses to use others\u2019 intellectual property for competitive advantage. If our operating businesses are unable to protect their intellectual property or obtain or retain licenses to use other\u2019s intellectual property, or if they infringe upon or are alleged to have infringed upon others\u2019 intellectual property, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nCertain of our operating businesses\u2019 success depend in part on their, or licenses to use others\u2019, brand names, proprietary technology and manufacturing techniques. These businesses rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect their intellectual property rights. The steps they have taken to protect their intellectual property rights may not prevent third parties from using their intellectual property and other proprietary information without their authorization or independently developing intellectual property and other proprietary information that is similar. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our businesses\u2019 intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nStopping unauthorized use of our operating businesses\u2019 proprietary information and intellectual property and defending claims that they have made unauthorized use of others\u2019 proprietary information or intellectual property, may be difficult, time consuming, and costly. The use of their intellectual property and other proprietary information by others, and the use by others of their intellectual property and proprietary information, could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage they have developed, cause them to lose sales or otherwise harm their business.\nOur operating businesses may become involved in legal proceedings and claims in the future either to protect their intellectual property or to defend allegations that they have infringed upon others\u2019 intellectual property rights. These claims and any resulting litigation could subject them to significant liability for damages and invalidate their property rights. In addition, these lawsuits, regardless of their merits, could be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management\u2019s time and attention. The costs associated with any of these actions could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, business, and results of operations.\nCertain of our operating businesses\u2019 inability to develop new products and enhance existing products to meet customer product requirements on a cost competitive basis may negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe future results of operations of our operating businesses, including Printronix, may be adversely affected if they are unable to continue to develop, manufacture and market products that are reliable, competitive, and meet customers\u2019 needs. The markets for matrix printers, associated supplies and software are aggressively competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality. In addition, the introduction of any significant new and/or disruptive technology or business model by a competitor that substantially changes the markets into which our operating businesses sell their products or demand for the products they sell could severely impact sales of their products and our results of operations. The impact of competitive activities on the sales volumes or our revenue, or our inability to effectively deal with these competitive issues, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain or grow market share. The competitive pressure to develop technology and products and to increase our investment in research and development and marketing expenditures also could cause significant changes in the level of our operating expense.\nCertain of our operating businesses are dependent on a limited number of customers to derive a large portion of their revenue, and the loss of one of these customers may adversely affect the financial condition, business and results of operations of these businesses.\nPrintronix derives a significant amount of revenue from a concentrated number of retailers, distributors, and manufacturers. Any negative change involving these retailers, distributors, and manufacturers, including industry consolidation, store closings, reduction in purchasing levels or bankruptcies, could negatively impact the sales of these businesses and may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of these businesses.\nCertain of our operating businesses have limited suppliers for key product components and services they rely on and any interruption in supply could impair their ability to make and deliver their signature products, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOutsource providers and component suppliers have played, and will continue to play, a key role in Printronix\u2019s manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of its transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions, or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect.\nAlthough our operating businesses may attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. There is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our results of operations and damage our customer relationships.\nFailure of our operating businesses to manage inventory levels or production capacity may negatively impact our results of operations.\nPrintronix\u2019s financial performance depends in part upon their ability to successfully forecast the timing and extent of customer demand and reseller demand to manage worldwide distribution and inventory levels. Unexpected fluctuations in customer demand or in reseller inventory levels could disrupt ordering patterns and may adversely affect our financial results, inventory levels and cash flows. In addition, the financial failure or loss of a key customer, reseller or supplier could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We must also address production and supply constraints, including product disruptions caused by quality issues, and delays or disruptions in the supply of key components necessary for production. Such delays, disruptions or shortages may result in lost revenue or in additional costs to meet customer demand. Our future results of operations and ability to effectively grow or maintain market share may be adversely affected if we are unable to address these issues on a timely basis.\nCertain of our operating businesses\u2019 inability to perform satisfactorily under service contracts for managed print services may negatively impact our financial performance and results of operations.\nPrintronix continuously seeks to develop new services and products that complement or leverage the underlying design or process technology of its traditional product and service offerings. Printronix makes significant investments in service and product technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new software-led services and product development over the next several years. There can be no assurance that Printronix\u2019s service and product development efforts will be successful, it will be able to cost effectively develop or manufacture these new services and products, or will be able to successfully market these services and products or that margins generated from sales of these services and products will recover costs of development efforts.\nFurther, Printronix\u2019s inability to perform satisfactorily under service contracts for managed print services and other customer services may result in the loss of customers, loss of reputation and/or financial consequences that may have a material adverse impact our financial results and strategy.\nDecreased consumption of supplies could negatively impact the results of operations of certain of our operating businesses.\nPrintronix expects approximately 48.8% of its revenue for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 will be derived from the sale of supplies. Our future results of operations may be adversely affected if the consumption of Printronix\u2019s supplies by end users of its products is lower than expected or declines, if there are declines in pricing, unfavorable mix and/or increased costs. Further, changes of printing behavior driven by adoption of electronic processes and/or use of mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones by businesses could result in a reduction in printing, which could adversely impact consumption of supplies.\nDue to the international nature of certain of our operating businesses, changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions or other factors could negatively impact the results of operations of certain of our operating businesses.\nWe expect revenue derived from international sales will comprise approximately 58% of Printronix\u2019s revenue for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. Accordingly, Printronix\u2019s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; conflict and war; trade protection measures; local labor regulations; import, export or other licensing requirements; requirements related to making foreign direct investments; and unexpected changes in legal or regulatory requirements. As an example, in addition to indirectly raising transportation costs of the raw materials Printronix uses to manufacture its products, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in March 2022 required Printronix to adapt its operations and require its customers in the region to pre-pay expenses such that Printronix can avoid accruing accounts receivable. The duration and magnitude of the impacts of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on Printronix\u2019s business remain uncertain, and we will continue to monitor the situation and adapt our operations accordingly.\nIn addition, changes in tax laws and the ability to repatriate cash accumulated outside the United States in a tax efficient manner may adversely affect Printronix\u2019s financial results, investment flexibility and operations. Moreover, margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales, and we believe international operations in emerging geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the U.S. and European markets, in part, because of the higher investment levels for marketing, selling and distribution required to enter these markets.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, it is common for local business practices to be prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to Printronix, such as employment laws, fair trade laws or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although Printronix implements policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those business partners to which Printronix outsources certain business operations, may take actions in violation of these policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. Because of the challenges in managing a geographically dispersed workforce, there also may be additional opportunities for employees to commit fraud or personally engage in practices which violate our policies and procedures.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur quarterly performance may be volatile, which in turn may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nDue to the nature of our intellectual property business and reliance on our operating businesses on intellectual property, legal expenses associated with acquisitions, uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of our receipt of license and other fees from potential infringers, stemming primarily from uncertainties regarding the outcome of enforcement actions, rates of adoption of our patented technologies, the growth rates of our existing licensees, and certain other factors, our revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and period to period, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and results of operations, cause our quarterly and periodic results to fall below market expectations. As a result of these factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, may have limited utility as an indicator of future performance. Significant variation in our quarterly performance, compounded by the thin trading volume of our common stock, could significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for operations and patent portfolio investments, or pay for interests in additional subsidiary companies by using shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership interests in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nDelaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\n\u2022Provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and the removal of incumbent officers and directors, more difficult. These provisions include:\n\u2022Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a merger with a 15%-or-greater stockholder, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer, until three years after that party became a 15%-or-greater stockholder;\n\u2022the authorization in our certificate of incorporation of undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover; and\n\u2022the general restriction in our certificate of incorporation on any direct or indirect transfers of our common stock if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct or indirect ownership of our common stock by any person or group from less than 4.899% to 4.899% or more of our common stock; or (ii) increase the percentage of our common stock owned directly or indirectly by a person or group owning or deemed to own 4.899% or more of our common stock.\nTogether, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that could otherwise involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nOn February 23, 2016, our board of directors eliminated our dividend policy that provided for the discretionary payment of a total annual cash dividend of $0.50 per share to holders of our common stock, payable in the amount of $0.125 per share per quarter, effective as of February 23, 2016. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nThe issuance of the Starboard Securities (defined below) to Starboard and its permitted transferees dilutes the ownership and relative voting power of holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement with Starboard, dated November 18, 2019, the Company sold to Starboard (i) 350,000 shares of its newly designated Series A Preferred Stock and Series A Warrants to purchase up to 5 million shares of common stock in 2019, and (ii) Series B Warrants to purchase up to 100 million shares of common stock in 2020. The investment by Starboard is referred to herein as the \u201cStarboard Investment,\u201d and the Series A Preferred Stock, Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants are referred to herein as, collectively, the \u201cStarboard Securities.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Series A Preferred Stock held by Starboard represents approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. Because holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock to Starboard effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, the conversion and/or exercise of the Starboard Securities into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock. Furthermore, any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of the Starboard Securities could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Pursuant to a customary Registration Rights Agreement with Starboard, we have registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 of 130% of the shares of common stock underlying Starboard Securities outstanding as of November 9, 2020. In addition, we have agreed to provide (i) certain demand registration rights with respect to the Starboard Securities and (ii) additional registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued upon the conversion or exercise of the Starboard Securities, to the extent not included in previous registration statements. These registrations may facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the\nnumber of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by Starboard of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, result in the interests of holders of our Series A Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders and delay or prevent an attempt to take over the Company.\nStarboard and the other holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid, before any payment may be made to holders of our common stock in connection with a liquidation event, an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i) the stated value thereof plus accrued and unpaid dividends, and (ii) the amount that would have been received had such share of Series A Preferred Stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation event.\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a preferential cumulative dividend at the rate of 3.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Upon the consummation of a suitable investment or acquisition by the Company, such investment to be identified and approved by each of the Company and Starboard, the dividend rate will increase to 8.0% per annum.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock also have certain redemption rights, including the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock during certain specified periods and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, and Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Certificate of Designations. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock also have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock upon certain change of control events.\nThese dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between Starboard and holders of our common stock. Furthermore, a sale of our Company, as a change of control event, may require us to repurchase Series A Preferred Stock, which could have the effect of making an acquisition of the Company more expensive and potentially deterring proposed transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nStarboard has certain rights, including the ability to designate up to three members of our board of directors.\nThe transaction documents entered into in connection with the Starboard Investment grant to Starboard consent rights with respect to certain actions by us, including:\n\u2022amending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the Series A Preferred Stock; and\n\u2022increasing the maximum number of directors on our board to more than seven persons, subject to the terms of the Governance Agreement entered into in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, or the Governance Agreement.\nThe Securities Purchase Agreement also imposes a number of affirmative and negative covenants on us.\nIn addition, the terms of the Governance Agreement grant Starboard certain rights to designate directors to be nominated for election by holders of our common stock. For so long as certain criteria set forth in the Governance Agreement are satisfied, including that Starboard beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least 4.0% of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding common stock (on an as-converted basis, if applicable), Starboard has the right to designate up to three directors for election to our Board.\nThe directors designated by Starboard also are entitled to serve on committees of our Board, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules.", "PERMNO": 89611, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "ACTG"}
