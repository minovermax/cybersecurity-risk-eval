RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under such circumstances, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Company\nWe have had a history of losses and no revenue, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nSince inception on January 23, 2004 through September 30, 2015, we have an accumulated deficit of $63,281,455. We can offer no assurance that we will ever operate profitably or that we will generate positive cash flow in the future. To date, we have not generated any revenues from our operations. Our history of losses and no revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our management expects the business to continue to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future and cannot predict when, if ever, our business might become profitable. We will need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. This may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are an early development stage pharmaceutical research and development company and may never be able to successfully develop marketable products or generate any revenue. We have a very limited relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. There is no assurance that our future operations will result in profits. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues, we may suspend or cease operations.\nWe are an early development stage company and have not generated any revenues to date and have no operating history. All of our potential drug compounds are in the concept stage or early clinical development stage. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our research and development efforts will be successful or, if successful, that our potential drug compounds will ever be approved for sales to pharmaceutical companies or generate commercial revenues. We have no relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. We are subject to all of the business risks associated with a new enterprise, including, but not limited to, risks of unforeseen capital requirements, failure of potential drug compounds either in non-clinical testing or in clinical trials, failure to establish business relationships and competitive disadvantages against larger and more established companies. If we fail to become profitable, we may suspend or cease operations.\nWe will need additional funding and may be unable to raise additional capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development activities.\nWe will need to raise additional funding and the current economic conditions may have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional needed capital on terms that are favorable to our Company or at all. We may not be able to generate significant revenues for several years, if at all. Until we can generate significant revenues, if ever, we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through equity or debt financing. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research and development activities.\nRisks Related to our Business\nEven if we are able to develop our potential drug compounds, we may not be able to receive regulatory approval, or if approved, we may not be able to generate significant revenues or successfully commercialize our products, which will adversely affect our financial results and financial condition and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development plans which may force us to cease operations.\nAll of our potential drug compounds will require extensive additional research and development, including non-clinical testing and clinical trials, as well as regulatory approvals, before we can market them. We cannot predict if or when any of the potential drug compounds we intend to develop will be approved for marketing. There are many reasons that we may fail in our efforts to develop our potential drug compounds. These include:\n\u00b7 the possibility that non-clinical testing or clinical trials may show that our potential drug compounds are ineffective and/or cause harmful side effects;\n\u00b7 our potential drug compounds may prove to be too expensive to manufacture or administer to patients;\n\u00b7 our potential drug compounds may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the United States Food and Drug Administration or foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7 even if our potential drug compounds are approved, we may not be able to produce them in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs;\n\u00b7 even if our potential drug compounds are approved, they may not achieve commercial acceptance;\n\u00b7 regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to any of our potential drug compounds, which could adversely affect their commercial success; and\n\u00b7 the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our potential collaborative partners from marketing our potential drug compounds.\nIf we fail to develop our potential drug compounds, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected, we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development plans and may be forced to cease operations.\nOur research and development plans will require substantial additional future funding which could impact our operational and financial condition. Without the required additional funds, we will likely cease operations.\nIt will take several years before we are able to develop potentially marketable products, if at all. Our research and development plans will require substantial additional capital, arising from costs to:\n\u00b7 conduct research, non-clinical testing and human studies;\n\u00b7 establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities; and\n\u00b7 establish and develop quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales, finance and administrative capabilities to support these programs.\nOur future operating and capital needs will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs;\n\u00b7 the scope and results of pre-clinical testing and human studies;\n\u00b7 the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, securing, maintaining and enforcing patents;\n\u00b7 competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish additional collaborations;\n\u00b7 changes in our existing collaborations;\n\u00b7 the cost of manufacturing scale-up; and\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our commercialization activities.\nWe base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables. Such uncertainties include the success of our research initiatives, regulatory approvals, the timing of events outside our direct control such as negotiations with potential strategic partners and other factors. Any of these uncertain events can significantly change our cash requirements as they determine such one-time events as the receipt or payment of major milestones and other payments.\nAdditional funds will be required to support our operations and if we are unable to obtain them on favorable terms, we may be required to cease or reduce further research and development of our drug product programs, sell some or all of our intellectual property, merge with another entity or cease operations.\nIf we fail to demonstrate efficacy in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials our future business prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our research and development efforts will be greatly dependent upon our ability to demonstrate potential drug compound efficacy in non-clinical studies, as well as in clinical trials. Non-clinical studies involve testing potential drug compounds in appropriate non-human disease models to demonstrate efficacy and safety. Regulatory agencies evaluate these data carefully before they will approve clinical testing in humans. If certain non-clinical data reveals potential safety issues or the results are inconsistent with an expectation of the potential drug compound\u2019s efficacy in humans, the regulatory agencies may require additional more rigorous testing before allowing human clinical trials. This additional testing will increase program expenses and extend timelines. We may decide to suspend further testing on our potential drug compounds if, in the judgment of our management and advisors, the non-clinical test results do not support further development.\nMoreover, success in non-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and non-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our potential drug compounds are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a drug candidate and may delay development of other potential drug compounds. Any delay in, or termination of, our non-clinical testing or clinical trials will delay the filing of an investigational new drug application and new drug application with the Food and Drug Administration or the equivalent applications with pharmaceutical regulatory authorities outside the United States and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our potential drug compounds and generate product revenues. In addition, we expect that our early clinical trials will involve small patient populations. Because of the small sample size, the results of these early clinical trials may not be indicative of future results.\nFollowing successful non-clinical testing, potential drug compounds will need to be tested in a clinical development program to provide data on safety and efficacy prior to becoming eligible for product approval and licensure by regulatory agencies. From the first human trial through to regulatory approval can take many years and 10-12 years is not unusual for certain compounds.\nIf any of our future clinical development potential drug compounds become the subject of problems, our ability to sustain our development programs will become critically compromised. For example, efficacy or safety concerns may arise, whether or not justified, that could lead to the suspension or termination of our clinical programs. Examples of problems that could arise include, among others:\n\u00b7 efficacy or safety concerns with the potential drug compounds, even if not justified;\n\u00b7 manufacturing difficulties or concerns;\n\u00b7 regulatory proceedings subjecting the potential drug compounds to potential recall;\n\u00b7 publicity affecting doctor prescription or patient use of the potential drug compounds;\n\u00b7 pressure from competitive products; or\n\u00b7 introduction of more effective treatments.\nEach clinical phase is designed to test attributes of the drug and problems that might result in the termination of the entire clinical plan can be revealed at any time throughout the overall clinical program. The failure to demonstrate efficacy in our clinical trials would have a material adverse effect on our future business prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we do not obtain the support of qualified scientific collaborators, our revenue, growth and profitability will likely be limited, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will need to establish relationships with leading scientists and research institutions. We believe that such relationships are pivotal to establishing products using our technologies as a standard of care for various indications. Additionally, although in discussion, there is no assurance that our current research partners will continue to work with us or that we will be able to attract additional research partners. If we are not able to establish scientific relationships to assist in our research and development, we may not be able to successfully develop our potential drug compounds. If this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop, market or generate sales of our products to the extent anticipated. Our business may fail and investors could lose all of their investment in our Company.\nAssuming that we are successful in developing our potential drug compounds and receiving regulatory clearances to market our products, our ability to successfully penetrate the market and generate sales of those products may be limited by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 If our competitors receive regulatory approvals for and begin marketing similar products in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories before we do, greater awareness of their products as compared to ours will cause our competitive position to suffer;\n\u00b7 Information from our competitors or the academic community indicating that current products or new products are more effective or offer compelling other benefits than our future products could impede our market penetration or decrease our future market share; and\n\u00b7 The pricing and reimbursement environment for our future products, as well as pricing and reimbursement decisions by our competitors and by payers, may have an effect on our revenues.\nIf this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nNone of our potential drug compounds may reach the commercial market for a number of reasons and our business may fail.\nSuccessful research and development of pharmaceutical products is high risk. Most products and development candidates fail to reach the market. Our success depends on the discovery of new drug compounds that we can commercialize. It is possible that our products may never reach the market for a number of reasons. They may be found ineffective or may cause harmful side-effects during non-clinical testing or clinical trials or fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals. We may find that certain products cannot be manufactured at a commercial scale and, therefore, they may not be economical to produce. Our potential products could also fail to achieve market acceptance or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties. Our patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property may be challenged and this may delay or prohibit us from effectively commercializing our products. Furthermore, we do not expect our potential drug compounds to be commercially available for a number of years, if at all. If none of our potential drug compounds reach the commercial market, our business will likely fail and investors will lose all of their investment in our Company. If this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nIf our competitors succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective or with a better profile than our own, or if scientific developments change our understanding of the potential scope and utility of our potential products, then our technologies and future products may be rendered undesirable or obsolete.\nWe face significant competition from industry participants that are pursuing technologies in similar disease states to those that we are pursuing and are developing pharmaceutical products that are competitive with our products. Nearly all of our industry competitors have greater capital resources, larger overall research and development staffs and facilities, and a longer history in drug discovery and development, obtaining regulatory approval and pharmaceutical product manufacturing and marketing than we do. With these additional resources, our competitors may be able to respond to the rapid and significant technological changes in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries faster than we can. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Rapid technological development, as well as new scientific developments, may result in our products becoming obsolete before we can recover any of the expenses incurred to develop them. For example, changes in our understanding of the appropriate population of patients who should be treated with a targeted therapy like we are developing may limit the drug\u2019s market potential if it is subsequently demonstrated that only certain subsets of patients should be treated with the targeted therapy.\nOur reliance on third parties, such as university laboratories, contract manufacturing organizations and contract or clinical research organizations, may result in delays in completing, or a failure to complete, non-clinical testing or clinical trials if they fail to perform under our agreements with them.\nIn the course of product development, we may engage university laboratories, other biotechnology companies or contract or clinical manufacturing organizations to manufacture drug material for us to be used in non-clinical and clinical testing and contract research organizations to conduct and manage non-clinical and clinical studies. If we engage these organizations to help us with our non-clinical and clinical programs, many important aspects of this process have been and will be out of our direct control. If any of these organizations we may engage in the future fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform non-clinical testing and/or clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, we may face delays in completing our clinical trials, as well as commercialization of any of our potential drug compounds. Furthermore, any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials, regulatory filings and the potential market approval of our potential drug compounds.\nIf we fail to compete successfully with respect to partnering, licensing, mergers, acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to research and develop our potential drug compounds.\nOur competitors compete with us to attract established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies or organizations for partnering, licensing, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations. Collaborations include contracting with academic research institutions for the performance of specific scientific testing. If our competitors successfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions, we will then be precluded from pursuing those specific opportunities. Since each of these opportunities is unique, we may not be able to find a substitute. Other companies have already begun many drug development programs, which may target diseases that we are also targeting, and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with academic research institutions, reducing the pool of available opportunities.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions also compete with us. While these organizations primarily have educational or basic research objectives, they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patent applications and patents that we may need for the development of our potential drug compounds. In some instances, we will attempt to license this proprietary technology, if available. These licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.\nThe use of any of our products in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims, which may cost us significant amounts of money to defend against or pay out, causing our business to suffer.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products. We currently have one drug compound in clinical trials, however, when any of our products enter into clinical trials or become marketed products, they could potentially harm people or allegedly harm people possibly subjecting us to costly and damaging product liability claims. Some of the patients who participate in clinical trials are already ill when they enter a trial or may intentionally or unintentionally fail to meet the exclusion criteria. The waivers we obtain may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability or the costs of product liability litigation. Although we intend to obtain product liability insurance which we believe is adequate, we are subject to the risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to cover claims. The insurance costs along with the defense or payment of liabilities above the amount of coverage could cost us significant amounts of money and management distraction from other elements of the business, causing our business to suffer.\nThe patent positions of biopharmaceutical products and processes are complex and uncertain and we may not be able to protect our patented or other intellectual property. If we cannot protect this property, we may be prevented from using it or our competitors may use it and our business could suffer significant harm. Also, the time and money we spend on acquiring and enforcing patents and other intellectual property will reduce the time and money we have available for our research and development, possibly resulting in a slow down or cessation of our research and development.\nWe hold ownership rights to three issued U.S. patent and six U.S. patent applications with various international counterpart applications, all of which relate to drug candidates. Neither patents nor patent applications ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including the following:\n1. Competitors may interfere with our patenting process in a variety of ways. Competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us. Competitors may also claim that we are infringing their patents and restrict our freedom to operate. Competitors may also contest our patents and patent applications, if issued, by showing in various patent offices that, among other reasons, the patented subject matter was not original, was not novel or was obvious. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our patents and patent applications are not valid or enforceable for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would lose some or all of our patent protection. As a company, we have no meaningful experience with competitors interfering with our patents or patent applications.\n2. Because of the time, money and effort involved in obtaining and enforcing patents, our management may spend less time and resources on developing potential drug compounds than they otherwise would, which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs.\n3. Issuance of a patent may not provide much practical protection. If we receive a patent of narrow scope, then it may be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe our patent(s).\n4. Our primary patent applications for ANAVEX 2-73 and the combination of ANAVEX 2-73 with donepezil are pending only in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The lack of patent protection in global markets may inhibit our ability to advance our compounds and may make Anavex less attractive to potential partners.\n5. Defending a patent lawsuit takes significant time and can be very expensive.\n6. If a court decides that our drug compound, its method of manufacture or use, infringes on the competitor\u2019s patent, we may have to pay substantial damages for infringement.\n7. A court may prohibit us from making, selling or licensing the potential drug compound unless the patent holder grants a license. A patent holder is not required to grant a license. If a license is available, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents, and the license terms may be unacceptable.\n8. Redesigning our potential drug compounds so that they do not infringe on other patents may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nIt is also unclear whether our trade secrets are adequately protected. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that someone illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational institutions. These research partners may be unable or unwilling to grant us exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations prior to entering into the relationship.\nIf we do not obtain required intellectual property licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or even be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling potential drug compounds requiring these rights or licenses. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or potential drug compounds developed in collaboration with other parties.\nOur substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations. Any refinancing of this substantial debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had total liabilities of $2,660,910 and accumulated deficit of $63,281,455. Our substantial indebtedness and other current financial obligations and any that we may become a party to in the future could:\n\u00b7 impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and affirmative and restrictive covenants in debt agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of a failure that is not cured or waived;\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow for interest payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionally less debt.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and other financial obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other financial transactions, seek additional equity capital, sell our assets or curtail our operations. We might then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell our assets on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, and/or incur significant transaction fees.\nIn the past we have experienced material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which if continued, could impair our financial condition.\nAs reported here in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2015. Such ineffectiveness was due to material weaknesses regarding our control environment (an insufficient segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel) and a lack of monitoring controls to determine the adequacy or our internal control over financial reporting and related policies. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible. We endeavor to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make improvements to remediate these deficiencies, and intend to consider the results of our remediation efforts and related testing as part of our year-end 2016 assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in light of our strategic plan and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. If we have continued material weaknesses in our internal financial reporting, our financial condition could be impaired.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our operations and would severely dilute existing or future investors if we were to raise funds at lower prices.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because our operations have been financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our continued operations. Any reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future would force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and would have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. We believe the following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate widely and could cause our common stock to trade at a price below the price at which you purchase your shares of common stock:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements of new services, products, acquisitions or strategic relationships by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting treatments or principles;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and in analyst recommendations; and\n\u00b7 general political, economic, regulatory and market conditions.\nThe market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of common stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock up to the authorized capital stated in the articles of incorporation. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares of common stock to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. The issuance of any such shares of common stock will result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we do issue any such additional shares of common stock, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation.\nTrading of our common stock may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nThere is currently a limited market for our common stock and the volume of our common stock traded on any day may vary significantly from one period to another. Trading in our stock is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. The availability of buyers and sellers represented by this volatility could lead to a market price for our common stock that is unrelated to operating performance. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in the stock, in which case it could be difficult for our stockholders to resell their stock.\nThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOn October 21, 2015, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d), pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to $50,000,000 of our common stock. Concurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to issue 179,598 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as a commitment fee and shall issue up to 89,799 shares pro rata, when and if, Lincoln Park purchases at the Company\u2019s discretion the $50,000,000 aggregate commitment. The purchase shares that may be sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period commencing after the SEC declared effective the related registration statement. The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nWe generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park, except that, pursuant to the terms of our agreements with Lincoln Park, we would be unable to sell shares to Lincoln Park if and when the closing sale price of our common stock is below $3.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Additional sales of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. Lincoln Park may ultimately purchase all of the shares of our common stock that may be sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and, after it has acquired shares, Lincoln Park may sell all, some or none of those shares. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.", "PERMNO": 15776, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AVXL"}
