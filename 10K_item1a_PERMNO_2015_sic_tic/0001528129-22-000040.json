{"cik": "1528129", "company": "Laredo Petroleum, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our shares could decline resulting in the loss of part or all of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the material risks and uncertainties we have identified, which should be read in conjunction with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nRisks related to our business\n\u2022Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses;\n\u2022Volatility in prices for oil, NGL and natural gas;\n\u2022Risks associated with spacing, drilling and completions techniques;\n\u2022Competition in the oil and gas industry;\n\u2022Risks in connection with acquisitions and disposition of assets;\n\u2022Risks associated with recent transactions and exposure to contingent liabilities;\n\u2022Changes in market/investor priorities;\n\u2022Uncertainties associated with estimating reserves and future net cash flows;\n\u2022Our ability to replace our oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022Insufficient transportation capacity in the Permian Basin and other risks associated with transportation and storage;\n\u2022Our level of success in development and production activities;\n\u2022The timing and occurrence of drilling future wells;\n\u2022Uncertainties associated with our use of 2D and 3D seismic analytics and other data;\n\u2022Inability of significant customers to meet their obligations;\n\u2022Unavailability or high cost of additional oilfield services;\n\u2022Cybersecurity threats and other disruptions in our electronic systems;\n\u2022Hydrocarbon price volatility as a result of Russian activities in Ukraine;\n\u2022Our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022New operational and technical issues;\n\u2022Conservation measures and market perception towards the Oil and Natural Gas Industry;\n\u2022The geographic concentration of our operations;\n\u2022Uncertainties associated with an ownership change;\n\u2022Incurrence of substantial losses and liability claims as a result of our oil and gas operations, and risks our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against these losses;\n\u2022Failure to effectively and timely address the energy transition; and\n\u2022Risks associated with our targets and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction.\nRisks related to our financing and indebtedness\n\u2022Our ability to obtain needed capital or financing;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain future hedges and effectiveness of our commodity derivative activities;\n\u2022Incurrence of significant additional amounts of debt;\n\u2022Cost and ability to access capital;\n\u2022Interest rate risk as a result of borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility;\n\u2022Our ability to generate cash;\n\u2022Reductions in our borrowing base under our Senior Secured Credit Facility;\n\u2022Losses from operations; and\n\u2022Debt covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nRisks related to regulation of our business\n\u2022Our ability to drill new allocation wells;\n\u2022Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells;\n\u2022Availability, use and disposal of water;\n\u2022Legislation or regulatory initiatives addressing seismic activity;\n\u2022Potential changes in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets;\n\u2022Adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d and potential physical effects of climate change;\n\u2022Significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements;\n\u2022Designation as \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d could subject us to additional regulation;\n\u2022Derivatives reform legislation and related regulations;\n\u2022Changes in tax laws and regulations; and\n\u2022Restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife.\nRisks related to our common stock\n\u2022Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware state law potentially delaying a change in control;\n\u2022Availability of shares for sale in the future; and\n\u2022We have no plans to pay and are currently restricted from paying dividends on our common stock.\nOur business and operations have been and will likely continue to be affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and responses.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus caused, and is continuing to cause, disruptions in the worldwide and U.S. economy. There are many variables and uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence, contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus and their severity; the effectiveness of treatments or vaccines against the virus or its new strains; the extent of travel restrictions, business closures and other measures that are or may be imposed in affected areas or countries by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain; an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; increased logistics costs; additional costs due to remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines and other COVID-19-related challenges; and decreases in the price of oil due to remote working arrangements. Further, there remain increased risks of cyberattacks on information technology systems used in remote working environment; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; absence of workforce due to illness; the impact of the pandemic on any of our contractual counterparties; and other factors that are currently unknown or considered immaterial. It is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the volatility in prices for oil, NGL and natural gas, we have taken and may be required to take further write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we have been required to, and may be required to further, write-down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Pricing and reserves\" and Note 6.a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nOil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile. Volatility in oil, NGL and natural gas prices has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations and may in the future affect our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments as well as negatively impact our stock price.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, NGL and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for oil, NGL and natural gas has been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a list of the factors that significantly impact our business and could impact our business in the future, including those specifically related to pricing and production.\nLower oil, NGL and natural gas prices have reduced, and may in the future continue to reduce, our cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves as existing reserves are depleted. A further decrease in oil, NGL and natural gas prices could render uneconomic a large portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects. This has already resulted in us having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and we may need to make further downward adjustments in the future. Furthermore, under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, scheduled borrowing base redeterminations occur by May 1 and November 1 of each year, and the lenders have the right to call for an interim redetermination of the borrowing base one time between any two scheduled redetermination dates and in other specified circumstances. A reduced borrowing base could trigger repayment obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Also, lower oil, NGL and natural gas prices would likely cause a decline in our stock price.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be successful in optimizing our spacing, drilling and completions techniques in order to maximize our rate of return, cash flows from operations and shareholder value.\nAs we accumulate and process geological and production data, we attempt to create a development plan, including well spacing and completion design, that maximizes our rate of return, cash flows from operations and shareholder value. However, due to many factors, including some beyond our control, there is no guarantee that we will be able to find the optimal plan or one that provides continuous improvement. If we are unable to design and implement an effective spacing, drilling and completions strategy, it may have a material adverse effect on our production results, financial performance, stock price and net asset value.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil, NGL and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional locations and to find and develop reserves in the future may depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive, concentrated geographic environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil, NGL and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil, NGL and natural gas industry, especially in our focus areas. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil, NGL and natural gas properties and exploratory locations and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective\nreserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and disposition of assets.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022recoverable reserves;\n\u2022future oil, NGL and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u2022timing of development;\n\u2022capital and operating costs; and\n\u2022potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe successful disposition of assets requires an assessment of several factors, including historical operations, potential environmental and other liabilities and impact on our business. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. Our assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller or buyer may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire or sell assets on an \"as is\" basis. Even in those circumstances in which we have contractual indemnification rights for pre-closing liabilities, it remains possible that the seller or buyer will not be able to fulfill its contractual obligations. Problems with assets we acquire or dispose of could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions may not achieve the intended results and our results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following such transactions.\nSome of the assumptions that we have made, such as the nature of assets to be acquired, may not be realized. There could also be undisclosed or unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition that were not discovered in the due diligence review conducted by us prior to entering into the transaction agreements.\nWe may use more cash and other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect. We may not be able to successfully integrate the assets acquired into our existing operations or realize the expected economic benefits of the acquisition, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn instances where a portion of the acreage we are acquiring is undeveloped, our plans, development schedule and production schedule associated with the acreage may fail to materialize. As a result, our investment in these areas may not be as economic as we anticipate, and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties.\nRecent transactions may expose us to contingent liabilities.\nWe have agreed to indemnify the sellers of assets in recent transactions against certain liabilities related to (i) production, processing and other imbalances, (ii) obligations to pay working interests and related payments, (iii) obligations for plugging and abandonment of applicable wells and (iv) certain other items. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer of assets for breaches of certain specified fundamental representations and warranties and failure to perform covenants or obligations contained in the respective transaction agreement, subject to certain limitations, and certain other indemnities.\nOur indemnification obligations are, in some cases, subject to limitations, but the amount of our maximum exposure could be material. In some instances, our indemnification obligations are not subject to any limitations. Significant indemnification claims by such sellers or buyers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to quickly adapt to changes in market/investor priorities.\nHistorically, one of the key drivers in the unconventional resource industry has been growth in production and reserves. With historical volatility in oil and natural gas prices and the likelihood that rising interest rates will increase the cost of borrowing,\ncapital efficiency and free cash flow from earnings have become the key drivers for energy companies, particularly shale producers. Such shifts in focus sometimes require changes in planning and resource management, which may not occur instantaneously. Any delay in responding to such changes in market sentiment or perception may result in the investment community having a negative sentiment regarding our business plan, potential profitability and our ability to operate in a manner deemed \"efficient,\" which may have a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nEstimating reserves and future net cash flows involves uncertainties. Negative revisions to reserve estimates, decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices or increases in service costs, may lead to decreased earnings and increased losses or impairment of oil and natural gas properties.\nThe reserves data included in this Annual Report represent estimates. Reserves estimation is a subjective process of evaluating underground accumulations of oil, NGL and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Reserves that are \"proved reserves\" are those estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and that relate to specific locations for which the extraction of hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain will commence within a five-year period.\nThe estimation process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including more rapid production declines than previously expected and many other factors beyond the control of the operator. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. Production declines may be rapid and irregular when compared to a well's initial production or initial estimates. In addition, the estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct.\nNegative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves have the effect of increasing the rates of depletion on the affected properties, which decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depletion expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also trigger impairment losses on certain properties, which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings. See Note 19.d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nUnless we replace our oil, NGL and natural gas production, our reserves and production will continue to decline, which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing oil, NGL and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by rapidly declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing exploration, development and exploitation activities and/or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will continue to decline as those reserves are produced. Our future oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nInsufficient transportation capacity in the Permian Basin, and the challenges to alleviating such transportation constraints, could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil prices and our results of operations.\nIn our area of operation, the Permian Basin has been characterized by periods when oil and/or natural gas production has surpassed local transportation capacity, resulting in substantial discounts to the price received for commodity prices quoted for WTI oil and Henry Hub natural gas. The expansion and construction of pipeline facilities are affected by the availability and costs of necessary equipment, supplies, labor and other services, as well as the length of time to complete such projects. In addition, these projects can be affected by changes in international trade relationships, including the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs relating to crude oil and natural gas and any materials or products used to expand or construct pipeline facilities, such as certain imported steel mill products that may be subject to a 25% tariff. All of these factors could negatively impact our realized oil prices, as well as actual results of our operations.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation, processing and storage, certain of which we do not control. If these services are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil, NGL and natural gas production depends on a variety of factors, including the availability, proximity, capacity and quality constraints of transportation, compression, natural gas processing, fractionation, export terminals and storage facilities owned by us or third parties. We do not control third-party facilities and pipelines that may be utilized for the transportation to market of the products originating at our leases. Our failure to provide or obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.\nInsufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by third parties or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third-party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil, NGL and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. If we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or specifications or encounter production-related difficulties, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. Any such shut-in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil, NGL and natural gas produced from our fields, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA decrease in our production of oil, NGL and natural gas could negatively impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations to deliver oil, NGL and natural gas and our ability to retain our leases.\nA portion of our oil, NGL and gas production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of extreme weather conditions, such as the freezing of wells and pipelines in the Permian Basin or a decision by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (\"ERCOT\") to implement statewide electricity blackouts due to supply/demand imbalances in the electricity grid caused by the extreme cold weather, accidents, loss or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system access and capacity, field labor issues or strikes. Alternatively, we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions, including low oil, NGL and gas prices. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow. Furthermore, if we were required to shut in wells, we might also be obligated to pay shut-in royalties to certain mineral interest owners to maintain our leases.\nIn addition, we have entered into agreements with third party pipelines and purchasers that require us to deliver for transportation or sale minimum amounts of oil and natural gas. Pursuant to these agreements, we must deliver specific amounts of oil or gas over the next eight years. If we are unable to fulfill all of our contractual delivery obligations from our own production, we may be required to pay penalties or damages pursuant to these agreements or we may have to purchase oil from third parties to fulfill our delivery obligations. This could adversely impact our cash flows, profit margins and net income.\nThe potential drilling locations that we have tentatively internally identified for our future wells will be drilled, if at all, over many years. This makes them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nAlthough our management team has established certain potential drilling locations as a part of our long-range development plan, our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil, NGL and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, our ability to leverage our data and development experience, the availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, gathering systems, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have currently identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, NGL or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, it is likely that our actual drilling activities, especially in the long term, could materially differ from those presently anticipated.\nOur use of 2D and 3D seismic, analytics and other data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil, NGL and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2D and 3D seismic data, analytics and other data that provide either visualization techniques and/or statistical analyses are only probability and estimation tools and do not ensure the existence of or the amount of hydrocarbons. We employ 3D seismic technology on certain of our projects, which is still relatively unproven. In addition, the use of 3D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional\ndrilling strategies, which may result in a reduction in our returns. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline.\nThe inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may materially adversely affect our financial results.\nOur oil, NGL and natural gas production sales are made to a variety of purchasers, including intrastate and interstate pipelines or their marketing affiliates and independent marketing companies. Certain purchasers individually account for 10% or more of our oil, NGL and natural gas sales in a given year. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. See Notes 2.d and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our accounts receivable and credit risk, respectively.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional oilfield services, including personnel, drilling rigs, equipment and supplies, as well as fees for the cancellation of such services, could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for and availability of qualified and experienced personnel to drill and complete wells and conduct field operations, including, but not limited to, frac crews, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil, NGL and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. From time to time, there have also been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe, sand, water and equipment as demand for such items has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. We have committed in the past, and we may in the future commit, to drilling rig contracts with various third parties that contain penalties for early terminations. These penalties could negatively impact our financial statements upon contract termination. Shortages in rigs, crews, supplies and equipment, as well as related fees could result in delays or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by disruption of electronic systems, security threats, including cyber-security threats, and other disruptions.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such systems or programs were to fail or we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil, NGL and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our or third-party facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. In particular, cyber-security attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by hydrocarbon price volatility as the result of, or as a result of the threat of, Russian activities in Ukraine and as the result of, or as a result of the threat of, Russia expanding its production of oil and gas to finance its activities in Ukraine and destabilize world energy markets.\nOur revenues and our profitability are heavily dependent on the prices we receive from our sales of oil and natural gas. Oil prices are particularly sensitive to actual and perceived threats to global political stability and to changes in production from OPEC member states. An actual increase, or the threat of an increase, in Russian activities in Ukraine could lead to increased volatility in global oil and gas prices and increases in oil production by Russia to finance its activities in Ukraine or to\ndestabilize global oil and gas prices could reduce the price we receive from our sales of oil and natural gas and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel and the failure to attract, train and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nEffective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management and technical personnel could hinder our strategic planning and execution and could have a material adverse impact on our operations. We do not maintain any key-man or similar insurance for any officer or other employee.\nWe may not always foresee new operational/technical issues as new technology enables greater operational capabilities.\nThe unconventional oil and natural gas industry has seen a large increase in new technologies to enhance all aspects of operations. This has arguably accelerated as a result of the extended downturn in commodity prices, forcing companies to find new ways to more efficiently produce oil and natural gas. While such technologies can and often ultimately enhance operations, production and profitability, the utilization of such technologies, especially in their early phases, may result in unforeseen consequences and operational issues, resulting in negative consequences.\nConservation measures, technological advances and negative shift in market perception towards the oil and natural gas industry could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices, and the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources such as electric vehicles, wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, fuel cells and biofuels) could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, our revenues.\nAdditionally, certain segments of the investor community have recently expressed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and natural gas industry. In the past, equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and natural gas representation in certain key equity market indices. Some investors, including certain pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to reduce or eliminate their investments in the oil and natural gas sector based on social and environmental considerations. Furthermore, certain other stakeholders have pressured commercial and investment banks to stop funding oil and gas projects. With the volatility in oil and natural gas prices, and the likelihood that interest rates will rise in the near term, increasing the cost of borrowing, certain investors have emphasized capital efficiency and free cash flow from earnings as key drivers for energy companies, especially shale producers. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, further impacting our future financial results.\nThe impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products, together with a change in investor sentiment, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, if we are unable to achieve the desired level of capital efficiency or free cash flow within the timeframe expected by the market, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur producing properties are in a concentrated geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2021, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional transportation constraints, supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing and storage capacity constraints, market limitations, water shortages, interruption of the processing or transportation of oil or natural gas, as well as impacts from extreme weather or other natural disasters impacting the Permian Basin, such as the freezing of wells and pipelines in the Permian Basin or a decision by ERCOT to implement statewide electricity blackouts due to supply/demand imbalances in the electricity grid caused by the extreme cold weather.\nIf we were to experience an ownership change, we could be limited in our ability to use net operating losses arising prior to the ownership change to offset future taxable income. In addition, our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if our taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards totaling $2.1 billion and state of Oklahoma NOL carryforwards totaling $34.6 million. If we were to experience an \"ownership change,\" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, to which Oklahoma conforms, our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with NOLs arising prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \"5% shareholders\" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period.\nIn addition, as a result of a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and the Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, and NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2018, are subject to different rules. NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, can generally be carried forward to offset future taxable income for a period of 20 years. Any NOL arising on or after January 1, 2018, while subject to additional limitations, can generally be carried forward indefinitely. Our ability to use our NOLs during this period will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income, and the NOLs could expire before we generate sufficient taxable income. As of December 31, 2021, based on evidence available to us, including projected future cash flows from our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and the timing of those cash flows, we believe a portion of our NOLs is not fully realizable. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, a valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings. Certain litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. Because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of pending and/or unexpected litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for a description of our pending litigation.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil, NGL and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil, NGL and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u2022abnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022disagreements regarding the royalty due to our royalty owners;\n\u2022personal injuries and death;\n\u2022electronic system disruption and cyber-security threats;\n\u2022natural disasters; and\n\u2022terrorist attacks targeting oil, NGL and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022pollution and other environmental damage and associated clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022regulatory investigations, penalties or other sanctions;\n\u2022suspension of our operations; and\n\u2022repair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The impact of litigation as well as the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could negatively impact our operations, business and financial condition.\nEffectively addressing the energy transition may require adapting our operations to changing local, state and federal requirements. While soliciting feedback from investors and other stakeholders to develop solutions to achieve our emissions targets may aide in effectively addressing the energy transition, should the transition occur faster than anticipated, or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail to effectively implement our emissions reduction strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in the oil and natural gas industry, our access to capital or the market for our securities may be negatively impacted.\nOur targets related to sustainability and emissions reduction initiatives, including our public statements and disclosures regarding them, may expose us to numerous risks.\nWe have developed, and will continue to develop, targets related to ESG initiatives, including our emissions reduction targets and strategy. Public statements related to these initiatives reflect our current plans and are not a guarantee the targets will be achieved or achieved on the stated timeline. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these targets may expose us to operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve our stated targets, including emissions reductions, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control.\nOur business may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our ESG initiatives, including our publicly announced targets, as well as our methodologies and timelines for pursuing those initiatives. If our ESG initiatives do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation, ability to attract or retain employees, and attractiveness as an investment or business partner may be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure to achieve our announced targets or comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, including reporting standards, may adversely impact our business. Furthermore, failure to achieve these targets within the announced timelines, or at all, may adversely affect our business or reputation, or may expose us to government enforcement actions or private litigation.\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur exploration, development, marketing, transportation and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, proceeds from equity offerings, proceeds from senior unsecured note offerings, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and proceeds from asset dispositions. We do not have commitments from anyone to contribute equity capital to us. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production from existing wells, prices of oil, NGL and natural gas and our success in developing and producing new reserves. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may have limited ability to obtain the additional capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all. The failure to obtain additional capital could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil, NGL and natural gas production or reserves and, in some areas, a loss of properties.\nCurrently, we receive a level of cash flow stability as a result of our hedging activity. To the extent we are unable to obtain future hedges at beneficial prices or our commodity derivative activities are not effective, our cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGL and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil, NGL and natural gas production, including puts, swaps, collars, basis swaps and, in the past, call spreads. In accordance with applicable accounting principles, we are required to record our derivatives at fair market value, and they are included on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities and in our consolidated statements of operations as gain (loss) on derivatives. Gain (loss) on derivatives are included in our cash flows from operating activities. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair market value of our derivative instruments, including a decrease in earnings if the price of commodities increases above the price of hedges that we have in place. As our current hedges expire, there is a significant uncertainty that we will be able to put new hedges in place that satisfy our hedge philosophy.\nDerivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022production is less than the volume covered by the commodity derivative instruments;\n\u2022the counter-party to the commodity derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u2022there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u2022there are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nIn addition, government regulation may adversely impact our ability to hedge these risks.\nFor additional information regarding our hedging activities, please see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Notes 10 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe may incur significant additional amounts of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total long-term indebtedness of $1.44 billion. We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, in the future. The restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness contained in the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes and in our Senior Secured Credit Facility are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we face would increase and may make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations. In addition, the restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness contained in the indentures governing the senior unsecured notes apply only to debt that constitutes indebtedness under the indentures. However, such increased debt may reduce the amount of outstanding debt allowed under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nIncreases in our cost of and ability to access capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flow and/or liquidity available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. An increase in interest rates on borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility would result in increased annual interest expense and a decrease in our income before income taxes. Disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our costs of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. Further, a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. A significant reduction in our cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest rate risk\" for additional information regarding interest rate risk. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our debt and borrowing base.\nBorrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility expose us to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an adjusted base rate tied to U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). USD LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on multiple factors, including general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which indicated plans for multiple interest rate increases in 2022, and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposure with respect to our fixed and/or floating rate debt. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, and the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after 2021, for all non-USD LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining USD LIBOR settings. In light of these recent announcements, the future of USD LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which USD LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to USD LIBOR\u2019s phase-out could cause USD LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. Our current credit agreement provides for any changes away from USD LIBOR to a successor rate to be based on prevailing or equivalent standards, however, changes in the method of calculating USD LIBOR, or the discontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future funding will be available to us under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, equity offerings or other actions in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity. We cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our Senior Secured Credit Facility as a result of a periodic borrowing base redetermination or otherwise will negatively impact our liquidity and, consequently, our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or any other obligation if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under our Senior Secured Credit Facility is currently subject to a borrowing base which is subject to scheduled semiannual (May 1 and November 1) and other elective borrowing base redeterminations based upon, among other things, projected revenues from, and asset values of, the oil and natural gas properties securing the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Reductions in estimates of our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves will result in a reduction in our borrowing base (if prices are kept constant). Reductions in our borrowing base could also arise from other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022lower commodity prices or production;\n\u2022increased leverage ratios;\n\u2022inability to drill or unfavorable drilling results;\n\u2022changes in oil, NGL and natural gas reserves engineering;\n\u2022increased operating and/or capital costs;\n\u2022the lenders' inability to agree to an adequate borrowing base; or\n\u2022adverse changes in the lenders' practices (including required regulatory changes) regarding estimation of reserves.\nWe anticipate borrowing under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in the future. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise will negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we could be required to repay the excess. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we keep cash at certain banks that are not FDIC insured or such deposits that exceed the FDIC insured amount. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and capital resources\" for additional information regarding our liquidity. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our debt and borrowing base.\nWe have incurred losses from operations for various periods since our inception and may do so in the future.\nWe incurred net losses in certain years of operation since our inception. Our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and factors described throughout this section may impede our ability to economically find, develop, exploit and acquire oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operating activities in the future. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical accounting estimates.\"\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes each contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nAs a result of these covenants and a covenant in our Senior Secured Credit Facility that limits our ability to hedge, we are limited in the manner in which we may conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or our capital needs. In addition, the covenants in our Senior Secured Credit Facility require us to maintain a minimum current ratio and maximum leverage ratio and also limit our capital expenditures. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross-default provisions and, in the case of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness, including the senior unsecured notes. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. If the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of the borrowings thereunder, the proceeds from the sale or foreclosure upon such assets will first be used to repay debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, and we may not have sufficient assets to repay our unsecured\nindebtedness thereafter. Our Senior Secured Credit Facility matures on July 16, 2025 (subject to a springing maturity date of July 29, 2024 if any of the January 2025 Notes are outstanding on such date).\nIf we are unable to drill new allocation wells, it could have a material adverse impact on our future production results.\nIn the State of Texas, allocation wells allow an oil and gas producer to drill a horizontal well under two or more leaseholds that are not pooled. We are active in drilling and producing allocation wells. If regulations regarding allocation wells are made, the RRC denies or significantly delays the permitting of allocation wells or if legislation is enacted that negatively impacts the current process under which allocation wells are permitted, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to drill long horizontal lateral wells on some of our leases, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our anticipated future production, rates of return and other projected capital efficiencies.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells could prohibit projects or result in materially increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays because of the significance of hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells in our business.\nHydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from tight formations. The process, which involves the injection of water, proppants and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal, state and local jurisdictions have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could further restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. See \"Item 1. Business-Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry-Hydraulic fracturing\" for a further description of federal and state regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, there are certain governmental reviews either under way or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices, which could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. Additional levels of regulation and permits required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing or water disposal wells are enacted into law.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water. New legislation and regulatory initiatives or restrictions relating to water disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWater is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners and other sources for use in our operations. Texas has previously experienced, and may experience again, low inflows of water. As a result of these conditions, some local water districts may begin restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in order to protect the local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, NGL and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our operational and production procedures produce large volumes of water that we must properly dispose. The Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") or the state. Furthermore, the State of Texas maintains groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions.\nBecause of the necessity to safely dispose of water produced during operational and production activities, these regulations, or others like them, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. See \"Item 1. Business-Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry\" for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing-related activities, particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In an effort to control induced seismic activity and recent increase in earthquakes in the Permian Basin, which have been linked by the U.S. and local seismologist to wastewater disposal in oil fields, in September 2021, the RRC curtailed the amount of produced water companies were permitted to inject into some wells in the Permian Basin, and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas.\nBecause we dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations, these restrictions on the use of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water wells, together with the adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations, could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or pump it through the pipeline network or other means, all of which could be costly. We or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, which may require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells. These factors may make drilling activity in the affected parts of the Permian Basin less economical and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 1. Business-Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry-Hydraulic fracturing\" for a further description of local regulations addressing seismic activity.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets, which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.\nSection 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the \"NGA\") exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\"). We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and, therefore, are exempt from the FERC's jurisdiction under the NGA. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a fact-based determination. The classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress, which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \"greenhouse gases\" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, NGL and natural gas we produce, while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nRestrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, NGL and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee \"Item 1. Business-Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry-\u201cGreenhouse gas\" emissions\" for a further discussion of the laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.\nOur operations may be exposed to significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities.\nWe may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration, development, marketing, transportation and production activities. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain and maintain a variety of permits, approvals, certificates or other authorizations governing our air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling, production and transporting product pipelines or other operations; regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, fracturing and completion processes; limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier, seismically active areas and other protected areas; require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; and/or impose substantial liabilities for spills, pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed, and, in some instances, the issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations.\nUnder certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability, we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. In addition, accidental spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities under environmental laws. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has tended to increase over time. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil, NGL and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSee \"Item 1. Business-Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry\" for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nDesignation as \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d could subject us to additional regulation, including potential weatherization requirements.\nIn response to Winter Storm Uri, the February 2021 winter weather event that caused widespread power failure to Texas\u2019 power grid for several days, the Texas legislature drafted new legislation designed to prepare for, prevent and respond to weather emergencies and power outages. On November 30, 2021, the RRC adopted rules to designate certain natural gas facilities as critical infrastructure. While the Commission did not adopt rules related to other sections of the legislation requiring such designees to implement weatherization measures, it is expected that the Commission will initiate a rulemaking at a later date for such purposes.\nUnder the new rules, \u201ccritical gas suppliers\u201d include, but are not limited to, gas wells, oil leases that produce gas, natural gas pipeline facilities, underground natural gas storage facilities and saltwater disposal facilities. \u201cCritical customers,\u201d which are a subset of critical gas suppliers, are facilities that require electricity to operate. The rules allow for certain facilities to apply for an exception to critical designation, but exclude certain types of highly critical facilities from eligibility for such exception.\nIf we are designated as a \u201ccritical gas supplier\u201d or \u201ccritical customer,\u201d we would become subject to additional regulation and compliance costs, including potential future operating and capital costs required to weatherize our assets.\nDerivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, the Adopted Derivatives Rules, and the U.S. Resolution Stay Rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. The Foreign Regulations could have similar effects. We have stopped entering into new hedging transactions with Foreign Counterparties and do not currently intend to resume hedging with Foreign Counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Adopted Derivatives Rules, the U.S. Resolution Stay Rules, and Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations. See \"Item 1. Business-Regulation of derivatives\" for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nTax laws and regulations may change over time, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including (i) the elimination of the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. The elimination of such U.S. federal tax deductions, as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in production, severance or similar taxes) could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil, NGL and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate, such as the dunes sagebrush lizard could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware state law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the market price of our capital stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power or economic value of our shares.\nIn addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022a separate vote of 75% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock in order for stockholders to amend the bylaws in certain circumstances;\n\u2022our board of directors is divided into three classes with each class serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022stockholders do not have the right to take any action by written consent; and\n\u2022advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nDelaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \"interested stockholder,\" meaning generally that a stockholder who owns 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as the approval of the transaction by our board of directors. Provisions such as these are also not favored by various institutional investor services, which may periodically \"grade\" us on various factors, including stockholder rights and corporate governance policies. Certain institutional investors may have internal policies that prohibit investments in companies receiving a certain grade level from such services, and if we fail to meet such criteria, it could limit the number or type of certain investors which might otherwise be attracted to an investment in the Company, potentially negatively impacting the public float and/or market price of our common stock.\nThe availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for acquisitions, to pay down debt, to fund capital expenditures or general corporate expenses, in connection with the exercise of stock options or to satisfy our obligations under our incentive plans. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our Company, reduce our earnings per share and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nBecause we have no plans to pay and are currently restricted from paying dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Covenants contained in our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes restrict the payment of dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13124, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LPI"}
