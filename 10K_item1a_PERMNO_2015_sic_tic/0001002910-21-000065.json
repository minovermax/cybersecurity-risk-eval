RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should review carefully the following material risk factors and the other information contained in this report. The risks that the Ameren Companies face are not limited to those in this section. There may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies.\nREGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our businesses.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local regulation. The extensive regulatory frameworks, some of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulate, among other matters, the electric and natural gas utility industries; the rate and cost structure of utilities, including an allowed ROE; the operation of nuclear power plants; the construction and operation of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities; the acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of assets and facilities; the electric transmission system reliability; and wholesale and retail competition. In the planning and management of our operations, we must address the effects of existing and proposed laws and regulations and potential changes in our regulatory frameworks, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, RTOs, utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Significant changes in the nature of the regulation of our businesses, including expiration of, or significant changes to, existing regulatory mechanisms, could require changes to our business planning and management of our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Failure to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner; failure to obtain necessary licenses or permits from regulatory authorities; the impact of new or modified laws, regulations, standards, interpretations, or other legal requirements; or increased compliance costs could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nThe electric and natural gas rates that we are allowed to charge are determined through regulatory proceedings, which are subject to intervention and appeal. Rates are also subject to legislative actions, which are largely outside of our control. Certain events could prevent us from recovering our costs in a timely manner or from earning adequate returns on our investments.\nThe rates that we are allowed to charge for our utility services significantly influence our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. The utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, and economic conditions, as well as social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding customer rates are largely outside of our control. We are exposed to regulatory lag and cost disallowances to varying degrees by jurisdiction, which, if unmitigated, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Rate orders are also subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that we will ultimately be allowed to charge for our services. From time to time, our regulators may approve trackers, riders, or other recovery mechanisms that allow electric or natural gas rates to be adjusted without a traditional regulatory rate review. These mechanisms could be changed or terminated.\nAmeren Missouri\u2019s electric and natural gas utility rates and Ameren Illinois\u2019 natural gas utility rates are typically established in regulatory proceedings that take up to 11 months to complete. Ameren Missouri\u2019s rates established in those proceedings are primarily based on historical costs and revenues. Ameren Illinois\u2019 natural gas rates established in those proceedings are based on estimated future costs and revenues. Thus, the rates that we are allowed to charge for utility services may not match our actual costs at any given time.\nRates include an allowed return on investments established by the regulator, including a return at the applicable WACC on rate base, and an amount for income taxes based on the currently applicable statutory income tax rates and amortization associated with excess deferred income taxes. Although rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on rate base, there can be no assurance that the regulator will determine that our costs were prudently incurred or that the regulatory process will result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs or provide for an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on those investments. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, and the utility industry generally, have an increased need for cost recovery, primarily driven by capital investments, which is likely to continue in the future. The resulting increase to the revenue requirement needed to recover such costs and earn a return on investments could result in more frequent regulatory rate reviews and requests for cost recovery mechanisms. Additionally, increasing rates could result in regulatory or legislative actions, as well as competitive or political pressures, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nAs a result of its participation in performance-based formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois\u2019 ROE for its electric distribution service and its electric energy-efficiency investments is directly correlated to yields on United States Treasury bonds. Additionally, Ameren Illinois is required to achieve certain performance standards. With respect to its natural gas delivery service business, unless extended, Ameren Illinois\u2019 QIP will sunset after December 2023.\nAmeren Illinois elects to participate in a performance-based formula ratemaking framework established pursuant to the IEIMA for its electric distribution service. Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric distribution revenues are decoupled from sales volumes, which ensures that the electric distribution revenues authorized in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes. Ameren Illinois also has an electric energy-efficiency program rider, which includes a return at the applicable WACC on its program investments that is subject to performance-based formula ratemaking. The ICC annually reviews Ameren Illinois\u2019 rate filings for reasonableness and prudency. If the ICC were to conclude that Ameren Illinois\u2019 costs were not prudently incurred, the ICC would disallow recovery of such costs. The electric distribution service performance-based formula ratemaking framework expires at the end of 2022, if not extended by the legislature, while the decoupling provisions extend beyond the end of formula ratemaking by law. If the performance-based formula ratemaking framework is not extended or if Ameren Illinois elects not to participate, Ameren Illinois would then be required to establish future rates through a traditional regulatory rate review with the ICC, which might result in rates that do not produce a full or timely recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on investments and would expose Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric distribution business to the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor.\nThe allowed ROE under both formula ratemaking recovery mechanisms is based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. Therefore, Ameren Illinois\u2019 annual ROE for its electric distribution business is directly correlated to the yields on such bonds, which are outside of Ameren Illinois\u2019 control. With respect to electric distribution service, a 50 basis point change in the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds would result in an estimated $10 million change in Ameren\u2019s and Ameren Illinois\u2019 annual net income, based on its 2021 projected rate base.\nAmeren Illinois is also subject to performance standards. Failure to achieve the standards would result in a reduction in the company\u2019s allowed ROE calculated under the ratemaking formulas. The performance standards applicable to electric distribution service include improvements in service reliability to reduce both the frequency and duration of outages, a reduction in the number of estimated bills, a reduction of consumption from inactive meters, and a reduction in bad debt expense. The electric distribution service regulatory framework provides for ROE penalties up to 38 basis points annually in 2021 and 2022 if these performance standards are not met. The allowed ROE on energy-efficiency investments can be increased or decreased up to 200 basis points, depending on the achievement of annual energy savings goals. Any adjustments to the allowed ROE for energy-efficiency investments will depend on annual performance for a historical period relative to energy savings goals. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were no performance-related basis point adjustments that materially affected financial results.\nAmeren Illinois plans to invest up to approximately $100 million per year in electric energy-efficiency programs through 2025, and will earn a return on those investments. While the ICC has approved a plan consistent with this spending level through 2021, the ICC has the ability to reduce the amount of electric energy-efficiency savings goals in future plan program years if there are insufficient cost-effective programs available, which could reduce the investments in electric energy-efficiency programs.\nThe QIP provides Ameren Illinois with recovery of, and a return on, qualifying natural gas infrastructure investments that are placed in service between regulatory rate reviews. Infrastructure investments under the QIP earn a return at the applicable WACC. Ameren Illinois\u2019 QIP is subject to a rate impact limitation of a cumulative 4% per year since the most recent delivery service rate order, with no single year exceeding 5.5%. If the rate impact limitation was met in a particular year, the amount of rate base causing the QIP rate to exceed the limitation would be exposed to regulatory lag until a year when that amount could be recovered under QIP or is added to rate base as a part of a regulatory rate review. Upon issuance of a natural gas delivery service rate order, QIP rate base is transferred to base rates and the QIP is reset to zero. Without legislative action, the QIP will sunset after December 2023. If the QIP is not extended or there is no other regulatory change, Ameren Illinois will be subject to regulatory lag on its natural gas infrastructure investments that are placed in service between regulatory rate reviews, which could adversely affect Ameren Illinois\u2019 results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nAs a result of the election to use the PISA, Ameren Missouri\u2019s electric rates are subject to a rate cap.\nAs a result of Ameren Missouri\u2019s election to use the PISA, its rate increases are limited to a 2.85% compound annual growth rate in the average overall customer rate per kilowatthour, based on the electric rates that became effective in April 2017, less half of the annual savings from the TCJA that was passed on to customers as approved in the July 2018 MoPSC order. Both the rate cap and the PISA election are effective through December 2023, unless Ameren Missouri requests and receives MoPSC approval of an extension through December 2028.\nIf rate changes from the FAC or the RESRAM riders would cause rates to temporarily exceed the 2.85% rate cap, the overage would be deferred for future recovery in the next regulatory rate review; however, rates established in such regulatory rate review would be subject to the rate cap. Any deferred overages approved for recovery would be recovered in a manner consistent with costs recovered under the PISA. Increased capital investments and operating costs could cause customer rates to exceed the rate cap. In addition, a decrease in off-system sales, which are included in net energy costs, could also contribute to customer rates exceeding the rate cap. Off-system sales are affected by planned and unplanned outages at Ameren Missouri\u2019s energy centers, and by curtailment of generation resulting from unfavorable economic conditions, among other things. Excluding customer rates under the MEEIA rider, which are not subject to the rate cap, Ameren Missouri would incur a penalty equal to the amount of deferred overage that would cause customer rates to exceed the 2.85% rate cap. A penalty incurred as the result of exceeding the rate cap could adversely affect Ameren\u2019s and Ameren Missouri\u2019s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws. Significant capital expenditures are required to achieve and to maintain compliance with these environmental laws. Failure to comply with these laws could result in the closing of facilities, alterations to the manner in which these facilities operate, increased operating costs, delays and increased costs of building new facilities, or exposure to fines and liabilities.\nOur electric generation, transmission, and distribution operations and natural gas transmission, distribution, and storage operations must comply with a variety of environmental laws that are enforced through statutory and regulatory requirements including permitting programs implemented by federal, state, and local authorities. Depending upon the business activity of specific facilities, such laws address emissions; discharges to water bodies; the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; siting and land use requirements; and potential ecological impacts. Complex and lengthy processes are required to obtain and renew approvals, permits, and licenses for new, existing, or modified facilities. Additionally, the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency response procedures. Further, we are subject to risks from changing or conflicting interpretations of existing laws, modification to existing laws, and new laws.\nWe are also subject to liability under environmental laws that address the remediation of environmental contamination on property currently or formerly owned by us or by our predecessors, as well as property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. Such properties include MGP sites and third-party sites, such as landfills. Additionally, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws against us. They could allege injury from exposure to hazardous materials, allege a failure to comply with environmental laws, seek to compel remediation of environmental contamination, or seek to recover damages resulting from that contamination.\nEnvironmental regulations have a significant impact on the electric utility industry and compliance with these regulations could be costly for Ameren Missouri, which operates coal-fired power plants. As of December 31, 2020, Ameren Missouri\u2019s coal-fired energy centers represented 11% and 23% of Ameren\u2019s and Ameren Missouri\u2019s rate base, respectively. Clean Air Act regulations that apply to the electric utility industry include the NSPS, the CSAPR, the MATS, and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are subject to periodic review for certain pollutants. Collectively, these regulations cover a variety of pollutants, such as SO2, particulate matter, NOx, mercury, toxic metals, and acid gases, and CO2 emissions from new power plants. Clean Water Act regulations govern both water intake and discharges from power plants and require evaluation of the ecological and biological impact of our operations and could require modifications to water intake structures or more stringent limitations on wastewater discharges at Ameren Missouri\u2019s energy centers. Depending upon the scope of modifications ultimately required by state regulators, these capital expenditures could be significant. The management and disposal of coal ash is regulated as a solid waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the CCR rule, which require the closure of our surface impoundments at Ameren Missouri\u2019s coal-fired energy centers. The individual or combined effects of existing and new environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of operations at some of Ameren Missouri\u2019s energy centers.\nIn January 2011, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against Ameren Missouri in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri alleging that in performing projects at its coal-fired Rush Island Energy Center in 2007 and 2010, Ameren Missouri violated provisions of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law. In January 2017, the district court issued a liability ruling and, in September 2019, entered a final order that required Ameren Missouri to install a flue gas desulfurization system at the Rush Island Energy Center and a dry sorbent injection system at the Labadie Energy Center. There were no fines in the order. In October 2019, Ameren Missouri appealed the district court\u2019s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The district court has stayed implementation of the majority of the requirements of its order while the case is under appeal. The ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material\nadverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri. Among other things and subject to economic and regulatory considerations, resolution of this matter could result in increased capital expenditures for the installation of air pollution control equipment, as well as increased operations and maintenance expenses. Based upon engineering studies from October 2019, capital expenditures to comply with the district court\u2019s order for installation of a flue gas desulfurization system at the Rush Island Energy Center are estimated at approximately $1 billion. Further, the flue gas desulfurization system would result in additional operation and maintenance expenses of $30 million to $50 million annually for the life of the energy center. Engineering studies required to develop estimated capital expenditures and estimated additional operation and maintenance expenses for the Labadie Energy Center to comply with the district court\u2019s order will not be undertaken while the case is under appeal.\nThe EPA\u2019s Affordable Clean Energy Rule repealed the Clean Power Plan and replaced it with a new rule that had established emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to limit CO2 emissions and identified certain efficiency measures as the best system of emission reduction for coal-fired electric generating units. In January 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, and ruled that the EPA had the discretion to consider emission reduction measures that include efficiency measures and generation shifting to lower carbon emissions. Additional litigation including reconsideration by the entire United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or an appeal to the United States Supreme Court is possible. Regardless of the outcome of such potential legal challenges, the EPA is likely to develop new regulations to address carbon emissions from coal and natural gas electric generating units, which could take years to finalize. At this time, Ameren Missouri cannot predict the outcome of legal challenges or future rulemakings. As such, the impact on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri is uncertain.\nAmeren and Ameren Missouri have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs with respect to environmental compliance and site remediation. New or revised environmental regulations, enforcement initiatives, or legislation could result in a significant increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, decreased revenues, increased financing requirements, penalties or fines, or reduced operations of some of Ameren Missouri\u2019s coal-fired energy centers, which, in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs. Actions required to ensure that Ameren Missouri\u2019s facilities and operations are in compliance with environmental laws could be prohibitively expensive for Ameren Missouri if the costs are not fully recovered through rates. Environmental laws could require Ameren Missouri to close or to alter significantly the operations of its energy centers. If Ameren Missouri requests recovery of capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance through rates, the MoPSC could deny recovery of all or a portion of these costs, prevent timely recovery, or make changes to the regulatory framework in an effort to minimize rate volatility and customer rate increases. Capital expenditures and costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might result in Ameren Missouri closing coal-fired energy centers earlier than planned. If these costs are not recoverable through rates, it could lead to an impairment of assets and reduced revenues. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial positions, and liquidity.\nWe are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings, which could result in increasing costs and the potential for regulatory penalties and other sanctions.\nWe are subject to FERC regulations, rules, and orders, including standards required by the NERC. As owners and operators of bulk power transmission systems and electric energy centers, we are subject to mandatory NERC reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. In addition, our natural gas transmission, distribution, and storage facilities systems are subject to PHMSA rules and regulations. Compliance with these reliability standards, rules, and regulations may subject us to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. We may also incur higher operating costs to comply with potential new regulations issued by these regulatory bodies. If we were found not to be in compliance with these mandatory NERC reliability standards, PHMSA rules and regulations, or FERC regulations, rules, and orders, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The FERC can impose civil penalties of approximately $1.3 million per violation per day for violation of its regulations, rules, and orders, including mandatory NERC reliability standards. The FERC also conducts audits and reviews of Ameren Missouri\u2019s, Ameren Illinois\u2019, and ATXI\u2019s accounting records to assess the accuracy of their respective formula ratemaking process, and it can require refunds to customers for previously billed amounts, with interest.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur results of operations, financial position, and liquidity have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the international public health emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a constantly evolving situation. In 2020, we experienced a net decrease in our sales volumes, an increase in our accounts receivable balances that were past due or that were a part of a deferred payment arrangement, and a decline in our cash collections from customers. The continued effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity in subsequent periods will depend on its severity and longevity, future regulatory or legislative actions with respect thereto, and the resulting impact on business, economic, and capital market conditions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, measures have been taken by local, state, and federal governments, such as travel bans, quarantines, and shelter-in place orders. Shelter-in-place orders began taking\neffect in our service territories in mid-March 2020. These orders generally required individuals to remain at home and precluded or limited the operation of businesses that were deemed nonessential. In mid-May 2020, shelter-in-place orders effective in our service territories began to be relaxed, with individuals allowed to leave their homes and nonessential businesses allowed to begin reopening. However, certain restrictions remain in place that limit individual activities and the operation of nonessential businesses. Additional restrictions may be imposed in the future. Ameren\u2019s business operations are deemed essential and are not directly impacted by the shelter-in-place orders. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic activity has been disrupted in the service territories of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. It has also caused disruptions in the capital markets, which could adversely affect our ability to access these markets on reasonable terms and when needed. These disruptions could continue for a prolonged period of time or become more severe.\nWe rely on the issuance of short-term and long-term debt and equity as significant sources of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flow, as well as to refinance existing long-term debt. Disruptions to the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our businesses. In addition, our credit ratings may be impacted by the economic conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to events beyond our control, such as further depressed economic conditions or extreme volatility in the debt, equity, or credit markets, and might create uncertainty that could increase our cost of capital or impair or eliminate our ability to access the debt, equity, or credit markets, including our ability to draw on bank credit facilities or issue commercial paper.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced and expect to continue to experience changes to our sales volumes. In 2020, compared to 2019, Ameren Missouri experienced a reduction in commercial and industrial electric sales volumes, partially offset by increased electric sales volumes to higher margin residential customers, excluding the estimated effects of weather and customer energy-efficiency programs. The COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect Ameren Missouri\u2019s total electric sales volumes and sales volumes by customer class beyond 2020. Assuming a ratable change in Ameren Missouri\u2019s electric sales volumes by month, a 1% change for the calendar year 2021 to residential, commercial, and industrial customers would affect earnings per diluted share by approximately 3 cents, 2 cents, and a half-cent, respectively. The actual change in earnings per diluted share will be affected by the timing of sales volume changes due to seasonal customer rates. Pursuant to the PISA, Ameren Missouri\u2019s electric rates are limited to a 2.85% compound annual growth rate cap. Continued long-term declines in sales volumes, along with increased capital investments and operating costs, could result in Ameren Missouri\u2019s inability to recover amounts exceeding the rate cap. Ameren Illinois also experienced decreases in electric and natural gas sales volumes in 2020. While the revenues from Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric distribution business, residential and small nonresidential customers of Ameren Illinois\u2019 natural gas distribution business, and Ameren Illinois\u2019 and ATXI\u2019s electric transmission businesses are decoupled from changes in sales volumes, changes in sales volumes at Ameren Missouri and those associated with Ameren Illinois\u2019 large nonresidential natural gas customers may affect net income.\nOur customers\u2019 payment for our services has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a decrease to our cash flow from operations. Ameren Missouri suspended disconnections for customer nonpayment and late fees in mid-March 2020, and resumed those activities for commercial and industrial customers in mid-July 2020 and residential customers in early August 2020. Ameren Illinois resumed disconnection activities for commercial and industrial customers for nonpayment in early August 2020 and residential customers in mid-September 2020, with the exception of residential customers classified as low income, expressing a financial hardship, or relying on medical equipment. Disconnections for nonpayment for these and all other residential customers are expected to begin in April 2021, which is after the annual winter moratorium period on disconnections that ends March 31, 2021. Ameren Illinois began the winter moratorium on November 18, 2020, which has historically started at the beginning of December. Ameren Illinois also resumed charging late fees to all customers in late July 2020, following the suspension of both disconnections and late fees for all customers in mid-March 2020. Future regulatory or legislative action could require suspension of customer disconnections and/or late fees, among other things, for an extended period of time. As of December 31, 2020, accounts receivable balances that were 30 days or greater past due or that were a part of a deferred payment arrangement represented 29%, 22%, and 35%, or $133 million, $40 million, and $93 million, of Ameren\u2019s, Ameren Missouri\u2019s, and Ameren Illinois\u2019 customer trade receivables before allowance for doubtful accounts, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, these percentages were 18%, 18%, and 20%, or $75 million, $30 million, and $45 million, for Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois, respectively. Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric distribution and natural gas distribution businesses have bad debt riders, which provide for recovery of bad debt write-offs, net of any subsequent recoveries. Pursuant to a June 2020 ICC order, Ameren Illinois\u2019 electric bad debt rider provided for the recovery of bad debt expense in 2020, which reverted to the recovery of bad debt write-offs, net of any subsequent recoveries, in 2021. Ameren Missouri does not have a bad debt rider or tracker, and thus its earnings are exposed to increases in bad debt expense, absent regulatory relief. However, Ameren Missouri does not expect a material impact to earnings from increases in bad debt expense. While Ameren Missouri is seeking recovery of certain COVID-19 pandemic related costs incurred, net of savings, and forgone customer late revenues, it could be unsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval to recover them, which may adversely affect Ameren and Ameren Missouri\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition, suppliers and contractors may not perform as provided under their contracts. This could cause delays in construction projects, or the performance of necessary maintenance to our electric and natural gas infrastructure, which could lead to failures of equipment that can result in unanticipated liabilities or unplanned outages. Delays in our construction projects could also result in reduced planned capital expenditures and decreased rate base growth.\nAlso, our businesses depend on skilled professional and technical employees. Our operations could be adversely affected if a large portion of our employees contracted COVID-19 or became quarantined at the same time. This could lead to facility shutdowns and disruptions in the delivery of electricity and natural gas to our customers. In addition, remote working arrangements increase our data security risks, including loss of data related to sensitive customer, employee, financial, and operating system information, through insider or outsider actions.\nAmeren cannot predict the extent or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or its effects on the global, national, or local economy, the capital markets, or its customers, suppliers, business continuity plans, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, planned rate base growth, or sales volumes.\nThe construction and acquisition of, and capital improvements to, electric and natural gas utility infrastructure, along with Ameren Missouri\u2019s ability to implement its Smart Energy Plan, which is aligned with its 2020 IRP, involve substantial risks.\nWe expect to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure and to comply with existing environmental regulations. We estimate that we will invest up to $17.8 billion (Ameren Missouri - up to $9.3 billion; Ameren Illinois - up to $8.2 billion; ATXI - up to $0.2 billion) of capital expenditures from 2021 through 2025. For additional information on these estimates, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report. Investments in Ameren\u2019s rate-regulated operations are expected to be recoverable from customers, but they are subject to prudence reviews and are exposed to regulatory lag of varying degrees by jurisdiction.\nOur ability to complete construction projects successfully within projected estimates, including schedule, performance, and/or cost, and to implement Ameren Missouri\u2019s Smart Energy Plan, which may include acquisition of generation facilities after they are constructed, is contingent upon many factors and subject to substantial risks. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: project management expertise; escalating costs and/or shortages for labor, materials, and equipment, including changes to tariffs on materials; the ability of suppliers, contractors, and developers to meet contractual commitments timely; changes in the scope and timing of projects; the ability to obtain required regulatory, project, and permit approvals; the ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements, and transmission connections at an acceptable cost in a timely fashion; unsatisfactory performance by the projects when completed; the inability to earn an adequate return on invested capital; the ability to raise capital on reasonable terms; and other events beyond our control, including construction delays due to weather. With respect to the transition of Ameren Missouri\u2019s generation fleet and achievement of the carbon emission reduction targets outlined in the 2020 IRP, factors also include MoPSC approval for the retirement of energy centers and new or continued customer energy-efficiency programs; the cost of wind, solar, and other renewable generation and storage technologies; the ability to qualify for, and use, federal production or investment tax credits; changes in environmental laws or requirements, including those related to carbon emissions; and energy prices and demand.\nAny of these risks could result in higher costs, the inability to complete anticipated projects, or facility closures, and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nOur electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to operational risks.\nOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities involves many risks, including:\n\u2022facility shutdowns due to operator error, or a failure of equipment or processes;\n\u2022longer-than-anticipated maintenance outages;\n\u2022failures of equipment that can result in unanticipated liabilities or unplanned outages, such as the unplanned outage resulting from non-nuclear operating issues related to the Callaway Energy Center\u2019s generator;\n\u2022aging infrastructure that may require significant expenditures to operate and maintain;\n\u2022an energy center that might not be permitted to continue to operate if pollution control equipment is not installed by prescribed deadlines or does not perform as expected;\n\u2022lack of adequate water required for cooling plant operations;\n\u2022labor disputes;\n\u2022disruptions in the delivery of electricity to our customers;\n\u2022suppliers and contractors who do not perform as required under their contracts;\n\u2022failure of other operators\u2019 facilities and the effect of that failure on our electric system and customers;\n\u2022inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, including those relating to environmental laws;\n\u2022handling, storage, and disposition of CCR;\n\u2022unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters, including severe storms, droughts, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, sustained high or low temperatures, icing, solar flares, and electromagnetic pulses, such as the extremely low temperatures experienced in mid-February 2021;\n\u2022the level of wind and solar resources;\n\u2022inability to operate wind generation facilities at full capacity resulting from requirements to protect natural resources, including wildlife;\n\u2022the occurrence of catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, acts of sabotage or terrorism, civil unrest, pandemic health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar events;\n\u2022accidents that might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage, or environmental damage;\n\u2022ineffective vegetation management programs;\n\u2022cybersecurity risks, including loss of operational control of Ameren Missouri\u2019s energy centers and our transmission and distribution systems and loss of data, including sensitive customer, employee, financial, and operating system information, through insider or outsider actions;\n\u2022limitations on amounts of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operating our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities;\n\u2022inability to implement or maintain information systems;\n\u2022failure to keep pace with and the ability to adapt to rapid technological change; and\n\u2022other unanticipated operations and maintenance expenses and liabilities.\nThe foregoing risks could affect the controls and operations of our facilities or impede our ability to meet regulatory requirements, which could increase operating costs, increase our capital requirements and costs, reduce our revenues, or have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nAmeren Missouri\u2019s ability to obtain an adequate supply of coal could limit operation of its coal-fired energy centers.\nAmeren Missouri owns and operates coal-fired energy centers. About 97% of Ameren Missouri\u2019s coal is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, which has a limited number of suppliers. Deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail congestion and maintenance, derailments, weather, and supplier financial hardship. Coal suppliers in the Power River Basin are experiencing financial hardship because of a decrease in demand resulting from increased natural gas and renewable energy generation, and the impact of environmental regulations, as well as concerns related to coal-fired generation. These financial hardships have resulted in bankruptcy filings by certain coal suppliers in recent years. As of December 31, 2020, coal inventories for Ameren Missouri were near targeted levels. However, disruptions in the delivery of coal, failure of our coal suppliers to provide adequate quantities or quality of coal, or lack of adequate inventories of coal, including low-sulfur coal used to comply with environmental regulations, could have adverse effects on Ameren Missouri\u2019s electric generation operations. If Ameren Missouri is unable to obtain an adequate supply of coal under existing agreements, it may be required to purchase coal at higher prices or be forced to reduce generation at its coal-fired energy centers, which could adversely affect Ameren\u2019s and Ameren Missouri\u2019s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nAmeren Missouri\u2019s ownership and operation of a nuclear energy center creates business, financial, and waste disposal risks.\nAmeren Missouri\u2019s ownership of the Callaway Energy Center subjects it to risks associated with nuclear generation, including:\n\u2022potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from radiological releases associated with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive materials;\n\u2022continued uncertainty regarding the federal government\u2019s plan to permanently store spent nuclear fuel and, as a result, the need to provide for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Callaway Energy Center;\n\u2022limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the Callaway Energy Center or other United States nuclear facilities;\n\u2022uncertainties about contingencies and retrospective premium assessments relating to claims at the Callaway Energy Center or any other United States nuclear facilities;\n\u2022public and governmental concerns about the safety and adequacy of security at nuclear facilities;\n\u2022limited availability of fuel supply and our reliance on licensed fuel assemblies from the one NRC-licensed supplier of Callaway Energy Center\u2019s assemblies;\n\u2022costly and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance and refueling;\n\u2022uncertainties about the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their licensed lives;\n\u2022the adverse effect of poor market performance and other economic factors on the asset values of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the corresponding increase, upon MoPSC approval, in customer rates to fund the estimated decommissioning costs; and\n\u2022potential adverse effects of a natural disaster, acts of sabotage or terrorism, including a cyber attack, or any accident leading to a radiological release.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety requirements for nuclear facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or to shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated from time to time by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at the Callaway Energy Center. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could adversely affect Ameren\u2019s and Ameren Missouri\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere\nin the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation of any domestic nuclear unit and could also cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or requirements on the industry, which could increase costs and result in additional capital expenditures. NRC standards relating to seismic risk require Ameren Missouri to further evaluate the impact of an earthquake on its Callaway Energy Center due to its proximity to a fault line, which could require the installation of additional capital equipment.\nOur natural gas distribution and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and increased operating costs.\nInherent in our natural gas distribution and storage activities are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and cybersecurity risks, which could cause substantial financial losses, including fines and penalties. In addition, these hazards could result in serious injury, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental impacts, and impairment of our operations, which in turn could lead us to incur substantial losses. The location of distribution mains and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, business centers, industrial sites, and other public gathering places, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. A major domestic incident involving natural gas distribution, and storage systems could result in additional capital expenditures and/or increased operations and maintenance expenses for us and increased regulation of natural gas utilities. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nSignificant portions of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and natural gas transmission and distribution facilities are aging. This aging infrastructure may require significant additional maintenance or replacement. Ameren Missouri could be adversely affected if it is unable to recover the remaining investment, if any, and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of an energy center, as well as the ability to earn a return on that remaining investment and those decommissioning costs.\nOur aging infrastructure may pose risks to system reliability and expose us to expedited or unplanned significant capital expenditures and operating costs. All of Ameren Missouri\u2019s coal-fired energy centers were constructed prior to 1978, and the Callaway Energy Center began operating in 1984. The age of these energy centers increases the risks of unplanned outages, reduced generation output, and higher maintenance expense. Further, Ameren Missouri would be adversely affected if the MoPSC does not allow recovery of the remaining investment and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of an energy center, as well as the ability to earn a return on that remaining investment and those decommissioning costs. As indicated it its 2020 IRP, Ameren Missouri intends to advance the retirement dates of the Sioux and Rush Island coal-fired energy centers to 2028 and 2039, respectively, which are subject to the approval of a change in the assets\u2019 depreciable lives by the MoPSC in a future regulatory rate review. Aging transmission and distribution facilities are more prone to failure than new facilities, which results in higher maintenance expense and the need to replace these facilities with new infrastructure. Even if the system is properly maintained, its reliability may ultimately deteriorate and negatively affect our ability to serve our customers, which could result in increased costs associated with regulatory oversight. The frequency and duration of customer outages are among the IEIMA performance standards. Any failure to achieve these standards will result in a reduction in Ameren Illinois\u2019 allowed ROE on electric distribution assets. The higher maintenance costs associated with aging infrastructure and capital expenditures for new or replacement infrastructure could cause additional rate volatility for our customers, resistance by our regulators to allow customer rate increases, and/or regulatory lag in some of our jurisdictions, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nEnergy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, technological advances, and other factors could reduce energy demand from our customers.\nWithout a regulatory mechanism to ensure recovery, declines in energy usage could result in an under-recovery of our revenue requirement or an increase in our customer rates, as the revenue requirement would be spread over less sales volumes, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Such declines could occur due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022customer energy-efficiency programs that are designed to reduce energy demand;\n\u2022energy-efficiency efforts by customers not related to our energy-efficiency programs;\n\u2022increased customer use of distributed generation sources, such as solar panels and other technologies, which have become more cost-competitive, with decreasing costs expected in the future, as well as the use of energy storage technologies; and\n\u2022macroeconomic factors resulting in low economic growth or contraction within our service territories, which could reduce energy demand.\nDecreased use of our generation, transmission, and distribution services might result in stranded costs, which ultimately might not be recovered through rates, and therefore, could lead to an impairment of assets.\nFINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS\nAmeren\u2019s holding company structure could limit its ability to pay common stock dividends and to service its debt obligations.\nAmeren is a holding company; therefore, its primary assets are its investments in the common stock of its subsidiaries, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. As a result, Ameren\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the earnings of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to Ameren. Similarly, Ameren\u2019s ability to service its debt obligations is dependent upon the earnings of its operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings and other payments, including payments of principal and interest under affiliate indebtedness. The payment of dividends to Ameren by its subsidiaries in turn depends on their results of operations, and other items affecting retained earnings, and available cash. Ameren\u2019s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for payments required pursuant to the terms of affiliate borrowing arrangements and cash payments under the tax allocation agreement) to Ameren. Certain financing agreements, corporate organizational documents, and certain statutory and regulatory requirements may impose restrictions on the ability of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI to transfer funds to Ameren in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.\nCosts associated with our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits could increase.\nAmeren has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees and has postretirement benefit plans covering non-union employees hired before October 2015 and union employees hired before January 2020. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, timing of employee retirements, and mortality, as well as other actuarial matters, have a significant impact on our customers\u2019 rates and our plan funding requirements. Ameren\u2019s total pension and postretirement benefit plans were overfunded by $249 million as of December 31, 2020. Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension cost or the legally required minimum contribution. Based on Ameren\u2019s assumptions at December 31, 2020, its investment performance in 2020, and its pension funding policy, Ameren expects to make aggregate contributions of $60 million over the next five years. Ameren Missouri\u2019s and Ameren Illinois\u2019 portions of the future funding requirements are estimated to be 30% and 60%, respectively. These estimates may change with actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions.\nIn addition to the costs of our pension plans, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs of health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. Future legislative changes related to health care could also significantly change our benefit programs and costs. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits could increase our financing needs and otherwise adversely affect our financial position and liquidity.\nGENERAL RISKS\nCustomers\u2019, investors\u2019, legislators\u2019, and regulators\u2019 opinions of us are affected by many factors, including system reliability, implementation of our strategic plan, protection of customer information, rates, media coverage, and environmental, social, and governance practices, as well as actions by other utility companies. Negative opinions developed by customers, investors, legislators, or regulators could harm our reputation.\nService interruptions and facility shutdowns can occur due to failures of equipment as a result of severe or destructive weather or other causes. The ability of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to respond promptly to such failures can affect customer satisfaction. In addition to system reliability issues, the success of modernization efforts, our ability to safeguard sensitive customer information and protect our systems from cyber attacks, and other actions can affect customer satisfaction. The level of rates, the timing and magnitude of rate increases, and the volatility of rates can also affect customer satisfaction.\nOur ability to successfully execute our strategic plan, including the transition of Ameren Missouri\u2019s generation fleet and achievement of the carbon emission reduction targets outlined in the 2020 IRP, may affect customers\u2019, investors\u2019, legislators\u2019, and regulators\u2019 opinions and actions. Additionally, negative perceptions or publicity resulting from increasing scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance practices could negatively impact our reputation, investment in our common stock, or our access to capital markets. Customers\u2019, investors\u2019, legislators\u2019, and regulators\u2019 opinions of us can also be affected by media coverage, including social media, which may include information, whether factual or not, that damages our brand and reputation.\nIf customers, investors, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us and our utility services, this could result in increased costs associated with regulatory oversight and could affect the ROEs we are allowed to earn, as well as the access to, and the cost of, capital. Additionally, negative opinions about us or other utility companies could make it more difficult for our businesses to achieve\nfavorable legislative or regulatory outcomes. Negative opinions could also result in sales volume reductions or increased use of distributed generation by our customers. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nWe are subject to employee work force factors that could adversely affect our operations.\nOur businesses depend upon our ability to employ and retain key officers and other skilled professional and technical employees. Certain specialized knowledge that focuses on skilled-craft and STEM-related disciplines is required to construct and operate generation, transmission, and distribution assets. Further, a significant portion of our work force is nearing retirement. We are also party to collective bargaining agreements that collectively represent about 48% of Ameren\u2019s total employees. Certain events, such as an aging workforce without adequately trained replacement employees, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or any work stoppage experienced in connection with negotiations of collective bargaining agreements, could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are subject to acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, and other intentionally disruptive acts.\nLike other electric and natural gas utilities, our energy centers, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities, and information systems may be affected by terrorist activities and other intentionally disruptive acts, including cyber attacks, which could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute our energy products. There have been attacks on energy infrastructure, such as substations and related assets, in the past, and there may be more attacks in the future as technology becomes more prevalent in energy infrastructure. Any such incident could limit our ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power or natural gas and could have significant regional economic consequences. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues, a significant increase in costs including those for repair, or adversely affect economic activity in our service territory which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nThere has been an increase in the number and sophistication of cyber attacks across all industries worldwide. Cyber attacks could include viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other ransom-based attacks, improper access by third parties, attacks on email systems, and ransom demands to not expose sensitive data, operational control, or security vulnerabilities specific to our systems, among various other security breaches. A security breach at our physical assets or in our information systems could affect the reliability of the transmission and distribution system, disrupt electric generation, including nuclear generation, and/or subject us to financial harm resulting from theft or the inappropriate release or destruction of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, employee, financial, and operating system information. Many of our suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support our operations and maintain customer and employee data. A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect our business as if it was a breach of our own system. If a significant breach occurred, our reputation could be adversely affected, customer confidence could be diminished, and/or we could be subject to increased costs associated with regulatory oversight, fines or legal claims, any of which could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant costs for remedying the impacts of such a breach. Our generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, RTO, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect our businesses. Insurance might not be adequate to cover losses that arise in connection with these events. In addition, new regulations could require changes in our security measures and result in increased costs. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nOur businesses are dependent on our ability to access the capital markets successfully. We might not have access to sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed, as well as on reasonable terms.\nWe rely on the issuance of short-term and long-term debt and equity as significant sources of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flow, as well as to refinance existing long-term debt. The inability to raise debt or equity capital on reasonable terms, or at all, could negatively affect our ability to maintain or to expand our businesses. Events beyond our control, such as depressed economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic, or extreme volatility in the debt, equity, or credit markets, might create uncertainty that could increase our cost of capital or impair or eliminate our ability to access the debt, equity, or credit markets, including our ability to draw on bank credit facilities. Any adverse change in our credit ratings could reduce access to capital and trigger collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes could also increase the cost of borrowing and the costs of fuel, power, and natural gas supply, among other things, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.", "PERMNO": 24985, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "AEE"}
