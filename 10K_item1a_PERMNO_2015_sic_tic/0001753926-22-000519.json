{"cik": "225211", "company": "Touchpoint Group Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe have a history of operating losses and our auditors have indicated that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we reported losses from operations of approximately $4.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and negative cash flow from operations of $2.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate accumulated deficit of approximately $70.1 million. Such losses have required us to seek additional funding through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nAs a result of these net losses and cash flow deficits and other factors, our independent auditors issued an audit opinion with respect to our consolidated financial statements for the two years ended December 31, 2021 that indicated that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These adjustments would likely include substantial impairment of the carrying amount of our assets and potential contingent liabilities that may arise if we are unable to fulfill various operational commitments. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flow from operations and obtaining additional capital and financing, including any funds to be raised in the future. If our ability to generate cash flow from operations is delayed or reduced and we are unable to raise additional funding from other sources, we may be unable to continue in business even if other fundraising is successful. For further discussion about our ability to continue as a going concern and our plan for future liquidity, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d\nWe may require additional funding for our growth plans and such funding may result in a dilution of your investment.\nWe have estimated our funding requirements necessary to implement our growth plans, including the revitalization of the WCAR. If the costs of implementing such plans should exceed these estimates significantly or if we come across opportunities to grow through expansion which cannot be predicted at this time, and our funds generated from our operations prove insufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds to meet these funding requirements.\nThese additional funds may be raised by issuing equity or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we will not be able to implement such plans fully if at all. Such financing even if obtained, may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders\u2019 consent for payment of dividends, or restrict our freedom to operate our business by requiring lender\u2019s consent for certain corporate actions.\nFurther, if we raise additional funds by way of a rights offering or through the issuance of new shares, any shareholders who are unable or unwilling to participate in such an additional round of fund raising may suffer dilution in their investment.\nNo Assurance the WCAR can be successfully revitalized.\nWe only recently began to seek to revitalize the World Championship Air Race Series. There is no assurance we will be successful in our efforts to hold any races or generate positive cash flow from any races held. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to promote the WCAR and cannot generate positive cash flow therefrom, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNot operated for profit.\nWe believe the WCAR was staged by Red Bull for promotional purposes and not with a view to generating a profit. We are not aware of any previous air race series that has successfully operated profitably for an extended period of time and there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. If we cannot operate the WCAR profitably, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nWe need capital to organize and stage the WCAR\nWe currently lack the capital necessary to stage an air race. We are seeking to obtain commitments and advance payments from potential host cities and other sponsors. There is no assurance we will be successful in our efforts to raise the capital necessary to stage a series or even one air race or that host cities or sponsors will make sufficient payments for us to organize and stage an air race. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise capital or obtain advance payments sufficient to fund an air race, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even f we succeed in obtaining sufficient funds to stage an air race, there is no assurance we will generate positive cash flow from the staging of an air race or series of air races and the failure to do so it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur current management has no experience in promoting an air race.\nOur current management has no experience in the promotion of an event such as the WCAR. Consequently, we have recruited former members of the team which staged the WCAR for Red Bull to assist us. There is no assurance we will be able to retain the services of these individuals or that they will be able to hire any additional personnel necessary to successfully promote the WCAR. Any failure to attract new or retain these key individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe WCAR has not been staged since the 2019 season.\nRed Bull held its last air race in 2019. This gap in the presentation of air races may have caused fans to lose interest and switch to other forms of entertainment events and may have caused cities and sponsors to turn to other ways of promoting themselves. There can be no assurance that any race we may stage will be viewed by as many fans as watched the WCAR when it was promoted by Red Bull.\nAir racing is a highly regulated activity.\nIn order to stage an air race we need to obtain the right for the planes and other vehicles to fly in designated air space. There is no assurance that we can obtain the rights to the air space necessary to hold air races. If we are not able to obtain the air rights in the location of a city which is willing to host an event, we will be unable to stage air races which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAir racing is extremely dangerous.\nBy its nature, air racing is extremely dangerous. Although all pilots and race crews are highly trained, there can be no assurance an accident will not occur injuring participants and spectators. There is no assurance we can obtain insurance sufficient to pay any claims or awards that would result from an accident or, that if obtained, the terms of such insurance would be favorable to us.\nAn air race could be the object of a terrorist attack.\nBy its nature an air race is a highly visible public event intended to attract a large crowd of spectators. Some of the cities which we will approach to host an air race are located in the Middle East and other areas prone to terrorist attacks. If one of our events was to become the target of a terrorist attack or if host cities or the public were to believe that one of our events will be the subject of a terrorist attack, it could have an adverse impact on the willingness of a city to host an event or the public to attend any race we stage. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a trading company and depend upon our business for our operating cash flows.\nAll of our operations are conducted, and almost all of our assets are owned, by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flows and our ability to meet our obligations depend upon the cash flows of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by these subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, distributions or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities and legal restrictions. Any failure to receive dividends or distributions from our subsidiaries when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe have made a number of unsuccessful acquisitions. Future acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business and harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe have made a number of acquisitions of smaller companies we intended to grow and operate profitably. We were not successful in these efforts.\nWe may in the future explore potential acquisitions of companies or strategic investments to strengthen our business. Even if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms or financing of the acquisition, and our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf straining our financial resources;\n\u25cf anticipated benefits may not materialize as rapidly as we expect, or at all;\n\u25cf diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to address acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u25cf cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u25cf integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u25cf litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, former stockholders or other third parties.\nFailure to appropriately mitigate these risks or other issues related to strategic investments and acquisitions could result in reducing or completely eliminating any anticipated benefits of transactions, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by economic developments in the digital media, sports and entertainment industries and/or the economy in general.\nThe competition for viewers at sporting events such as our Air Race is extremely intense and our business of supplying a robust fan engagement platform designed to enhance the fan experience and drive commercial aspects of the sports and entertainment business, is highly competitive. We are therefore susceptible to not only the economics of the sports and entertainment business, but also the economy in general. Any significant downturn in the market or in general economic conditions would likely negatively affect our business and your investment in our common stock.\nFuture growth and development of operations will depend on acceptance of our Touchpoint platform and apps. If our fan engagement platform is not deemed desirable, and we cannot establish a viable customer base, we may not be able to generate future revenues. This would result in a failure of our business and a loss of any investment one makes in our shares.\nThe acceptance of our fan engagement platform is critically important to our success. We cannot be certain that it will be appealing to prospective customers and their fans, and, as a result, there may not be a demand for our platform.\nDemand for our fan engagement platform depends on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the number of customers we can attract and retain over time;\n\u25cf the economy in general and, in periods of rapidly declining economic conditions, customers may defer services, such as ours, to pay their own debts to remain solvent;\n\u25cf the competitive environment in the digital media, sports and entertainment markets may force us to reduce prices below desired pricing level or increase promotional spending;\n\u25cf the ability to anticipate changes in user preferences and to meet customers\u2019 needs in a timely, cost-effective manner.\nAll these factors could result in immediate and longer-term declines in demand for our offered services through our fan engagement platform, which could adversely affect our sales, cash flows and overall financial condition. As a result, an investor could lose his or her entire investment.\nCompetition in markets in which we operate is extensive and varied and our competitors are mostly larger and more established than we are.\nOur business and the industry in which we operate are subject to extreme competition. There can be no guarantee that we can develop or sustain a market position or expand our business to successfully compete with other larger and more established companies. We anticipate the intensity of competition will increase.\nWe compete with many entities providing similar services to prospective customers. Such competitors include large nationwide businesses engaged in providing fan platforms, including but not limited to companies that have established loyal customer bases over several decades and have the same or a similar business plan as we do, and may be looking to expand nationwide; and a variety of other local and national software development companies with which we either currently or may, in the future, compete.\nMany current and potential competitors are well established, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, operational resources and name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may have more credibility with both existing and potential customers, be able to offer more services, and more aggressively promote and sell their services. Our competitors may be able to support more aggressive pricing than us, which could adversely affect sales, cause us to decrease prices to remain competitive, or otherwise reduce the overall gross profit earned on our services.\nCompetition among sporting events for viewers and sponsors is extremely intense. There are numerous events with worldwide appeal that are more established and financially stable than the WCAR.\nThere are numerous sporting events held regularly throughout the world in various disciplines with established sponsor relationships and fan bases. Competition for sponsors for the WCAR and viewership is fierce. There can be no guarantee that we can develop or sustain relationships with sponsors or a significant fan base or expand our business to successfully compete with other larger and more established events. We anticipate the intensity of competition will increase.\nChanges in user preferences and discretionary spending may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our services and our ability to develop our services and products in a way that appeals to users. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, on discretionary user spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience an inability to generate revenue during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty, where users decide to acquire less expensive services or products, or to forego expenditures due to a lack of available capital. Any material decline in discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe sports and entertainment business is extremely competitive and commercial success of any service is often dependent on factors beyond our control, including to market acceptance and quality of our services. Our quarterly results of operations have in the past, and may in the future, fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including limited visibility of the timing and certainty of future services and projects. In future periods, our revenue or profitability could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations do not meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. In addition to the other risk factors set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenues or results of operations include:\n\u25cf our ability to increase keep existing clients and attract new clients;\n\u25cf our failure to accurately estimate or control costs;\n\u25cf the loss of significant clients;\n\u25cf maintaining appropriate staffing levels and capabilities relative to projected growth;\n\u25cf adverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes; and\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions and those conditions specific to companies such as us.\nWe believe that our quarterly revenues and results of operations on a year-over-year and sequential quarter-over-quarter basis may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of prior quarters as an indication of future performance.\nIf our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, this could negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAt any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. Unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. If our clients experience financial difficulties, they may be unable to pay us in accordance with our agreements, or may seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms. This could result in reduced revenues as well as write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if such difficulties were severe, reduced liquidity. Accordingly, if our clients experience financial distress, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur executive officers do not reside in the United States.\nOur U.S. stockholders would face difficulty in:\n\u25cf Effecting service of process within the United States on our executive officers, if considered necessary.\n\u25cf Enforcing judgments against the executive officers obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.\n\u25cf Bringing an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities based on the U.S. federal securities laws against the executive officers.\nAccordingly, persons contemplating an investment in our common stock should seriously consider these factors before making an investment decision.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees and our ability to attract, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled and creative employees in the future.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, and in particular Mark White, our Chief Executive Officer, and Martin Ward, our Chief Financial Officer. We rely on the leadership, knowledge and experience that our executive officers and key employees provide. They foster our corporate culture, which we believe has been instrumental to our ability to attract and retain new talent. Any failure to attract new or retain key creative talent could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur executive officers have no experience in staging and promoting an air race. Our ability to present an air race depends on the efforts of personnel we only recently engaged. The market for talent in air racing and media is intensely competitive, which could increase our costs to attract and retain talented employees. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain employees, including significant expenditures related to salaries and benefits and compensation expenses related to equity awards, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them.\nEmployee turnover, including changes in our management team and the individuals engaged to present the WCAR, could disrupt our business. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees, or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled and creative employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance coverage and an interruption of our business or loss of a significant amount of property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe currently do not maintain any insurance policies against loss of key personnel and business interruption as well as product liability claims. If such events were to occur, our business, financial performance and financial position may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could become involved in claims or litigations that may result in adverse outcomes.\nFrom time-to-time we may be involved in a variety of claims or litigations. Such proceedings may initially be viewed as immaterial but, could prove to be material. Litigations are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. Given the inherent uncertainties in litigation, even when we can reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and reasonably estimable loss contingencies, the actual outcome may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach. In addition, such claims or litigations could involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to protect our intellectual property.\nWe generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, freelancers and vendors to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property or that of our clients. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our or our clients\u2019 intellectual property without authorization. Policing unauthorized use is difficult. The steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of intellectual property and our confidentiality agreements may not be enforceable. In addition, we may be required to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. In the event we are unable to prevent or are required to defend misappropriations of intellectual property, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThere is no intellectual property which acts as a barrier to entry to holding an air race.\nWe do not hold any intellectual property rights or established relationships which could be used to prevent or hinder another party from staging an air race or a series of air races. If another party were to seek to stage a competitive race series, even if failed in such effort, it could have a disruptive impact on our attempt to conduct the WCAR and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately safeguard our intellectual property or we may face claims that may be costly to resolve or that limit our ability to use such intellectual property in the future.\nOur business is reliant on our intellectual property. Our software, which we believe to be proprietary and unique, is the result of our research and development efforts. However, we are unable to assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in respect of our intellectual property or that such claims will not be successful. It may be difficult for us to establish or protect our intellectual property against such third parties and we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending any claims relating to proprietary rights. If any party succeeds in asserting a claim against us relating to the disputed intellectual property, we may need to obtain licenses to continue to use the same. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could cause our business results to suffer.\nWhere litigation is necessary to safeguard our intellectual property, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, this could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or future prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services in connection with our business, and any failure by these third parties to perform their obligations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties that include, but are not limited to, information technology systems (including hosting our website, mobile application and our point of sale system), software development and support, select marketing services, employee benefits servicing and video production and distribution. Services provided by third-party suppliers could be interrupted as a result of many factors. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with the third parties\u2019 abilities to provide these services to meet our needs. Any failure by a third party to provide services for which we have contracted on a timely basis or within expected service level and performance standards could result in a disruption of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that our TP platform may infringe on other patented, trademarked or copyrighted concepts. Litigation arising out of infringement or other commercial disputes could cause us to incur expenses and impair our competitive advantage.\nWe cannot be certain that our products or services will not infringe upon patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. Because we may rely on third parties to help develop some of our products and services, we cannot ensure that litigation will not arise from disputes involving these third parties. We may incur substantial expenses in defending against prospective claims, regardless of their merit. Successful claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability, significantly impact our results of operations in one or more quarters, or materially disrupt the conduct of our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property protection for our products and services, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, as previously stated.\nThe validity and breadth of claims covered in our copyrights and trademarks that we intend to file involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. No assurances can be given that any future copyright, trademark or other applications:\n(i) will be issued;\n(ii) that the scope of any future intellectual property protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to the company;\n(iii) that any copyrights or trademarks will be held valid if subsequently challenged;\n(iv) that others will not claim rights in, or ownership of, the potential copyrights or trademarks or other proprietary rights held by us; or\n(v) that our intellectual property will not infringe, or be alleged to infringe, the proprietary rights of others.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that others have not developed or will not develop similar products and services. Also, whether or not additional intellectual property protection is issued to the company, others may hold or receive intellectual protection covering projects that were subsequently developed by the company. No assurance can be given that others will not or have not independently developed or otherwise acquired substantially equivalent intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other media companies with which we compete. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe depend on advanced technologies and computer systems and we cannot predict the effect that rapid technological change or alternative forms of entertainment may have on us or our industry.\nOur industry continues to undergo significant changes as a result of technological developments. The rapid growth of technology and shifting consumer tastes prevent us from being able to accurately predict the overall effect that technological growth or the availability of alternative forms of advertising and fan engagement may have on the potential revenues from, and profitability of, our products and services. To enhance our technologies, we are required to purchase third-party licenses, which can result in significant expenditures. In some cases, the licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. At the time we purchase licenses, we do not know if the related technology will enhance our revenues. Furthermore, the licensed software could have errors or defects which could result in significantly increased costs. Such delays could have an adverse effect on our brand name and our relationship with our clients, which, given our reliance on our core strategic client relationships, could result in a decrease in our revenues. As a result, in the event that we do not keep pace with technological advancements, or our technologies do not meet our expectations, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks.\nWe rely heavily on information technologies and infrastructure to manage and conduct our business. This includes the production and digital storage of content and client information and the development of new business opportunities. The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, ransomware, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software and other malicious activities could have a negative impact on our business and productivity. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. We have taken preventative steps and seek to follow industry best practices, including the use of firewalls, deployment of antivirus software and regular patch maintenance updates; however no system is completely immune from these types of attacks. If we become subject to cyber breach, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nPower outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather) or terrorist activities can impact an entire system. We have designed our systems to provide replication across our United Kingdom, United States and Hong Kong locations, including data and toolsets designed to allow most or all work-related activities to continue if there is a disruption at one location. However, in the event of such a disruption, our ability to operate nonetheless may be adversely affected. Human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of client and personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. We also utilize third parties to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. Any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients\u2019 or vendors\u2019 proprietary information and damage our reputation. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or other individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable. Efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We take precautions to limit access to sensitive information to only those individuals requiring it. Any significant distribution in our equipment or loss or improper disclosure of data could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCyberattacks and security breaches of our platform, or those impacting our customers or third parties, could adversely impact our brand and reputation and our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of confidential information, customer and other personal data. We have built our reputation on the premise that our platform offers our customers a secure way to interact with their fan base. As a result, any actual or perceived security breach of us or our third-party partners may:\n\u25cf harm our reputation and brand;\n\u25cf result in our systems or services being unavailable and interrupt the operations of our customers;\n\u25cf result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws;\n\u25cf result in significant regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, penalties, and other legal, regulatory, and financial exposure;\n\u25cf cause us to incur significant remediation costs;\n\u25cf lead to theft or irretrievable loss of monies being transmitted to our customers;\n\u25cf reduce customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services;\n\u25cf divert the attention of management from the operation of our business;\n\u25cf result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers or third parties as a result of losses to them or claims by them; and\n\u25cf adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFurther, any actual or perceived breach or cybersecurity attack directed at others, whether or not we are directly impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in doing business online or in the use of technology to conduct transactions, which could negatively impact us.\nAn increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies, and financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.\nAttacks upon systems across a variety of industries are increasing in their frequency, persistence, and sophistication, and, in many cases, are being conducted by sophisticated, well-funded, and organized groups and individuals, including state actors. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to systems and information (including customers\u2019 personal data), disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. These attacks may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers or customers. Certain types of cyberattacks could harm us even if our systems are left undisturbed. For example, attacks may be designed to deceive employees and service providers into releasing control of our systems to a hacker, while others may aim to introduce computer viruses or malware into our systems with a view to stealing confidential or proprietary data. Additionally, certain threats are designed to remain dormant or undetectable until launched against a target and we may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures.\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage for our customers, prevent data loss and other security breaches, effectively respond to known and potential risks, there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security or prevent breaches or attacks. Certain threat actors may be supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Further, there has been an increase in such activities as a result of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic. As a result, our costs and the resources we devote to protecting against these advanced threats and their consequences may continue to increase over time.\nOur networks and systems may require significant expansion to accommodate new processing and storage requirements.\nWe may experience limitations relating to the capacity of our networks, systems and processes. In the future, we may need to expand our network and systems if our networks and systems cannot accommodate new processing and storage requirements due to growth in our business. Our network or systems may not be capable of meeting the demand for increased capacity, or we may incur additional unanticipated expenses to accommodate these capacity demands. In addition, we may lose valuable data, or our network may temporarily shut down if we fail to adequately expand or maintain our network capabilities to meet future requirements. Any lapse in our ability to store or transmit data or any disruption in our network processing may damage our reputation and result in the loss of clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to attract or retain qualified information technology staff may impair our ability to effectively compete.\nDue to the nature of our business, we have significantly more complex technology requirements than most typical enterprises of a comparable size. We find ourselves competing for top information technology and software development talent against much larger technology companies that can offer significant career advantages, or technology startups that can offer significant compensation incentives. If we become unable to acquire or retain qualified information technology staff, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to an extensive and highly-evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur business and the businesses of our customers conducted using our platform and technology, are subject to extensive laws, rules, regulations, policies, orders, determinations, directives, treaties, and legal and regulatory interpretations and guidance in the markets in which we operate, including those governing privacy, data governance, data protection, cybersecurity, fraud detection, payment services, consumer protection and tax. Many of these legal and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, digital assets, and related technologies. As a result, they are subject to significant uncertainty, and vary widely across U.S. federal, state, and local and international jurisdictions. These legal and regulatory regimes, including the laws, rules, and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. To the extent we have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on our products and services, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to existing laws and regulations, various governmental and regulatory bodies, including legislative and executive bodies, in the United States and in other countries may adopt new laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may be issued by such bodies or the judiciary, which may change how we operate our business, how our products and services and those of our customers are regulated, and what products or services we and our competitors can offer, requiring changes to our compliance and risk mitigation measures\nAs we expand our international activities, our obligations to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, and policies of a variety of jurisdictions will increase.\nAs we expand internationally, we will become obligated to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations of the jurisdictions in which we operate and those into which we offer services on a cross-border basis. Laws regulating the internet, mobile technologies, and related technologies outside of the United States often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability.\nDue to the uncertain application of existing laws and regulations, it may be that, despite our regulatory and legal analysis concluding that certain products and services are currently unregulated, such products or services may indeed be subject to licensing, or authorization obligations that we have not obtained or with which we have not complied. The failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to penalties which could significantly and adversely affect our continued operations and financial condition.\nAny significant disruption in our products and services, in our information technology systems, or in any of the blockchain networks of third parties relied upon by our customers to authenticate and identify collectables, could result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our brand and reputation and our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and grow our business depends on our ability to operate our service at high levels of reliability, scalability, and performance. The use of certain features of our TP platform requires access to the blockchain networks maintained by third parties to identify and authenticate digital assets such as the collectables to be sold by our customers, which access is dependent on our systems\u2019 ability to access the internet. Further, the successful and continued operations of such blockchain networks will depend on a network of computers, miners, or validators, and their continued operations, all of which may be impacted by service interruptions.\nOur systems, the systems of our third-party service providers and blockchain networks have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, break-ins, sabotage, human error, vandalism, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. In addition, extraordinary site usage could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Some of our systems and the systems of our third-party service providers are not fully redundant, and our or their disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events.\nIf any of our systems, or those of our third-party service providers, are disrupted for any reason, our products and services may fail, resulting in unanticipated disruptions, incomplete or inaccurate recording or processing of sales, loss of customer information, increased demand on limited customer support resources, customer claims, complaints with regulatory organizations or lawsuits. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers, these customers could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws with respect to our activities outside the United States.\nWe distribute our products to locations within and outside the United States as well as operate our business within and outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPublic health epidemics or outbreaks, such as COVID-19, could materially and adversely impact our business.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread throughout the world.\nMany countries, provincial, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19 and many individuals and businesses have voluntarily limited their activities. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, we have seen delays in commencement of operations by licensees of the Touchpoint App and platform which leads to subsequent delays in subscriptions being processed. All of our employees and management can operate from home whilst the stay-at-home orders remain in place.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe measures taken to date will impact the Company\u2019s business for the fiscal first, second and third quarters of 2021 and potentially beyond. The significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company\u2019s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR STATUS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY.\nAs a public company, we are subject to additional reporting and corporate governance requirements that will require additional management time, resources and expense.\nAs a public company we are obligated to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the Exchange Act. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, all of which impose significant compliance and reporting obligations upon us and require us to incur additional expense in order to fulfill such obligations.\nTrading on the OTC Markets is volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our security holders to resell their common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. Trading in securities quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors, some of which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like Nasdaq Capital Market or a stock exchange like the NYSE American. These factors may result in investors having difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock.\nOur stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile in the future. You may not be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market\u2019s adverse reaction to volatility.\nOther factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf the absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us;\n\u25cf we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held;\n\u25cf overall stock market fluctuations;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the industry;\n\u25cf litigation;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n\u25cf future sales of common stock;\n\u25cf departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and\n\u25cf general market conditions.\nAny of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock and/or warrants. In addition, the stock market in general has at times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and/or warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules. It may be more difficult to resell securities classified as \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price below $5.00). These rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as \u201cestablished customers\u201d or \u201caccredited investors.\u201d For example, broker-dealers must determine the appropriateness for non-qualifying persons of investments in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must also provide, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, disclose the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, furnish monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account, provide a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction.\nLegal remedies available to an investor in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d may include the following:\n\u25cf If a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above, or other federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel the purchase and receive a refund of the investment.\n\u25cf If a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that committed the fraud for damages.\nThese requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that is subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nMany brokerage firms discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks. Most institutional investors will not invest in penny stocks. In addition, many individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due, among other reasons, to the increased financial risk generally associated with these investments.\nFor these reasons, penny stocks may have a limited market and, consequently, limited liquidity. We can give no assurance at what time, if ever, our common stock will no longer be classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d in the future.\nAs a result of our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the price of our securities may be adversely affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting has weaknesses and conditions that require correction or remediation, the disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and if we fail to continue to comply, our business could be harmed and the price of our securities could decline.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require an annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and for certain issuers an attestation of this assessment by the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our securities will be affected; however, we believe that there is a risk that investor confidence and the market value of our securities may be negatively affected.\nCertain provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may have anti-takeover effects, which may make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws may delay or prevent a takeover which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our bylaws, as amended, may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt. Further, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors in their sole discretion. Our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their common stock, and stockholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms. We cannot assure you of a positive return on investment or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock.\nThe issuance of a large number of shares of our common stock could significantly dilute existing stockholders and negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOn March 16, 2021, we entered into a Standby Equity Commitment Agreement (\u201cSECA\u201d), with MacRab, LLC (\u201cMacRab\u201d) providing that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, MacRab is committed to purchase, on an unconditional basis, shares of our common stock (\u201cPut Shares\u201d) at an aggregate price of up to $5,000,000 over the course of its term. Pursuant to the SECA, the purchase price for each of the Put Shares equals 90% of the lesser of the (i) \u201cMarket Price,\u201d which is defined as the average of the two lowest volume weighted average the Valuation Period. The Valuation Period is the 8 trading days immediately following the date MacRab receives the Put Shares in its brokerage account,. As a result, if we sell shares of common stock under the Equity Purchase Agreement, we will be issuing common stock at below market prices, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and if such issuances are significant in number, the amount of the decline in our market price could also be significant. In general, we are unlikely to sell shares of common stock under the Equity Purchase Agreement at a time when the additional dilution to stockholders would be substantial unless we are unable to obtain capital to meet our financial obligations from other sources on better terms at such time. However, if we do, the dilution that could result from such issuances could have a material adverse impact on existing stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to fall rapidly based on the amount of such dilution. Under the SECA MacRab received 2,272,727 stock purchase warrants with an exercise price of $0.044 upon the signing of the agreement. MacRab retains the rights to the warrants if the agreement is ever terminated.\nMacRab may sell a large number of shares, resulting in substantial diminution to the value of shares held by existing stockholders.\nPursuant to the SECA, we are prohibited from delivering a Put Notice to MacRab if the purchase shares would cause MacRab to beneficially own more than 4.99% of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. These restrictions, however, do not prevent MacRab from selling shares of common stock received in connection with the $5,000,000 MacRab equity line (the \u201cEquity Line\u201d), including shares purchased pursuant to the warrants granted to MacRab, and then receiving additional shares of common stock in connection with a subsequent issuance. In this way, MacRab could sell more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock in a relatively short time frame while never holding more than 4.99% at any one time. As a result, existing stockholders and new investors could experience substantial diminution in the value of their shares of common stock. Additionally, we do not have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales by MacRab of the shares issued under the Equity Line.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders and the holders of outstanding convertible notes and warrants, may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock and shares which may be obtained upon the exercise or conversion of such warrants or notes, by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months, subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months, subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information, and notice requirements. Given the limited trading of our common stock, resale of even a small number of shares of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective registration statement may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 27204, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "TGHI"}
