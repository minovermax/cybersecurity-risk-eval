{"cik": "47307", "company": "CRAWFORD UNITED Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may experience substantial increases and decreases in business volume throughout economic cycles. Industries we serve, including the heavy-duty truck, industrial equipment, aircraft, health care, education, pharmaceutical, industrial manufacturing, agricultural, and petrochemical industries are sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax and monetary policies, public health crises, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy may adversely affect us and our distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:\n\u25cf\nreducing demand for our products, limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;\n\u25cf\nincreasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\n\u25cf\nincreasing price competition in our served markets;\n\u25cf\nsupply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products;\n\u25cf\nincreasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations; and\n\u25cf\nadversely impacting market sizes and growth rates.\nIf growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nSignificant developments or uncertainties stemming from U.S. laws and policies, including changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges, potential changes or uncertainties in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, could adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, the U.S. administration has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States, raising the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases and substantial changes to trade agreements. These factors have adversely affected, and in the future could further adversely affect, our business and results of operations. Furthermore, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that we or our customers and suppliers export or import could affect demand for our products. Direct or indirect consequences of tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions may also alter the competitive landscape of our products in one or more regions of the world. Trade tensions or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDecreased availability or increased costs of materials could increase our costs of producing our products.\nWe purchase raw materials, fabricated components, some finished goods and services from a variety of suppliers. Where appropriate, we employ contracts with our suppliers, both domestic and international. From time to time, however, the prices, availability, or quality of these materials fluctuate due to global market demands, import duties and tariffs, economic conditions, or other conditions such as public health crises, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials or increase the cost of these materials. For example, in December 2019 and January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has resulted in travel disruption and an impact on corporate operations in China. At this point, the exact extent to which the Coronavirus may impact our supply chain or results of operations is uncertain; however, our operational results may suffer and our revenues may be impacted in 2020 as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak. Further, inflationary and other increases in costs of materials have occurred in the past and may recur from time to time. In addition, freight costs associated with shipping products and receiving materials are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas. A reduction in the supply or increase in the cost or change in quality of those materials could impact our ability to manufacture our products and could increase the cost of production, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nOur growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.\nOur growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial results. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience seasonality or other periodic, cyclical downturns. Demand for our products is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, marketing, new product introductions, changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.\nWe are engaged in highly competitive industries and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share.\nOur businesses operate in industries that are highly competitive. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products to maintain and expand our brand recognition and position in various product categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial results.\nAdverse credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to access credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit to us in the future. These market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to grow and maintain our business. Accordingly, we may be forced to delay raising capital or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures or other discretionary uses of cash. Overall, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets.\nOur revolving credit facility contains various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business, including requiring us to maintain a maximum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOur revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants and restrictions, including financial covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt;\n\u25cf\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u25cf\nmake investments, including capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nsell or acquire assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u25cf\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf\nmake fundamental business changes.\nThe revolving credit facility also requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.00. If we fail to comply with the restrictions in the revolving credit facility or any other current or future financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors under the relevant agreements to accelerate the related debts and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which typically will include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the creditors may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt, and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds. The exercise of any default remedies by our creditors would have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures.\nWe are dependent on key customers.\nWe rely on several key customers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53% of our net sales. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of our net sales. Due to competitive issues, we have lost key customers in the past and may again in the future. Customer orders are dependent upon their markets and may be subject to delays or cancellations. As a result of dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if any of the following were to occur:\n\u25cf\nthe loss of any key customer, in whole or in part;\n\u25cf\nthe insolvency or bankruptcy of any key customer;\n\u25cf\na declining market in which customers reduce orders or demand reduced prices; or\n\u25cf\na strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility, which could affect both their suppliers and customers.\nIf any of our key customers become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover accounts receivable from that customer would be adversely affected and any payments we received in the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially forfeitable, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy we acquire businesses. Acquisitions involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial results:\n\u25cf\nany business that we acquire could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, or we could fail to operate any such business profitably;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community\u2019s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term;\n\u25cf\npre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address;\n\u25cf\nwe could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition; or\n\u25cf\nwe may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated or internal control deficiencies from the acquired company\u2019s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses or adversely affect our financial position.\nFuture claims, litigation and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business.\nWhile we strive to ensure that our products comply with applicable government regulatory standards and internal requirements and that our products perform effectively and safely, customers from time to time could claim that our products do not meet contractual requirements, and users could be harmed by use or misuse of our products. This could give rise to breach of contract, warranty or recall claims, or claims for negligence, product liability, strict liability, personal injury or property damage. Product liability insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances. In addition, claims may arise related to patent infringement, environmental liabilities, distributor terminations, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law, employment law and employee benefits issues and other regulatory matters. While we have in place processes and policies to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we cannot predict the underlying costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nOur business operations could be significantly disrupted by the loss of any members of our senior management team and segment leaders.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and segment leaders. Our senior management team has extensive marketing, sales, manufacturing, finance and engineering experience, and we believe that the depth of our management team is instrumental to our continued success. The loss of any of our key managers in the future could significantly impede our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, financial plans, expansion of services, marketing and other objectives.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or data could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees and customers), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products and fulfilling contractual obligations). These systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, customers or suppliers. Our information technology systems may be exposed to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers\u2019 intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\nThe processing and storage of certain information is increasingly subject to privacy and data security regulations and many such regulations are country-specific. The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), are uncertain, evolving and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Complying with these various laws may be difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. We may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information privacy and security measures, investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and/or comply with regulatory requirements.\nChanges in foreign, cultural, political and financial market conditions could impair the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance.\nThe economies of foreign countries important to the Company\u2019s operations could suffer slower economic growth or economic, social and/or political instability or hyperinflation in the future. The Company\u2019s international operations, including sourcing operations (and the international operations of the Company\u2019s customers), are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect the Company, including, among other things:\n\u25cf\nprotectionist policies restricting or impairing the manufacturing, sales or import and export of the Company\u2019s products, including tariffs and countermeasures;\n\u25cf\nnew restrictions on access to markets;\n\u25cf\nlack of developed infrastructure;\n\u25cf\ninflation (including hyperinflation) or recession;\n\u25cf\ndevaluations or fluctuations in the value of currencies;\n\u25cf\nchanges in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, tax laws, accounting standards, trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements, environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws;\n\u25cf\nsocial, political or economic instability;\n\u25cf\nacts of war and terrorism;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters or other crises;\n\u25cf\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf\nincreases in duties and taxation;\nFurther, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Because of the referendum, the British government began negotiating the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union. While the European Union and United Kingdom reached an agreement on Brexit in October 2019, and the United Kingdom exited the European Union on January 31, 2020, details of the new trade and regulatory relationship are still to be finalized. There may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and European Union countries and increased regulatory complexities in the future. These changes could cause disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services, and people to and from the United Kingdom, disruptions to the workforce or the workforce of the Company\u2019s suppliers or business partners, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and additional legal, political, and economic uncertainty. The foregoing could create uncertainty surrounding the Company\u2019s business and the business of existing and future customers and suppliers, which could increase the cost of some of the Company\u2019s products, thereby reducing its margins. Further, the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company\u2019s small sales volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and local competitors, could exacerbate such risks.\nShould any of these risks occur, the Company\u2019s ability to sell or export its products could be impaired; the Company could experience a loss of sales and profitability from its international operations; and/or the Company could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe elimination of or change in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain floating rate securities and other instruments that we hold.\nLIBOR is a common benchmark interest rate (or reference rate) used to set and make adjustments to interest rates for certain floating rate securities and other financial instruments. Published reports have indicated that regulatory authorities and/or financial institutions may change how LIBOR is calculated or discontinue its calculation and publication after 2021. Alternative reference rates have been developed, including The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), but the acceptance of such alternative rates and their applicability to existing instruments is uncertain. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, outstanding securities with interest rates tied to LIBOR may be adversely affected if those securities either do not provide for the automatic substitution of another reference rate or convert to another reference rate or a fixed rate that could be less favorable to us. Outstanding securities and contracts that could be affected include certain preferred stocks and other floating rate securities, fixed rate securities that may convert to LIBOR-based floating rate instruments in the future, certain derivatives, and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to LIBOR. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could also adversely affect the value of those instruments.\nUnforeseen future events may negatively impact our economic condition.\nFuture events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of our assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, or a material adverse change in our relationship with significant customers.", "PERMNO": 41823, "SIC": 3564, "TIC": "CRAWA"}
