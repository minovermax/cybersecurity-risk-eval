The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe do not have significant operating revenue and we may never have sufficient revenue to be profitable.\nOur ability to achieve significant revenue or profitability depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize existing products, particularly Altrazeal\u00ae. Historically, none of our existing products have had significant sales, and all of our products compete in a competitive marketplace. We may not generate significant revenues or profits from the sale of Altrazeal\u00ae or other products in the future. If we are unable to generate significant revenues over the long term, we will not be profitable and may need to discontinue our operations.\nWe are dependent upon financings to fund our operations and may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nHistorically, we have not generated sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the cash requirements of our operations and other commitments without raising funds through the sale of debt and equity securities. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend, in large part, on our ability to obtain additional financing and generate positive cash flow from operations, neither of which is certain. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized and we may not be able to continue operations. A going concern qualification could impair our ability to finance operations through the sale of debt or equity securities.\nA failure to obtain additional capital when and as needed could jeopardize our operations and the cost of capital may be high.\nIn the event that we need to raise capital in the future, due to our limited revenue and negative working capital, we may be unable to obtain the necessary financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be unable to continue our operations. Even if we are able to raise capital, we may raise capital by selling equity securities, which will be dilutive to existing stockholders. If we incur additional indebtedness, costs of financing may be extremely high, and we will be subject to default risks associated with such indebtedness, which may harm our ability to continue our operations.\nWe have pledged substantially all of our assets as security for indebtedness from Velocitas, and if we default, Velocitas will have all remedies typically available to a secured creditor.\nIn connection with our issuance of $1,000,000 in promissory notes to Velocitas, we signed a security agreement under which we and our subsidiaries have pledged all of our assets as security for the obligations under the notes and security agreement. If we default on any such note or the related security agreement, Velocitas will have available to it all remedies typically available to a secured creditor. This may include foreclosing on and auctioning all of our assets and credit bidding at such auction. Any default under our notes to Velocitas would harm, and likely force us to discontinue, our business.\n- 13 -\nSales of our products are dependent in part upon the efforts of commercial partners and other third parties over which we have no or little control.\nThe right to market and sell our key products in many key markets has been licensed to third parties. This presents certain risks, including the following:\n\u00a7\nour commercial partners and licensees may not place the same priority on sales of our products as we do, may fail to honor contractual commitments, may not have the expertise, financial strength, marketing ability or other characteristics necessary to effectively market our products, may dedicate only limited resources to, and/or may abandon, marketing of a product for reasons, including reasons such as a shift in corporate focus, unrelated to our products' merits;\n\u00a7\nour commercial partners may be in the early stages of development and may not have sufficient liquidity to effectively obtain approvals for and market our products consistent with contractual commitments or our expectations;\n\u00a7\nwe may have disputes with our commercial partners, which may inhibit development, lead to an abandonment of our arrangements, lead to a protracted dispute or have other negative consequences;\n\u00a7\nour commercial partners may fail to honor the terms of our agreements with them, with respect to payment, compliance with law or other terms, which may lead to liquidity issues, reputational harm with end customers and other issues; and\n\u00a7\neven if the commercialization and marketing of products is successful, our revenue share may be limited and may not exceed our associated development and operating costs.\nIf we are unable to establish effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will be unable to successfully commercialize Altrazeal\u00ae and other products.\nIf we are unable to establish the capabilities to sell, market, and distribute Altrazeal\u00ae and other products by entering into agreements with others, or to maintain such capabilities in countries where we have already commenced commercial sales, we will be unable to successfully sell Altrazeal\u00ae and other related products. In that event, we will be unable to generate significant revenues. We may be unable to enter into and maintain any marketing or distribution agreements with third-parties on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third parties on acceptable terms, such agreements may contain terms that are disadvantageous to us and licensees under such agreements may not expend sufficient resources to effectively market our products. In addition, parties to such agreements may fail to perform their obligations under such agreements, which may lead to costly and distracting disputes and periods of uncertainty. We may not be successful in commercializing Altrazeal\u00ae and other products.\nWe may be unable to successfully develop, market, or commercialize our products or our product candidates without establishing new relationships and maintaining current relationships.\nWe do not have the resources to hire a dedicated in-house sales and distribution force for our products. As a result, our strategy for the development and commercialization of our potential products requires us to enter into various arrangements with corporations, collaborators, licensees and others in order to develop, produce and market our products. Our business depends upon our ability to enter into agreements for the development, production, marketing and sale of our products on reasonable terms, which we may be unable to do. Even if we enter into such agreements, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the agreement will not fulfill their obligations under such agreements. Our ability to successfully commercialize and market our products and product candidates will be harmed if our existing relationships are terminated, we are unable to enter into new relationships or our partners fail to fulfill their obligations under the agreements.\n- 14 -\nWe are dependent upon contract manufacturers to safely and timely manufacture our products.\nWe have limited experience in the manufacture of medical devices and pharmaceutical products in commercial quantities. As a result, we have established, and in the future intend to establish, arrangements with contract manufacturers to manufacture, package, label, and deliver our medical devices and pharmaceutical products. Our business will suffer if there are delays or difficulties in establishing relationships with manufacturers to manufacture, package, label, and deliver our products or if the prices charged by such manufacturers are higher than anticipated. Moreover, contract manufacturers that we may use must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices, as required by FDA and other regulatory agencies. If any such manufacturers fail to comply with FDA requirements and similar requirements of other nations, the manufacturers may be unable to manufacture our products. In addition, such manufacturers may fail to manufacture our products in accordance with specifications, or the manufacturing specifications may fail to produce products that comply with functional, technical, cosmetic or other requirements. In addition, third party manufacturers may fail to meet delivery timelines, which may cause problems in our customer or distributor relationships and potentially lead to defaults or an obligation to pay damages. If we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturing on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may harm our ability to generate significant revenues or acceptable profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver such compliant products on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe may incur substantial product liability expenses due to manufacturing or design defects, or the use or misuse of our products.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices and pharmaceutical products. We may face liability to our distributors and customers if our products are not manufactured as per specifications or if such specifications cause the products to spoil, become unsafe or fail to function as marketed. We may also face substantial liability for damages if our products produce adverse side effects or defects are identified with any of our products that harm patients and other users. Any such failures or defects may lead to a breakdown in our relationships with distributors and purchasers, leading to a substantial decline in or collapse of our market. In addition, if any judgments or liabilities are material in size, we may be unable to satisfy such liabilities. Any product liability could harm our operations, and a large judgment could force us to discontinue our operations.\nWe may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with stringent environmental regulations.\nOur development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of such material and certain waste products. If we experience an accident with hazardous materials or otherwise mishandle them, we could be held liable for any damages. Any such liability could exceed our resources and force us to discontinue operations.\nAdditional federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future, including laws related to climate change. We may incur substantial costs to comply with these laws or regulations. Additionally, we may incur substantial fines or penalties if we violate any of these laws or regulations.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our drug or device candidates could substantially depend upon the availability of reimbursement for the costs of the resulting drugs or devices and related treatments.\nThe successful commercialization of, and the interest of potential collaborative partners to invest in the commercialization of our drug or device candidates, may depend substantially upon our completing such processes as necessary to qualify our products for reimbursements and reimbursement prices being at acceptable levels. Our products are not qualified for reimbursement in many of the markets into which we hope to sell. To the extent our products our qualified, the amount of such reimbursement in the United States or elsewhere may be too low or may decrease in the future or may be unavailable for any drugs or devices that we are currently marketing or may develop in the future. Limited reimbursement for the cost of any drugs or devices that we develop will reduce the demand for, or may reduce the price of such drugs or devices, which would hamper our ability to obtain collaborative partners to commercialize our drugs or devices, or to obtain a sufficient financial return on our own manufacture and commercialization of any future drugs or devices.\n- 15 -\nIntense competition may limit our ability to successfully develop and market commercial products.\nThe pharmaceutical and medical device industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological and regulatory change. Our competitors in the United States and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical, device, and chemical companies.\nIn the area of wound management and burn care, which is the primary focus of our commercialization and development activities, a number of companies are developing or evaluating new technology approaches. Significantly larger companies compete in this marketplace including Smith & Nephew plc, Acelity L.P. Inc., ConvaTec Inc., 3M Company, Molnlycke Health Care, and numerous other companies. We expect that technological developments will occur at a rapid rate and that competition is likely to intensify as various alternative technologies achieve similar if not identical or superior advantages.\nIn the area of erodible film technology, any products developed from our OraDisc\u2122 erodible film technology, for the controlled release of pharmaceutical actives, will compete with numerous alternative drug delivery technologies including fast release film technology, transdermal drug delivery, and other mucoadhesive film technologies developed by BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., Church & Dwight, Inc., Johnson & Johnson Consumer Products, Inc., Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, and Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited.\nThese competitors have and employ greater financial and other resources, including larger research and development, marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, our competitors may successfully develop technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that we are developing or which would render our technology and future products obsolete and noncompetitive.\nIn addition, most of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical and clinical trials and may obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals for product candidates more rapidly than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Products resulting from our development efforts or from our joint efforts with collaborative partners therefore may not be commercially competitive with our competitors' existing products or products under development.\nThe market may not accept any medical device or pharmaceutical products that we successfully develop.\nThe drugs and devices that we are attempting to develop may compete with a number of well-established drugs and devices manufactured and marketed by major companies. The degree of market acceptance of any drugs or devices developed by us will depend on a number of factors, including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of our product candidates, the potential advantage of our product candidates over existing therapies and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and those of our partners. Physicians, patients or the medical community in general may not accept or use any drugs or devices that we may develop independently or with our collaborative partners and if they do not, our business could suffer.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges.\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 350-30, Intangibles Other than Goodwill requires that we test goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives for impairment on an annual, or on an interim basis if certain events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value or if the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives falls below their carrying value. In addition, under ASC Topic 350-30, long-lived assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant decrease in the fair value of a long-lived asset, an adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition or an expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated life are among several of the factors that could result in an impairment charge.\n- 16 -\nWe evaluate intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sales or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors such as a decline in our market value below our book value for an extended period of time.\nWe evaluate the estimated lives of all intangible assets on an annual basis, to determine if events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life or the remaining useful life, as applicable, or if a revision in the remaining period of amortization is required. The amount of any such annual or interim impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, we may be subject to legal actions by stockholders, regulators or other parties. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial preparation and presentation.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. Based on this assessment, management believes that during the year ended December 31, 2017 we did not maintain an effective control environment as a result of the lack of segregation of duties. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and lead to disruptions, litigation and liabilities.\nOur business is subject to complex corporate governance, public disclosure, and accounting requirements and regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial results and condition.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations of various federal and state governmental authorities. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), have issued a significant number of complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional requirements and regulations in response to laws enacted by Congress, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and, most recently, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. Our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management's time from other business activities. We also may incur liability if we fail to comply with such laws.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management team, all of which are employed on an at-will basis. In February 2017, Helmut Kerschbaumer, our then Interim President and Chief Executive Officer resigned. Our new Chief Executive Officer, Vaidehi Shah, is not party to an employment agreement and may terminate her employment at any time. Also, she is involved in other businesses or enterprises. The loss of services from Ms. Shah or one or more other members of our senior management or scientific team could delay or prevent the achievement of our development or product commercialization objectives, harm marketing and distribution, harm capital raising and otherwise harm out business. We do not maintain any \"key-man\" insurance policies on any of our senior management and we do not intend to obtain such insurance. In addition, due to the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel. There is intense competition among major pharmaceutical and medical device companies, specialized biotechnology firms and universities and other research institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel.\n- 17 -\nOur Chief Executive Officer is affiliated with Velocitas which may lead to certain risks.\nIn February 2017, our Board of Directors appointed Vaidehi Shah to serve as Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Shah also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Company. She also serves as a managing member of Velocitas Partners, LLC and as managing director of Velocitas GmbH, an entity wholly owned by Velocitas Partners, LLC. Velocitas GmbH is an international medical technology licensing and distribution company and was previously involved in the distribution of Altrazeal\u00ae. Concurrent with the second closing, we appointed other representatives of Velocitas Partners, LLC to the Board of Directors and to executive roles within the Company and also acquired from Velocitas all the Altrazeal\u00ae related distribution agreements. The role of Ms. Shah's and other Velocitas appointees with other business activities may interfere with their decision making as an officer and director of the Company. In addition, Ms. Shah devotes a portion of her time to other business endeavors. As a result, she may not be effective as she would be if she were working only for the Company.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely to a large extent upon information technology systems to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable both to service interruptions and to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions. We may be susceptible to third-party attacks on our information security systems, which attacks are of ever increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Service interruptions or security breaches could result in significant financial, legal, business or reputational harm.\nFluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and our ability to realize projected sales.\nAlthough our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues are realized in Euros. Our revenues are affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro may also affect the reported value of our unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as our cash flows. Currently, we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency risk.\nCertain international markets accounting for a signficiant portion of our current revenues are subject to financial and geopolitical instability.\nIn recent years, our strategy had been to focus on international markets as a result of which certain markets from the Middle East, Europe, and other emerging markets account for a significant portion of our current revenues. Continuing worldwide economic and geopolitical instability could result in slower than expected revenue growth and collection issues\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval\nWe may be unable to obtain government approvals required to market our products and, even if we do, that approval may subsequently be withdrawn or limited.\nGovernment regulation affects the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Government regulations may delay marketing of our potential drugs or potential medical devices for a considerable or indefinite period of time, impose costly procedural requirements upon our activities and furnish a competitive advantage to larger companies or companies more experienced in regulatory affairs. Delays in obtaining governmental regulatory approval could prohibit us from marketing our products in affected markets. Our drug or device candidates may not receive FDA or other regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Even if our drug or device candidates receive marketing approval in the U.S. and other markets, our sales may be harmed by the absence of, or limits on, reimbursement by insurance companies, government health organizations and others in those markets.\n- 18 -\nMoreover, if regulatory approval of a drug or device candidate is granted, such approval may impose limitations on the indicated use for which such drug or device may be marketed. Even if we obtain initial regulatory approvals for our drug or device candidates, our drugs or devices and our manufacturing facilities would be subject to continual review and periodic inspection, and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, or device, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the marketing or manufacture of such drug or device, including withdrawal of the drug or device from the market. The FDA and other regulatory authorities stringently apply regulatory standards, and failure to comply with regulatory standards can, among other things, result in fines, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls or seizures, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nTrends toward managed health care and downward price pressure on medical products and services may limit our ability to profitably sell any drugs or devices that we develop.\nLower prices for health care products may result from:\n\u00a7\nThird-party payers' increasing challenges to the prices charged for medical products and services;\n\u00a7\nThe trend toward managed health care in the Unites States and the concurrent growth of group purchasing organizations and similar organizations that can control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products;\n\u00a7\nThe existence of government-managed health care or insurance programs in Europe and other nations, in which government agencies or committees have broad powers to approve or disapprove reimbursement and leverage to influence pricing; and\n\u00a7\nThe Affordable Care Act (or any successor act adopted in the coming years) and other proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government insurance programs.\nThe cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting, including practice protocols and guidelines and clinical pathways, and the effect of any healthcare reform, could limit our ability to profitably sell any drugs or devices that we may successfully develop. Moreover, any future legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement, may cause our business to suffer.\nWe may not successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceuticals and medical devices based on new technologies. Our failure to develop safe, commercially viable products would severely limit our ability to become profitable or to achieve significant revenues. We may be unable to successfully commercialize our product candidates because:\n\u00a7\nsome or all of our product candidates may be found to be unsafe or ineffective or otherwise fail to meet applicable regulatory standards or receive necessary regulatory clearances;\n\u00a7\nour product candidates, if safe and effective, may be too difficult to develop into commercially viable products;\n\u00a7\nwe have limited financial resources for future product development;\n\u00a7\nit may be difficult to manufacture or market our product candidates on a large scale;\n\u00a7\ngiven our limited market presence, we may be unable, directly or indirectly through licensees, to effectively market and distribute our products or establish a strong brand;\n\u00a7\nproprietary rights of third parties may preclude us from marketing our product candidates; and\n\u00a7\nthird parties may market superior or equivalent products.\n- 19 -\nThe uncertainty associated with preclinical and clinical testing may affect our ability to successfully commercialize new products.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our potential products, the product candidates may be subject to extensive preclinical and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans. In this regard, for example, adverse side effects can occur during the clinical testing of a new drug on humans which may delay ultimate FDA or other agency approval or even lead us to terminate our efforts to develop the product for commercial use. Companies in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after demonstrating promising results in earlier trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate under development could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate. A delay or failure to receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates could prevent us from successfully commercializing such candidates, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in our attempts to further develop such candidates and obtain future regulatory approval.\nRisks from the improper conduct of employees, agents or contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our business or reputation.\nWe cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including without limitation, healthcare, employment, foreign corrupt practices, environmental, competition, and privacy laws. Such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and injunctive penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations, and reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain U.S. and foreign patent protection for our drug and device candidates and processes, preserve our trade secrets and operate our business without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Legal standards relating to the validity of patents covering pharmaceutical and medical device inventions and the scope of claims made under such patents are still developing. We cannot assure you that any existing or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not subsequently be challenged, infringed upon, invalidated or circumvented by others. As a result, although we, together with our subsidiaries, are the owner of U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications now pending, and international patents and international patent applications, we cannot assure you that any additional patents will issue from any of the patent applications owned by us. In addition, as a result of liquidity shortages, we have allowed certain patents and patent applications to lapse. Furthermore, any rights that we may have under issued patents may not provide us with significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable. Patent we have been granted for our Nanoflex\u00ae technology begin to expire in 2023 and for our OraDisc\u2122 technology begin to expire in 2021. As such patents expire, it will be easier for our competitors to imitate the functionality and methods of our patented inventions.\nIn addition, patents may have been granted to third parties or may be granted covering products or processes that are necessary or useful to the development of our product candidates. If our product candidates or processes are found to infringe upon the patents or otherwise impermissibly utilize the intellectual property of others, our development, manufacture and sale of such product candidates could be severely restricted or prohibited. In such event, we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties to utilize the patents or proprietary rights of others. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. If we become involved in litigation regarding our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others, the potential cost of such litigation, regardless of the strength of our legal position, and the potential damages that we could be required to pay could be substantial and harm our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not have sufficient working capital, we may not be able to successfully enforce or defend our patent rights.\n- 20 -\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stockholders may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment if we issue additional shares of our capital stock.\nOur charter allows us to issue up to 750,000,000 shares of our Common Stock and to issue and designate the rights of, without stockholder approval, up to 20,000 shares of preferred stock. In the event we issue additional shares of our capital stock, dilution to our stockholders could result. In addition, if we issue and designate a new class of preferred stock, these securities may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock.\nRights of first offer held, or allegedly held, by shareholder may perpetuate concentration of ownership and lead to issuances of stock at lower prices than would occur absent the existence of such rights.\nWe have granted Velocitas and other persons a right of first offer, or preemptive right, permitting such persons to acquire a percentage of any securities offered by the Company (subject to certain standard exceptions) reflective of their percentage ownership in the Company. This right of first offer, if exercised, will permit these existing key affiliates of the Company to maintain their percentage ownership in the Company. In addition, the existence of this right of first offer may discourage third parties from investing in or negotiating with the Company, as a majority of the securities the third-party investors intends to purchase may instead be acquired pursuant to the right of first offer. If third party interest or demand in our securities is limited, the price at which we can sell our securities may be lower than it otherwise would be.\nIn addition, representatives of IPMD GmbH (\"IPMD\") have alleged that IPMD has a right of first offer based upon a 2012 purchase agreement, to be exercised within 30 days of written notice, to take over all, or part, of any equity-based financing made by the Company. In addition, IPMD asserts that this same 2012 purchase agreement provides it with an ongoing right to designate two directors. We dispute the scope and other aspects of the right of first offer and the asserted right to designate directors. In light of uncertainty as to who controls IPMD and internal issues at IPMD, we do not expect to be able to resolve the disputes with IPMD in the immediate future. The rights claimed by IPMD may delay or harm our ability to close future offerings and may lead to disputes with respect to the governance of the Company. In particular, the scope of the right of first offer as asserted by IPMD may limit the ability of the Company to close any offering on a short-term basis. These alleged rights could also lead to litigation in the future.\nSales of our common stock could lower our stock price.\nTrading in our Common Stock is limited, and daily trading volumes are low. As a result, the market price for our Common Stock can be harmed by the sale of even a moderate number of shares of our Common Stock. As a result of this limited market, stockholders may have difficulty in obtaining liquidity for their shares of Common Stock, and any liquidity they obtain may be at a low stock price.\nFuture sales of our common stock by us may depress the market price of our common stock and cause stockholders to experience dilution.\nThe market price of our Common Stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock directly in the public market or in private placements under circumstances in which such shares can be resold into the market. We may issue additional shares of Common Stock through one or more equity transactions in the future to satisfy our capital and operating needs; however, such transactions will be subject to market conditions and may include sales at a discount from our market prices and require issuance of warrants to purchase Common Stock. Sales of equity securities by a company at a discount from market price are often associated with a decrease in the market price of the Common Stock and will dilute the percentage interest owned by existing stockholders.\n- 21 -\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, you will have to rely on appreciation in the price of our Common Stock, if any, to earn a return on your investment in our Common Stock. Furthermore, we may in the future become subject to contractual restrictions on, or prohibitions against, the payment of dividends.\nAn investment in our common stock may be less attractive because it is not listed on a national stock exchange.\nOur Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQB\u2122 marketplace, operated by the OTC Markets Group. The OTCQB is a market tier for over-the-counter-traded companies that are registered and reporting with the SEC. The OTCQB is viewed by most investors as a less desirable, and less liquid, marketplace than a national stock exchange. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to purchase, dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the value of our Common Stock.\nOur common stock is a \"low-priced stock\" and subject to regulations that limits or restricts the potential market for our stock.\nShares of our Common Stock are \"low-priced\" or \"penny stock,\" resulting in increased risks to our investors and certain requirements being imposed on some brokers who execute transactions in our Common Stock. In general, a low-priced stock is an equity security that:\n\u00a7\nIs priced under five dollars;\n\u00a7\nIs not traded on a national stock exchange, such as NASDAQ or the NYSE;\n\u00a7\nIs issued by a company that has less than $5 million in net tangible assets (if it has been in business less than three years) or has less than $2 million in net tangible assets (if it has been in business for at least three years); and\n\u00a7\nIs issued by a company that has average revenues of less than $6 million for the past three years.\nWe believe that our Common Stock is presently a \"penny stock.\" At any time, our Common Stock qualifies as a penny stock, the following requirements, among others, will generally apply:\n\u00a7\nCertain broker-dealers who recommend penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to a transaction prior to sale.\n\u00a7\nPrior to executing any transaction involving a penny stock, certain broker-dealers must deliver to certain purchasers a disclosure schedule explaining the risks involved in owning penny stock, the broker-dealer's duties to the customer, a toll-free telephone number for inquiries about the broker-dealer's disciplinary history and the customer's rights and remedies in case of fraud or abuse in the sale.\n\u00a7\nIn connection with the execution of any transaction involving a penny stock, certain broker-dealers must deliver to certain purchasers the following:\n\u00b7 bid and offer price quotes and volume information;\n\u00b7 the broker-dealer's compensation for the trade;\n\u00b7 the compensation received by certain salespersons for the trade;\n\u00b7 monthly accounts statements; and\n\u00a7 a written statement of the customer's financial situation and investment goals.\n- 22 -\nProvisions of our charter documents could discourage an acquisition of our Company that would benefit our stockholders and may have the effect of entrenching, and making it difficult to remove, management.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company, even if a change in control would benefit our stockholders. In particular, shares of our preferred stock may be issued in the future without further stockholder approval and upon such terms and conditions, and having such rights, privileges and preferences, as our Board of Directors may determine, including for example, rights to convert into our Common Stock. The rights of the holders of our Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of our preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. This could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock and the likelihood of an acquisition.\nIn addition, our Bylaws include a requirement that shareholders who wish to nominate any candidates for director, or propose any business for a meeting of stockholders, provide our Company with advanced written notice of the nomination or the proposal, accompanied by specified information. In general, such notice must be delivered not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than 60 days after such anniversary date, then to be timely such notice must be received by the Company no later than the later of 70 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting was made. These requirements are in addition to any requirements set forth in rules adopted by the SEC. The advanced notice requirement may limit the ability of any shareholder to influence the Company by nominating a director or making a proposal, and the requirement's existence may result in decreased interest in our capital stock.", "PERMNO": 92186, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ULUR"}
