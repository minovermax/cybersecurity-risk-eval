{"cik": "1001385", "company": "NORTHWEST PIPE CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this 2020 Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. As such, you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nProject delays in public water transmission projects could adversely affect our business. The public water agencies constructing water transmission projects generally announce the projects well in advance of the bidding and construction process. It is not unusual for projects to be delayed and rescheduled. Projects are delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons, including changes in project priorities, difficulties in complying with environmental and other government regulations, changes in ability to obtain adequate project funding, and additional time required to acquire rights-of-way or property rights. Delays in public water transmission projects may occur with insufficient notice to allow us to replace those projects in our manufacturing schedules. As a result, our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows may be adversely affected by unplanned downtime.\nA downturn in government spending related to public water transmission projects could adversely affect our business. Our business is primarily dependent upon spending on public water transmission projects, including water infrastructure upgrades, repairs, and replacement and new water infrastructure spending, which in turn depends on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe need for new or replacement infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe priorities placed on various projects by governmental entities;\n\u2022\nfederal, state, and local government spending levels, including budgetary constraints related to capital projects and the ability to obtain financing; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of governmental entities to obtain environmental approvals, right-of-way permits, and other required approvals and permits.\nDecreases in the number of, or government funding of, public water transmission projects could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe face risks in connection with the integration of Geneva and future potential acquisitions and divestitures. Acquiring businesses that expand and/or complement our operations has been an important element of our business strategy, and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that may expand and/or complement our business. We may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate favorable terms in the future. Furthermore, our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on, among other things, the adequacy of our implementation plans, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations, and our ability to achieve desired operational efficiencies. Acquired businesses may have liabilities, adverse operating issues, or other matters of concern arise following the acquisition that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition. Further, our acquisition targets may not have as robust internal controls over financial reporting as would be expected of a public company. Acquisitions may also result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to potential impairment in the future that could harm our financial results. We may also consider other alternatives for our business in order to strategically position our business and continue to compete in our markets, which may include joint ventures and/or divestitures. Our failure to successfully integrate the operations of any businesses that we may acquire in the future or our inability to attract a business partner in which to enter into a joint venture or a buyer willing to purchase our assets may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe acquired Geneva on January 31, 2020. The success of this acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate this business with our current operations and to realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, from the acquisition on a timely basis. It may take longer than expected to realize these anticipated benefits and they may ultimately be smaller than we expect. There are a number of challenges and risks involved in our ability to successfully integrate Geneva with our current business and to realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition, including all of the risks identified in the previous paragraph. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business faces an overcapacity situation due to recent capacity expansions as well as the potential for increased competition from substitute products from manufacturers of concrete pressure pipe, ductile iron, polyvinyl chloride (\u201cPVC\u201d), and high-density polyethylene pipe. Orders in our business are competitively bid and price competition can be vigorous. In a market that already has overcapacity issues, recent increases in capacity have negatively affected our sales, gross margins, and overall profitability. Other competitive factors include timely delivery, ability to meet customized specifications, and high freight costs. Although our manufacturing facilities in Oregon, California, Texas, West Virginia, Utah, Missouri, and Mexico allow us to compete throughout North America, we cannot assure you that new or existing competitors will not establish new facilities or expand capacity further within our market areas. In 2019, a competitor broke ground on a new spiral welded steel pipe plant in Texas that is expected to be operational in 2021. New or expanded facilities or new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our market share, product pricing, sales, gross margins, and overall profitability in our business.\nWater transmission pipe is manufactured generally from steel, concrete, ductile iron, PVC, or HDPE. Each pipe material has advantages and disadvantages. Steel and concrete are more common materials for larger-diameter water transmission pipelines because ductile iron pipe generally is limited in diameter due to the manufacturing process. The public agencies and engineers who determine the specifications for water transmission projects analyze these pipe materials for suitability for each project. Individual project circumstances normally dictate the preferred material. If we experience cost increases in raw materials, labor, and overhead specific to our industry or the location of our facilities, while competing products or companies do not experience similar changes, we could experience an adverse change in the demand, price, and profitability of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have a foreign operation which exposes us to the risks of doing business abroad. Our facility in San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, Mexico primarily exports products to the United States. We may operate in additional countries in the future. Any material changes in the quotas, regulations, tariffs, or duties on imports imposed by the United States government and our agencies, or on exports imposed by these foreign governments and their agencies could adversely affect our foreign operations.\nWe also sell some of our products internationally. Our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in a foreign country, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of duties, tariffs, and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022\ngovernment embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nNo assurance can be given that our operations may not be adversely affected in the future. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products and services, decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products, or increasing costs such that there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We cannot assure you that we will continue to operate in compliance with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations, or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject, or that any such regulations or laws will not be modified. Any failure by us to comply with any such applicable regulations or laws, or any changes in any such regulations or laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFluctuations in steel prices and availability may affect our future results of operations. Purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature, and at times, pricing can be highly volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, import duties, other trade restrictions, and currency exchange rates. Over the past three years, steel prices have fluctuated significantly. Our average cost for a ton of steel was approximately $655 per ton in 2020, $803 per ton in 2019, and $818 per ton in 2018. In 2020, our monthly average steel purchasing costs ranged from a high of approximately $735 per ton to a low of approximately $601 per ton. This volatility can significantly affect our gross profit.\nAlthough we seek to recover increases in steel prices through price increases in our products, we have not always been successful. Any increase in steel prices that is not offset by an increase in our prices could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to acquire timely steel supplies, we may need to decline bid and order opportunities, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe success of our business is affected by general economic conditions, and our business may be adversely affected by an economic slowdown or recession. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States, or the public perception that one may occur, have and could further decrease the demand for our products, affect the price of our products, and adversely impact our business. We have been impacted in the past by the general slowing of the economy, and the economic slowdown has had an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe currently conduct a significant portion of our precast and reinforced concrete products business in Utah, which we estimate represented approximately 15% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. Local economic conditions depend on a variety of factors, including national economic conditions, local and state budgets, infrastructure spending, and the impact of federal cutbacks. Any decrease in construction activity in Utah could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur quarterly results of operations are subject to significant fluctuation. Our net sales and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe commencement, completion, or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u2022\nunplanned down time due to project delays or mechanical failure;\n\u2022\nunderutilized capacity or factory productivity;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the cost of steel and other raw materials; and\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures.\nResults of operations in any period are not indicative of results for any future period, and comparisons between any two periods may not be meaningful.\nOperating problems in our business could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Our manufacturing operations are subject to typical hazards and risks relating to the manufacture of similar products such as:\n\u2022\nexplosions, fires, inclement weather, and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nmechanical failure;\n\u2022\nunscheduled downtime;\n\u2022\nlabor difficulties;\n\u2022\nloss of process control and quality;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to supply;\n\u2022\nraw materials quality defects;\n\u2022\nservice provider delays or failures;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays or failures;\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain or maintain required licenses or permits; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards such as chemical spills, discharges, or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases into the environment or workplace.\nThe occurrence of any of these operating problems at our facilities may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on our operations as a whole, during and after the period of these operating difficulties. For example, as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this 2020 Form 10-K, on April 21, 2019, there was an accidental fire at our Saginaw, Texas facility which resulted in damage to the coatings building. There were no injuries, but the ability to coat at this facility was impaired while we repaired the damage. The operating problems listed above may also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental damage. In addition, individuals could seek damages for alleged personal injury or property damage. Furthermore, we could be subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace injury, exposure to hazardous materials, workers\u2019 compensation, and other matters. Although we maintain property and casualty insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for our industries, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liability that may be ultimately incurred or that such coverage will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Any claims that result in liability exceeding our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur recognition of revenue over time includes estimates. Revenue for water infrastructure steel pipe products is recognized over time as the manufacturing process progresses, and is measured by the costs incurred to date relative to the estimated total direct costs to fulfill each contract (cost-to-cost method). Estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for all active projects. All cost revisions that result in a material change in gross profit are reviewed by senior management personnel.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating total costs and measuring the progress of project completion, as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract change orders, contract penalty provisions, foreign currency exchange rate movements, changes in raw materials costs, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to estimates of revenue, costs, and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Due to the variability of events affecting our estimates which have a material impact on our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur backlog is subject to reduction and cancelation. Backlog, which represents the balance of remaining performance obligations under signed contracts for water infrastructure steel pipe products for which revenue is recognized over time, was approximately $167 million as of December 31, 2020. Our backlog is subject to fluctuations; moreover, cancelations of purchase orders, change orders on contracts, or reductions of product quantities could materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, future revenues. Our failure to replace canceled or reduced backlog could result in lower revenues, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental, health, and safety laws, which may require us to incur substantial compliance and remediation costs, thereby reducing our profits. We are subject to many federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the use, handling, treatment, storage, discharge, and disposal of substances and hazardous wastes used or generated in our manufacturing processes. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment, or remedial actions.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, required to incur costs relating to the environmental assessment or environmental remediation of our property, and for addressing environmental conditions, including, but not limited to, the issues associated with our Portland, Oregon facility as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this 2020 Form 10-K. Some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators, or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Consequently, we cannot assure you that existing or future circumstances, the development of new facts, or the failure of third parties to address contamination at current or former facilities or properties will not require significant expenditures by us.\nWe expect to continue to be subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. It is difficult to predict the future interpretation and development of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations or their impact on our future earnings and operations. We anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will continue to require capital expenditures and operating costs. Any increase in these costs, or unanticipated liabilities arising, for example, out of discovery of previously unknown conditions or more aggressive enforcement actions, could adversely affect our results of operations, and there is no assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims for damages for defective products, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We warrant our products to be free of certain defects. We have, from time to time, had claims alleging defects in our products. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities that may be incurred in the future or that such coverage will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liabilities exceeding our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to recover costs and damages from vendors that supply defective materials. We may receive defective materials from our vendors that are incorporated into our products during the manufacturing process. The cost to repair, remake, or replace defective products could be greater than the amount that can be recovered from the vendor. Such excess costs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur information technology systems can be negatively affected by cybersecurity threats. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats, and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches. This could lead to disclosure, modification, or destruction of proprietary, employee, and other key information and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness, and results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or protected personal information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers, and employees, lead to claims against us, and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. Any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages, staffing shortages, and other labor matters. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 63 employees that were represented by a single labor union. Although we believe that our relations with our employees and the labor union are good, no assurances can be made that we will not experience conflicts with the labor union, other groups representing employees, or our employees in general, especially in the context of any future negotiations with the labor union. We can also make no assurance that future negotiations with the labor union will not result in a significant increase in the cost of labor.\nAdditionally, the employees of some of our customers are unionized. Any strikes, work stoppages, or other labor matters experienced by our customers may impact our ability to work on projects and, as a result, have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to develop or successfully market new products or our products might not obtain necessary approvals or achieve market acceptance, which could adversely affect our growth. We will continue to actively seek to develop new products and to expand our existing products into new markets, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts. If we are unsuccessful in developing and marketing new products, expanding into new markets, or we do not obtain or maintain requisite approvals for our products, the demand for our products could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it will impact our employees, customers, supply chain, and distribution network. These impacts could include, without limitation, disruptions in or closures of our manufacturing operations or those of our customers and suppliers, disruptions within our supply chain or distribution channels, limitations on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel, potential financial difficulties of customers and suppliers, significant changes in economic or political conditions impacting project owners\u2019 ability to fund future projects, and related financial and commodity volatility, including volatility in raw material and other input costs.\nWe have taken proactive and precautionary steps to ensure the safety of our employees, customers, and suppliers, including frequent cleaning and disinfection of workspaces, providing personal protective equipment, instituting social distancing measures, and offering remote working environments for certain employees. These measures may reduce the ability of our employees to operate at the same level of productivity and efficiency. In early April 2020, we were ordered to close our water infrastructure manufacturing facility in San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, Mexico as a result of mandates made by Mexican authorities related to COVID-19. In early June 2020, the Mexican authorities determined our SLRC facility was essential, and allowed weekly increases to our workforce. By July 2020, operations at our SLRC facility were fully restored.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse effect on our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2020, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The severity of impacts on the global economy and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities to contain the pandemic or treat its impact.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in Part I - Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this 2020 Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe will need to substantially increase working capital if market conditions and customer order levels improve. If market conditions and customer order levels were to dramatically increase, we will have to increase our working capital substantially, as it takes several months for new orders to be translated into cash receipts. In general, revolving loan borrowings and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) dated October 25, 2018 (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), as amended on January 31, 2020 by the Consent and Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo (collectively the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d), are limited to the aggregate amount of $74 million, subject to a borrowing base. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding revolving loan borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement and additional revolving loan borrowing capacity of approximately $53 million. We may not have sufficient availability under the Amended Credit Agreement to borrow the amounts we need, and other opportunities to borrow additional funds or raise capital in the equity markets may be limited or nonexistent. A shortage in the availability of working capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur debt obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We have financed our operations through cash flows from operations, available borrowings, and other financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had $13.8 million of outstanding long-term debt, no outstanding revolving loan borrowings, $1.7 million of finance lease liabilities, and $30.1 million of operating lease liabilities. We could incur additional revolving loan borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement in the future to finance increases in working capital, finance mergers, acquisitions and capital expenditures, fund negative operating cash flows, or for other corporate purposes. These borrowings could become significant in the future.\nOur current and future debt and debt service obligations could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes in the future;\n\u2022\nreduce the amount of funds available to finance our operations, capital expenditures, and other activities;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns, illiquid capital markets, and adverse industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates, cause us to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our current and future debt will depend on our future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions, prevailing interest rate levels, and other financial, competitive, and business factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our inability to make scheduled payments on our debt or any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, under the Amended Credit Agreement, our variable rate indebtedness uses daily three month London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the rate. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop publishing daily three month LIBOR rates on June 30, 2023. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. The Amended Credit Agreement provides a mechanism for determining an alternative benchmark rate to LIBOR, which may include SOFR. It is not presently known whether SOFR or any other alternative reference rates that have been proposed will attain market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR. As such, the transition to alternatives to LIBOR could be modestly disruptive to the credit markets. While we do not believe that the impact would be material to us, the consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods, and could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the financial markets and a general economic slowdown could cause us to be unable to obtain financing and expose us to risks related to the overall macro-economic environment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The United States equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many equities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing, even for companies who are otherwise qualified to obtain financing. These events may make it less likely that we will be able to obtain additional financing and also may make it more difficult or prohibitively costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nOur failure to comply with covenants in our debt agreements could result in our indebtedness being immediately due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The agreements governing our debt include covenants that impose certain requirements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations and general business activities. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur certain additional debt and to create liens or other encumbrances on assets. In addition, our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in certain real property owned by us and our subsidiaries and substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' other assets.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments in the future is uncertain and will be affected by our results of operations and financial condition as well as other events and circumstances beyond our control. If market and other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the requirements of these covenants, if not waived or cured, could permit acceleration of the related debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient assets to repay such debt or that we would be able to refinance such debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The acceleration of a significant portion of our current and future debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business. If in the future we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nFailure to implement internal controls at acquired companies could increase risk of material weaknesses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires our management to assess the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for the companies we acquire. In order to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will need to implement or enhance internal control over financial reporting at any company we acquire and evaluate the internal controls. We do not conduct a formal evaluation of companies\u2019 internal control over financial reporting prior to an acquisition. We may experience difficulties in implementing effective internal controls as part of our integration of acquisitions from private companies, as they may have limited experience complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may be required to hire or engage additional resources and incur substantial costs to implement the necessary new internal controls should we acquire any companies. Any failure to implement required internal controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or increase the risk of material weaknesses in internal controls, which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe relatively low trading volume of our common stock may limit your ability to sell your shares. Although our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), we have historically experienced a relatively low trading volume. If we have a low trading volume in the future, holders of our shares may have difficulty selling a large number of shares of our common stock in the manner or at a price that might otherwise be attainable.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as earnings per share, net income, and net sales;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;\n\u2022\nloss of any member of our senior management team;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructuring;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by shareholders;\n\u2022\nrelatively low trading volume;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and market expectations for our industry and the financial health of our customers; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced broad fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
