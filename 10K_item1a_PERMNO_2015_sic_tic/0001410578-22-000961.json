RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and prospects are subject to the following risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently foreseeable to us may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in the shares of our common stock.\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cintends\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cpossibly,\u201d \u201cprobably,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d or \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cdesigned to,\u201d \u201cdesigned for,\u201d or other variations or similar words or language. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nSHOULD ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INCORRECT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, BELIEVED, ESTIMATED, EXPECTED, INTENDED OR PLANNED\nRisks Related to Pandemics\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow.\nSince March 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, as well as those from new strains of the virus. The Company monitors the near term and longer term impacts of COVID-19 and any related business and travel restrictions and other changes intended to reduce its spread, and its impact on operations, financial position, cash flows, inventory, supply chains, purchasing trends, customer payments, and the industry in general, in addition to the impact on its employees. Due to the nature of the pandemic, while presently the level of the pandemic is low, the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the Company\u2019s operations, liquidity and financial performance may depend on certain developments, including duration, spread and reemergence of the outbreak, its impact on our customers, supply chain partners and employees, and the range of governmental and community reactions to the pandemic.\nIt is unclear how such restrictions, which will contribute to a general slowdown in the global economy, will affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and our future strategic plans.\nThe digester line of our business has historically been marketed to large organizations such as food distributors, convention centers, hotels, restaurants, stadiums, municipalities and academic institutions. Should there be a resurgence of a pandemic, it is unclear how a prolonged outbreak with travel, commercial and other similar restrictions, may adversely affect our business operations and the business operations of our customers and suppliers; a disruption for a prolonged period will have a negative effect on our business operations.\nShelter-in-place and essential-only travel regulations negatively impacted many of our customers. In addition, while our digesters are manufactured in the United States, we still at risk of supply chain disruptions due to interruptions in operations at any or all of our suppliers\u2019 facilities. If we experience significant delays in receiving our products, we will experience delays in fulfilling orders and ultimately receiving payment, which could result in loss of sales and a loss of customers, and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe MBT line of our business is classified as a public service in the state in which it is located and would not be materially impacted by general restrictions that may be imposed on other businesses in its area. The Facility relies upon other entities to pick up and deliver municipal solid waste, which are also classified as public service entities, and is reliant upon customers in the cement kiln industry to purchase its solid recovered fuel. The inability to receive municipal solid waste (\u201cMSW\u201d) or sell it to its customers would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Specific to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability due to the competitive and evolving nature of the industries in which we operate. Our failure to sustain profitability could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a consolidated net loss of $24,323,475, incurred a consolidated loss from operations of $18,516,674 and used net cash in consolidated operating activities of $6,846,192. As of December 31, 2021, consolidated total stockholders\u2019 deficit amounted to $10,102,010, and the Company had a consolidated working capital deficit of $41,817,881. This working capital deficit includes the WVEDA nonrecourse bonds of $33,000,000 that are collateralized by the Facility and the membership interests in EWV for which the EWV has not met certain covenants, financial and otherwise, which is classified as a current liability. In addition, the Company had not met certain of its senior secured note's financial covenants as of December 31, 2021 amounting to $3,275,000 which has also been classified as current debt. Additionally, EWV has also defaulted on scheduled payments to a junior unsecured series of notes from EntsorgaFin S.p.A, (\"EFin\") a minority member of EWV, amounting to $1,254,696 as of December 31, 2021 which is classified as a current liability. The Company does not yet have a history of financial profitability. In February 2021 and during the fourth quarter of 2021 the Company raised net proceeds of $8,558,669 through an At-The-Market series and through an Equity Facility Line series of transactions. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the Company received proceeds of $1,118,401 through the sales of common stock and warrants in a Private Investment In Public company transaction. There is no assurance that the Company will continue to raise sufficient capital or debt to sustain operations or to pursue other strategic initiatives or that such financing will be on terms that are favorable to the Company. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe face substantial competition in the waste services industry, and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe waste services industry is highly competitive, has undergone a period of consolidation and requires substantial labor and capital resources. Some of the markets in which we compete are served by one or more of large, established companies, that are more well-known and better financed than we are. Intense competition exists not only to provide services to customers, but also to develop new products and services and acquire other businesses within each market. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do.\nIn our waste disposal markets, we also compete with operators of alternative disposal and recycling facilities. We also increasingly compete with companies that seek to use waste as feedstock for alternative uses. Public entities may have financial advantages because of their ability to charge user fees or similar charges, impose tax revenues, access tax-exempt financing and, in some cases, utilize government subsidies.\nIf we are unable to successfully compete in the marketplace, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe waste services industry is subject to extensive and rapidly-changing government regulation. Changes to one or more of these regulations could cause a decrease in the demand for our products and services.\nStringent government regulations at the federal, state and local level in the U.S. have a substantial impact on the waste industry and compliance with such regulations is costly. A large number of complex laws, rules, orders and interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. Among other things, governmental regulations and enforcement actions may restrict operations within the waste industry and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe believe the demand for our digester product is created directly in response to recent laws and regulation prohibiting certain large, commercial food manufacturers, retailers and hospitality enterprises from discarding food wastes to landfills. Our digesters are just one solution for these businesses to comply with these regulations and other regulations. If there was a change to or elimination of these regulations, the demand for our product would almost certainly be greatly reduced and our income would, as a result, be adversely affected.\nCurrently, the microorganisms we employ in our digesters are approved for use to reduce food waste and to be poured into conventional sewer systems. However, if it was determined that we could no longer use these microorganisms, there is no guarantee that we could develop a replacement process to assure that we could continue to sell our products. Also, we would likely face claims from current customers were they unable to use our digesters for food waste disposal.\nWe may also incur the costs of defending against environmental litigation brought by governmental agencies and private parties. We may be in the future a defendant in lawsuits brought by parties alleging environmental damage, personal injury, and/or property damage, or which seek to overturn or prevent authorization of our products, all of which may result in us incurring significant liabilities.\nWe may be negatively impacted by landfills and certain long-term disposal trends.\nIn connection with the MBT line of business, there is competition from other landfills, including large, out-of-state landfills to secure municipal solid waste (\u201cMSW\u201d) feedstock. Such facilities may legally drop prices to maintain market share forcing the Company to compete on price for feedstock delivered by suppliers, which may cause a negative impact to the anticipated financial performance of the projects and may result in an impairment of such projects.\nWaste policies may incentivize additional renewable energy plants to be built, in such an event, the MBT facilities would be competing with such future renewable energy plants for feedstock. Furthermore, other zero waste policies, increased local recycling and reuse, augmented by composting and other future waste policies intended to eliminate and/or reduce the waste may mean less MSW will be available for the Company\u2019s MBT projects.\nThe recovered recycled materials market is volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s MBT projects and its waste collections business anticipate a minimum return on recycled materials. Should conditions change such that the minimum returns cannot be recovered, they may have a negative impact on the financial performance of the projects and businesses.\nThe market for solid recovered fuel (\u201cSRF\u201d) is not developed.\nThe Company\u2019s MBT projects rely upon the ability to sell SRF to appropriate industrial users at economically reasonable prices. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to contract on either a long-term or spot-market basis with such consumers.\nFuture Acquisitions.\nWe may in the future, make acquisitions in order to acquire complementing or expanding our business, including developing additional disposal products and complementary services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates. If we identify suitable acquisition candidates, we may be unable to successfully negotiate acquisitions at a price or on terms and conditions acceptable to us, including as a result of the limitations imposed by our debt obligations. Further, we may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval, if required, to complete potential acquisitions. We may be unable to complete these transactions and, if executed, these transactions may not improve our business or may pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits of any potential future acquisition, including cost savings and operating efficiencies, depends in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with our operations. The integration of acquired businesses and other assets may require significant management time and resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing management of our existing operations. In addition, to the extent any future acquisitions are completed, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or their operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on future profitability. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate, or realize any anticipated benefits from, acquisitions include:\n\u25cf unexpected losses of key employees or customer of the acquired company;\n\u25cf difficulties integrating the acquired company\u2019s standards, processes, procedures and controls;\n\u25cf difficulties coordinating new product and process development;\n\u25cf difficulties hiring additional management and other critical personnel;\n\u25cf difficulties increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u25cf difficulties consolidating facilities, transferring processes and know-how;\n\u25cf difficulties reducing costs of the acquired company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from our management; and\n\u25cf adverse impacts on retaining existing business relationships with customers.\nOur business and strategic plans may require funding.\nOur current business and strategic plans require additional funding. Our ultimate success may depend on our ability to raise additional financing and capital. In the absence of additional financing or significant revenues and profits, the Company will have to approach its business plan from a much different and much more restricted direction, attempting to secure additional funding sources to fund its growth, borrowing money from lenders or elsewhere or to take other actions to attempt to provide funding. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed, or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us.\nWe expect that we will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and can be expected to dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nBased upon present strategic investment plans, we will need to raise additional capital in the future. Such additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We may need to raise additional funds through borrowings or public or private debt or equity financings to meet various objectives including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf accomplish growth through enhanced sales and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf effect new products and services development; and\n\u25cf complete business acquisitions.\nOur limited operating history does not afford investors a sufficient history on which to base an investment decision.\nWe are currently expanding our businesses. Our operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of an expanding business enterprise. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that are frequently encountered in expanding companies. There can be no assurance that at this time that we will operate profitably or will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due.\nInvestors must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by expanding companies, particularly in rapidly evolving markets. Such risks include the following:\n\u25cf increasing awareness of our brand names;\n\u25cf meeting customer demand and standards;\n\u25cf attaining customer loyalty;\n\u25cf developing and upgrading our product and service offerings;\n\u25cf implementing our advertising and marketing plan;\n\u25cf maintaining our current strategic relationships and developing new strategic relationships;\n\u25cf responding effectively to competitive pressures; and\n\u25cf attracting, retaining and motivating qualified personnel.\nWe cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks. In the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and we may not have the resources to continue or expand our business operations.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate existing employees. Due to our reliance upon its skilled professionals and laborers, the failure to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain current and/or additional key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to manage growth or to prepare for product scalability and integration effectively, it could have an adverse effect on our employee efficiency, product quality, working capital levels and results of operations.\nAny significant growth in the market for our products or our entry into new markets may require an expansion of our employee base for managerial, operational, financial, and other purposes. During any period of growth, we may face problems related to our operational and financial systems and controls, including quality control and delivery and service capacities. We would also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee base. Continued future growth will impose significant added responsibilities upon the members of management to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate, and motivate new employees.\nAside from increased difficulties in the management of human resources, we may need increased liquidity to finance the expansion of our existing business, the development of new products, and the hiring of additional employees. For effective growth management, we will be required to continue improving our operations, management, and financial systems and controls. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational and financial inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers.\nOur management team may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies.\nIf our management team is unable to execute on its business strategies, then our development, including the establishment of revenues and our sales and marketing activities, would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by any future growth. We may seek to augment or replace members of our management team or we may lose key members of our management team, and we may not be able to attract new management talent with sufficient skill and experience.\nIf we are unable to retain key executives and other key affiliates, our growth could be significantly inhibited, and our business harmed with a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the management, sales and marketing, and operational and technical expertise of certain key personnel. Anthony Fuller, our Chief Executive Officer and Brian C. Essman, our Chief Financial Officer, perform key functions in the operation of our business. The loss of either of these could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we lose the services of any senior management, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel, which could severely disrupt our business and prospects.\nOur financial results may not meet the expectations of investors and may fluctuate because of many factors and, as a result, investors should not rely on our revenue and/or financial projections as indicative of future results.\nFluctuations in operating results or the failure of operating results to meet the expectations investors may negatively impact the value of our securities. Operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors that could affect revenues or expenses in any particular quarter. Fluctuations in operating results could cause the value of our securities to decline. Investors should not rely on revenue or financial projections or comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance. As a result of the factors listed below, it is possible that in future periods results of operations may be below the expectations of investors. This could cause the market price of our securities to decline and negatively impact our ability to raise debt and capital. Factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u25cf delays in sales resulting from potential customer sales cycles;\n\u25cf variations or inconsistencies in return on investment models and results;\n\u25cf changes in competition; and\n\u25cf changes or threats of significant changes in legislation or rules or standards that would change the drivers for product adoption.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nWe are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission or the SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on the effectiveness of such company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in its annual report. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate as a public company.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Based on their evaluations, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of our limited operations we have a small number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. As we grow and expand our operations, we will engage additional employees and experts as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand.\nOur failure to remediate the material weakness or our failure to discover and address any other material weaknesses or deficiencies may result in inaccuracies in our financial statements, delay in the preparation of our financial statements, and the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively influence the trading price of our Common Stock. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could also expose us to increased risk of fraud or misappropriations of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which our Common Stock is listed, regulatory investigations or civil or criminal sanctions. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are operating in a highly competitive market and we are unsure as to whether there will be any consumer demand for our services.\nSome of our competitors are much larger and better capitalized than we are. It may be that our competitors will better address the same market opportunities that we are addressing. These competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing business models that are more effective or have greater market success than our own. The Company is especially susceptible to larger companies that invest more money in marketing. Moreover, the market for our services is potentially large but highly competitive. There is little or no hard data that substantiates the demand for our services or how this demand will be segmented over time.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will operate profitably or will generate positive cash flow.\nThe Company is continuing to develop and expand its lines of business, customer base and recurring revenues and it is anticipated that it may continue to incur losses in the future as it carries on this process. In addition, the Company\u2019s operating results in the future may be subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors not within our control, such as the level of competition, regulatory changes and general economic conditions.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to use digital and other viral marketing to expand consumer awareness of our service.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase the efficacy of our digital and other viral marketing strategy or if we otherwise decide to expand the reach of our marketing through use of costlier marketing campaigns, we may experience an increase in marketing expenses that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding our customer base and failure to do so would materially reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be negatively impacted by permitting and construction risks.\nIn connection with the MBT line of business, while the Company intends on providing consulting and other services to entities in developing MBT facilities, those facilities will have to maintain or acquire specialized permits and have regulatory approvals from various state and local regulatory authorities for their operations or the construction of facilities. This permitting process may involve initial denials of permits that are appealed. The failure of having such may delay, or prevent the construction or operation of the planned MBT facilities, which would also impair the capitalized MBT facility development and license costs associated with such projects. In addition, there are significant risks related to the construction of a specialized facility. These risks may delay, postpone or cause a negative impact to the anticipated financial performance of the projects.\nA recent pause in the operations of our Martinsburg, WV facility may impact its future business opportunities.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2021, the Company commenced an operational and strategic review of Entsorga West Virginia LLC (\u201cEWV\u201d) and its facility based MBT operations in Martinsburg, West Virginia (the \u201cFacility\u201d) that resulted in a decision to pause production operations to allow for reducing losses and cash requirements from the Facility. During the pause period, customers, employees and vendors may be impacted. Upon resumption of the Facility, it is uncertain if all of the Facility\u2019s customers, employees and vendors will resume their past activities with the Facility. In addition, under the Facility\u2019s operating license, lease and its debt instruments; the issuing agency, landlord and bond trustee, respectively may take actions that could inhibit the return of operations of the Facility. These risks may delay the resumption of operations or cause a negative impact to the anticipated financial performance of the Facility.\nRisks Related to Securities Markets and Investments in Our Securities\nGeneral securities market uncertainties resulting from COVID-19.\nAt the outset of COVID-19 the U.S. and worldwide national securities markets underwent unprecedented stress due to the uncertainties of COVID-19 and the resulting reactions and outcomes of government, business and the general population. These uncertainties resulted in declines in market sectors, increases in volumes due to flight to safety and governmental actions to support the markets. Should there be a significant resurgence or a new form of pandemic, it is unknown how the securities markets will be impacted. Should we not be able to obtain financing when required, in the amounts necessary to execute on our plans in full, or on terms which are economically feasible we may be unable to sustain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan and may have to reduce the planned future growth and scope of our operations.\nAbility to Maintain Nasdaq Compliance.\nOn January 10, 2022, Renovare Environmental, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) was notified (the \u201cNotification Letter\u201d) by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Notification Letter, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement. The Notification Letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market and, at this time, the common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cRENO\u201d.\nThe Notification Letter provides that the Company has 180 calendar days, or until July 11, 2022, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by July 11, 2022, the Company may then be eligible for additional 180 days if it meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Company does not qualify for the second compliance period or fails to regain compliance during the second compliance period, then Nasdaq will notify the Company of its determination to delist the Company\u2019s common stock, at which point the Company will have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.\nThe Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options, including, but not limited to, implementing a reverse stock split of its outstanding securities, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nOur executive officers and certain stockholders possess significant voting power, and through this ownership, could influence our Company and our corporate actions.\nOur current executive officers, directors and their affiliates, hold approximately 16% of the voting power of the outstanding common shares as of the date of December 31, 2021. These officers, directors, affiliates and certain stockholders may have a controlling influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors, and other significant corporate actions. As such, our executive officers have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control; therefore, without their consent we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us. The interests of our executive officers and certain shareholders may give rise to a conflict of interest with the Company and the Company\u2019s stockholders. For additional details concerning voting power please refer to the section below entitled \u201cDescription of Securities.\u201d\nLiquidity of our common stock has been limited.\nOn April 9, 2018 the Company uplisted from OTCQB to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The liquidity of our Common Stock has been mixed and there is no assurance that liquidity will continue or that the trade prices of our securities could not be reduced due to excess sellers of our stock over buyers. Active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. Absence of an active trading market reduces the liquidity of the shares traded.\nThe trading volume of our Common Stock may be limited and sporadic. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they may tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares of Common Stock until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods when trading activity in our shares is minimal, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf the concentration of the ownership of our shares by a limited number of affiliated stockholders may limit interest in our securities;\n\u25cf limited \u201cpublic float\u201d with a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf loss of a strategic relationship;\n\u25cf variations in operating results from the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u25cf announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf reductions in the market share of our products;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf investor perception of our industry or prospects;\n\u25cf insider selling or buying;\n\u25cf investors entering into short sale contracts;\n\u25cf regulatory developments affecting our industry;\n\u25cf changes in our industry;\n\u25cf competitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or reductions in security analysts\u2019 coverage; and\n\u25cf economic and other external factors.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time, including as to whether our Common Stock will sustain current market prices, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.\nThe market price of our Common Stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our Common Stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting the Company\u2019s competitors or the Company itself.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue operations.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our Common Stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our Common Stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. A decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity, our operations and strategic plans. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new services and continue our current operations. If our Common Stock price declines, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.\nConcentrated ownership of our Common Stock creates a risk of sudden changes in our Common Stock price.\nThe sale by any shareholder of a significant portion of their holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales of our currently issued and outstanding Common Stock may become freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 and may dilute the market for your shares and have a depressive effect on the price of the shares of our common stock.\nApproximately 16% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of December 31, 2021 are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) (\u201cRule 144\u201d). As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that a non-affiliate who has held restricted securities for a period of at least six months may sell their shares of Common Stock. Under Rule 144, affiliates who have held restricted securities for a period of at least six months may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of a company\u2019s outstanding shares of Common Stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Securities Act, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registrations of our shares of Common Stock, may have a depressive effect upon the price of our shares of common stock in any active market that may develop.\nIf we issue additional shares or derivative securities in the future, it may result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares, or derivative securities to purchase some or all of such shares, to provide additional financing in the future.\nWe do not plan to declare or pay any dividends to our stockholders in the near future.\nWe have not declared any Common Stock dividends in the past, and we do not intend to distribute cash dividends in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future Common Stock dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the Securities Act of 1933 and as well as the governance rules of Nasdaq. These rules, regulations and requirements are extensive. We may incur significant costs associated with our public company corporate governance and reporting requirements. This may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting standards and varying interpretations of accounting standards have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business.\n\u201cPenny Stock\u201d rules may make buying or selling our Common Stock difficult.\nTrading in our Common Stock has previously been subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer that recommends our common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors, must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our Common Stock, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 17680, "SIC": 3590, "TIC": "BHTG"}
