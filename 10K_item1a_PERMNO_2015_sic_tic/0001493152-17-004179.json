{"cik": "1001601", "company": "MGT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nDiscussion of our business and operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of our securities. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this prospectus (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future developments.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in commercializing any of the technologies or products acquired and/or developed, or if any of our technologies or products are commercialized, that they will be profitable for the Company.\nThe Company generates limited revenue from operations upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be made. The Company\u2019s prospects must be considered keeping in mind the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business in a constantly changing industry. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve profitable operations in the foreseeable future, if at all.\nThe Company has identified a number of specific risk areas that may affect our operations and results in the future:\nCompany Specific Risks\nGoing Concern Risks\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and do not include adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had incurred significant operating losses since inception, and continues to generate losses from operations, and has an accumulated deficit of $328,467. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements incorporated in this Annual Report do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have had limited commercial results and revenues, and we may be required to curtail operations if adequate funds are not available to us.\nOur commercial results have been limited. Historically, the Company has not generated significant revenues to fund its operations, and the Company does not expect that revenues will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s primary source of operating funds since inception has been debt and equity financings. At December 31, 2016, MGT\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $345. The Company intends to raise additional capital, either through debt or equity financings, in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to do so. There is no assurance, moreover, that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail its operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. The Company may also attempt to obtain funds through entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products that the Company would not otherwise relinquish. There can be no assurance that any such plan will be successful.\nRisks Associated with Our Being a Development Stage Company\nWe have recently refocused our business, so that our historical operations are not indicative of future results.\nWe were originally formed as an internet and technology business, and later became involve in medical imaging technology. Most recently, we focused our activities principally on the online and mobile gaming space and the social casino industry. In September 2015, the Company disposed of substantially all its equity interest in DraftDay Gaming Group, Inc., its principal gaming property, and began repositioning itself as a participant in the cybersecurity industry. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s performance and operating results in prior periods are unlikely to be indicative of its future operating performance.\nWe are now a development stage company in the cybersecurity industry, and our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of development stage companies generally.\nThe Company has just begun its entry into the cybersecurity industry with the acquisition of its Sentinel product. We are also exploring other acquisitions in the cybersecurity space. The products on which the Company is currently focused, and products and applications which the Company hopes to acquire in the future, are, or are expected to be, in the early stages of development and/or commercialization, with the anticipation that the Company will be able to build substantial value in the products over time.\nAs a consequence of this strategy, the Company expects that the revenues generated by its product offering, at least initially, will be not be sufficient to cover its administrative, research and development, marketing expenses. Therefore, as is typical with many development stage companies, the Company will be relying for the foreseeable future on its cash on hand and its ability to raise additional capital, rather than operating revenues, in order to fund the majority of its operating expenses.\nAs a development stage company, we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nFor the foreseeable future, the Company is not expected to experience positive earnings. While typical of development stage companies, the absence of earnings will make the Company more difficult to value, which may result in wide swings in its share price that are unrelated to the fundamental operations or prospects of its businesses.\nDespite our optimism that the Company\u2019s business strategy is sound and that we will ultimately achieve profitability, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the course of our future operations, including expected growth through as yet unidentified acquisitions in the cybersecurity business and as yet undetermined new product offerings. The time period that will be required for our Company to achieve profitability and positive cash flow, or whether such profitability and cash flow will be at all achievable, is indeterminate.\nThe Company could be confused with a shell company.\nThe Company currently employs 2 people in management and administration at its office in Harrison, New York, 2 people in marketing and communications who work remotely, and 4 engineering and management personnel in product development at its main facility in Durham, North Carolina. The Company currently engages 4 engineers on a consulting basis, some of whom may be expected to become Company employees in the future. The Company also owns bitcoin machines in a hosted environment in Cashmere, Washington. Also, the Company has three advisory boards, a four-member Hacker Advisory Board, a two member Emerging Large Scale Technology Board and a three member Cryptocurrency Advisory Board. At its current level of operation, the Company is not a shell company under applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nevertheless, because the Company has recently disposed of, and has ceased to conduct, its legacy online sports gaming business, and has only recently begun it activities in the cybersecurity space, it is possible that the Company could be confused with a shell company. This erroneous perception could have adverse consequences for the Company\u2019s market valuation, as well as for its relationships with potential customers, potential joint venture partners and other constituencies. The Company expects the risk of this perception to diminish as the level of the Company\u2019s operations increases.\nRisks Associated with Management and Other Personnel\nThe Company will be relying on John McAfee, one of the pioneers of the cybersecurity industry, to provide vision and direction, but we cannot assure you that his association with the Company will result in our commercial success, and the Company could lose the benefit of Mr. McAfee\u2019s services.\nJohn McAfee, one of the pioneers of the cybersecurity industry is currently Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as well as our executive chairman. In addition to founding McAfee Associates, one of the leading anti-virus protections firms, Mr. McAfee has been involved with numerous other ventures in the cybersecurity space. The Company anticipates that Mr. McAfee\u2019s experience and vision will be an invaluable resource to the Company as it seeks to identify, develop and commercialize additional product offerings in the cybersecurity space. The Company also believes that Mr. McAfee\u2019s association with the Company will provide it with name recognition and credibility among customers, vendors, industry professionals and market participants. For this reason, the Company is proposing to rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies.\nWe cannot assure you, however, that Mr. McAfee will be able to replicate his prior successes at the Company. Also, while Mr. McAfee occupies the position of executive chairman and CEO, he does not manage the day-to-day operations of the Company, and Mr. McAfee may continue to have other interests that are unrelated to the Company. In addition, while Mr. McAfee has committed himself to the Company, and has a substantial equity stake in the Company via stock options, we cannot guarantee that the Company will continue to have the benefit of his services after his two-year employment agreement expires. Furthermore, despite his equity interest, he could determine to disassociate himself from the Company, or Mr. McAfee could die or become disabled, and the Company has determined that it cannot obtain key person insurance on Mr. McAfee on economically reasonable terms. Finally, Mr. McAfee has been the subject of certain publicity with respect to his personal life, particularly with respect to the time when he was residing in Belize, which could be viewed as adverse to the Company. Despite these risks, the Company believes that Mr. McAfee\u2019s association with the Company will provide substantial direct and indirect benefits to the Company and will contribute the Company\u2019s hoped for success in the cybersecurity space.\nThe Company is continuing to assemble a management team appropriate to its cybersecurity business, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in identifying and engaging suitable candidates.\nThe Company has retained John McAfee because the Company believes he has the experience and expertise to guide the Company in development of its cybersecurity business. The Company anticipates, however, that it will require other management personnel to complement and assist Mr. McAfee in the operational leadership of the Company. In particular, the Company is in the process of identifying candidates for a permanent chief financial officer and the position of chief operating officer, and the Company also expects to pursue the engagement of other members of senior management. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying appropriate candidates for the positions that it seeks to fill, or that any candidates identified will be prepared to be employed by the Company on terms that are commercially reasonable. Also, because the Company is in the development stage and the precise direction of its cybersecurity business could evolve over time, the management roles, qualifications and positions that are most suitable to the Company\u2019s businesses may change, which may result in the Company making changes in its management personnel and structure. Such management changes could be costly to the Company and could result in inefficiencies and dislocations that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s development.\nWe may fail to attract and retain other qualified personnel.\nThere is intense competition from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations for qualified personnel in the area of cyber technology. As a development stage company with a limited operating history, we may fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate the kind of highly skilled personnel that we require to develop our products and grow our business. Although we believe that the opportunity to work alongside Mr. McAfee and Mr. Andersen, who we believe are recognized leaders in the cybersecurity industry, and what we believe are the growth prospects afforded by our industry, will allow us to attract the qualified personnel that we require, we cannot assure you that this will be the case.\nRisks Associated with Potential Acquisitions\nThe Company\u2019s business plan contemplates additional acquisitions of cybersecurity businesses and products, but there is no assurance that it will be successful with its acquisition program.\nThe Company anticipates that a substantial portion of the future growth of its products and services will come through acquisitions. Other than the proposed acquisition of the assets of D-Vasive and Demonsaw (see below), the Company has not identified specific businesses that it is presently intending to acquire. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying suitable businesses of entities for acquisition, or that if identified, the Company will have the resources, whether cash or available securities, to consummate the acquisition. There can also be no assurance that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will be financial and business successes, in the near term or at all, or that the Company would have the resources to adequately develop the business opportunities offered by the acquisitions. It is also possible that the Company would not have sufficient financial, personnel and other resources to fully exploit the businesses existing at the time of an acquisition or the business of an acquisition, with the result that the development of one or more of the existing businesses and acquired businesses would suffer, at least in the short term.\nYou should also be aware that, while a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s anticipated growth is expected to result from its acquisition activity, stockholders will generally not be asked to approve an acquisition, unless required by applicable law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the Company\u2019s shares may be listed at the time. Thus, it is possible that the Company could engage in one or more acquisitions that would alter the direction of the Company\u2019s business and operations without stockholders having a formal say on whether to pursue such acquisition transactions.\nAcquisitions could also entail other potential risks.\nAcquisition activity typically involves other significant risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u25cf inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u25cf challenges in retaining key employees, customers and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition;\n\u25cf an impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods would result in a charge to earnings in the period in which the write-down occurs;\n\u25cf the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards and may require significant time and resources to improve; and\n\u25cf potential liability for activities of the acquired companies undertaken before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\nRisks Associated with the Cybersecurity Industry\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing our cybersecurity products.\nOur current and currently proposed cybersecurity products are in the initial stages of commercialization, and we expect that the same will be the case with respect to the products of other businesses that we acquire. Because of the rapidly evolving nature of the cybersecurity industry, and the constantly changing threats that cybersecurity products are intended to address, our products may require continuous and effective upgrades in order to obtain effective recognition and commercial traction in the cybersecurity marketplace. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in commercializing any of our cybersecurity products or, if they are commercialized, that they will be profitable for the Company.\nThe cybersecurity market is intensely competitive.\nWe believe that the cybersecurity industry offers great opportunity because of the increasing, highly publicized cybersecurity breaches being experienced in virtually all segments the business and government sectors. We also believe that the historical approaches to protecting servers and personal computers are not suited to mobile devices and cloud computing, opening up a substantial array of possibilities for capturing market share in the cybersecurity industry.\nNonetheless, the cybersecurity market is already very competitive, and it is characterized by rapid change. We will be competing with numerous vendors in the cybersecurity space. The overall number of our competitors providing niche cyber-attack solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories.\nSome of these competitors may also introduce various products that compete with different products that we offer, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors will have substantially greater resources, including technical, engineering and marketing resources, than we will.\nWe also may face competition from customers to which we may license or supply technology and suppliers from which we may transfer or license technology. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.\nThe information security market may not adopt our cybersecurity technologies and/or products.\nWe seek to acquire and develop products that provide advanced protection technologies across a variety of platforms, including mobile and personal technology devices. However, even if we are successful in acquiring or developing such technologies, if we are unable to convince customers that our technologies and products should be an integral part of their overall approach to information security, we will not be able to grow our business as anticipated.\nMoreover, even if there is significant demand for our technologies and products, if our competitors\u2019 products include functionalities that are, or are perceived to be, better than or equivalent to that offered by us, we may have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our technologies and products. Furthermore, even if the functionality offered by other cybersecurity technologies or products is more limited than the functionality of our own, customers may elect to accept such limited functionality, and thus not accept or adopt the technologies and products offered by the Company.\nOur cybersecurity technologies and/or products may not perform as intended.\nEven the most advanced cybersecurity products cannot guarantee 100% security against all forms of intrusion, as evidenced by successful cyberattacks on the computing systems of government agencies and major public corporations. We believe that, through the vision and direction of our team of experienced cybersecurity leaders, and with the guidance of our advisory boards, we will be able to develop cutting edge technologies and products to deal successfully with the continuously evolving threats of sophisticated hackers. Nevertheless, it is possible that our products could fail to perform as intended, with the result that our customers may experience cybersecurity breaches. If that were to happen, and depending on the scale of the breaches, we could suffer damage to our reputation for technical excellence, which may affect receptivity to our products, including products that were not implicated in a security breach.\nComputer and communications failures could lead to customer dissatisfaction.\nAs a provider of cyber products, we anticipate that it will be important to maintain reliable channels of electronic communications with our customers, for purposes of customer support, product access and diagnostics, and possibly, the secure hosting of customer data. If we experience periodic systems interruptions and infrastructure failures, or if our systems are subject to security breaches, this may cause customer dissatisfaction and may adversely affect the reputation for reliability of our products and services. We expect that the demands on our technological infrastructure will grow with our customer base, and we face the risk that, without continuing, and perhaps costly, investment, the reliability of our systems will not keep pace with the increasing demand.\nRisks Associated with Securities Litigation and Regulatory Matters\nA number of law firms have filed claims against the Company alleging violations of federal securities laws.\nA number of law firms have filed claims, or announced an intention to file, on behalf of stockholders of the Company alleging that the company has violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While the Company believes that there are no merits to claims that the Company violated applicable securities laws, the results of any investigation, or the outcome of any claims that may brought against us, if any, cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, regardless of the outcome, investigations can have an adverse impact on us because they may entail a significant amount of costs to defend the Company against any claims, such claims may negatively affect morale of employees and may divert the attention of management.\nThe Company has received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOn September 15, 2016, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting certain information from the Company. We have no indication or reason to believe that the Company is or will be the subject of any enforcement proceedings. The Company has publicly announced its receipt of the subpoena and is fully cooperating to comply with the SEC\u2019s request. Nevertheless, response to the subpoena may entail legal costs and the diversion of management\u2019s attention, and the issuance of the subpoena may create a perception of wrongdoing that could be harmful to our business.\nRisks Associated with Our Capital Requirements\nWe will need additional capital to fund our operations and to pursue acquisitions.\nAs discussed above, we expect to require additional financing through debt or equity financing in order to fund the development of our business for the foreseeable future. We may also require financing in order to fund acquisitions. We cannot be certain that such additional debt or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all, or that sales of our assets, if any, will be sufficient to enable us to accomplish our business objectives. If we cannot raise funds in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms, we will be unable to pursue our business plan.\nFuture issuance of equity may be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nIf the D-Vasive acquisition is consummated, we anticipate that we will be issuing to D-Vasive, Inc. approximately 43,800,000 shares of our common stock. This issuance was approved by stockholders at a meeting held on September 8, 2016. On April 3, 2017, the Company terminated the APA dated May 9, 2016, as amended on July 7, 2016, entered into by and among MGT, D-Vasive, the shareholders of D-Vasive and MGT Cybersecurity. The termination of the APA was premised on Section 3.4(b) of the APA which states that the APA may be terminated by either party thereto if the Closing contemplated thereunder did not occur on or before a specified date and the same is not otherwise extended by the parties, in writing or otherwise. Pursuant to the APA, as amended, MGT would have acquired certain technology and assets of D-Vasive if the Closing had occurred on the terms of the APA, as amended.\nWe may issue additional equity to raise cash for operations or to fund acquisitions, to provide equity based incentives to our management, employees and consultants or as consideration in acquisition transactions. Depending on the price at which such equity is issued, the issuances could be economically dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we issue substantial amounts of additional equity, the voting control of our existing stockholders will be meaningfully reduced irrespective of any economic dilution. Also, the board has the authority to issue preferred stock that may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of holders of our common stock. The Company anticipates that the board will not approve the issuance of additional equity unless the board determines, in the exercise of its business judgment, that the issuance is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Nevertheless, such issuances could have adverse consequences for stockholders and their interests in the Company.\nDebt that the Company raises in the future may place restrictions on the operational flexibility of the Company, and if convertible could be dilutive.\nThe Company does not currently contemplate issuing any substantial amount of debt. As the business of the Company matures, however, the Company could turn to the debt markets to raise additional capital. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt, we will be required to service that debt and are likely to become subject to restrictive covenants and other restrictions contained in the instruments governing that debt. This may limit our operational flexibility, by constraining our ability to issue additional debt, place liens on our assets, make distributions or engage in other capital transactions or asset sales. We may also issue convertible debt. If we do so, we anticipate that the conversion price would be at a premium to the market price at the time of issuance. At the time of conversion, however, the issuance of the additional equity could be dilutive to existing stockholders based upon the then current market price.\nRisks Associated with Intellectual Property\nThe protection of our intellectual property may be uncertain and we may face claims of others.\nAlthough we expect to receive patents with respect to certain aspects of our technology, we generally do not expect to rely on patent protection with respect to our products and technologies. Instead, we expect to rely primarily on a combination of trade secret and copyright law, employee and third party non-disclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect intellectual property rights pertaining to our products and technologies.\nSuch measures may not provide meaningful protection of our acquired technologies, trade secrets, know how or other intellectual property in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. Others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate our technologies. In addition, to the extent that we apply for any patents, such applications may not result in issued patents or, if issued, such patents may not be valid or of value. Third parties could, in the future, assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our current or future products and technologies, or we may need to assert claims of infringement against third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nMoreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate.\nWhile we have, and may in the future apply for copyright and trademark protection, we may not receive the protections that we desire or expect.\nWe expect that our marks and other forms of intellectual property that identify us with our products will be an important marketing tool and will create recognition for our brand of cybersecurity protection and related products. While we intend to make application to register this intellectual property in appropriate cases, no assurances can be given that any of the measures we undertake to protect and maintain these intellectual property assets and the associated goodwill. For example,\n\u25cf our applications for trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u25cf issued trademark and copyrights may not provide us with any competitive advantages versus potentially infringing parties;\n\u25cf our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or\n\u25cf our efforts may not prevent confusion with others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with ours.\nWe face risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement and we may have to defend our own intellectual property through litigation.\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet, application and software industries. Any infringement or misappropriation claim by us or against us could place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation. The costs of prosecuting or defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could adversely affect our business, even if we are ultimately successful in prosecuting or defending any such claims. If our products or technologies are found to infringe the rights of a third party, we could be required to pay significant damages or license fees or cease production, any of which could have material adverse effect on our business. If a claim is brought against us, or if we are unsuccessful on the claims on their merits, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nGeneral Business and Economic Risks\nFluctuating economic conditions will make it difficult to predict operating results in future periods.\nUncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Future or continued economic weakness for us or our customers, failure of our customers and target markets to recover from such weakness, customer financial difficulties, and reductions in spending on cybersecurity products could have a material adverse effect on demand for our technologies and products and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period.\nOur results of operations may vary as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\nchanges in the growth rate of the cybersecurity market, particularly the market for threat protection solutions like ours that target advanced cyber-attacks;\nthe timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape in the cybersecurity market, including consolidation among our customers or competitors;\nthe level of awareness of cybersecurity threats, particularly advanced cyber-attacks, and the market adoption of our technologies and products;\ndeferral of orders from customers in anticipation of new products or product enhancements announced by us or our competitors;\ndecisions by large scale potential customers such us corporations and organizations to purchase cybersecurity solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary cybersecurity equipment vendors;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nthe cost and potential outcomes of future litigation;\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestic and in our foreign markets;\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices; and\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business,\nThis variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our operating plan or the expectations of investors or analysts for any period. If we fail to meet such expectations for these or other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall.\nOther Risks\nAs we grow our business, including through contemplated acquisitions, we expect to experience significant strains on our management and operations.\nWe currently employ or have consulting arrangements with 8 personnel and occupy approximately 3,000 square feet of office space in Harrison, New York and Durham, North Carolina. Our plan is to grow substantially in the future, both through the development of our existing product offering and through acquisitions. To manage our growth successfully, we must continue to improve and expand our systems and infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner. We intend to make continuing investments in our infrastructure to support the growth of our business. We cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to do so, or that our controls, accounting and information systems, procedures and resources will be adequate to support a changing and growing company. If we cannot effectively meet the challenges of our growth, we will not be able to meet our business objectives and may have difficulty achieving profitability.\nThe Company is invested in bitcoin mining, but we cannot assure you that this aspect of our business will continue to be profitable or that we will determine to continue to maintain and invest in this business.\nThe Company currently has a 5.0 PH/s fully owned bitcoin facility which is hosted in Cashmere, Washington. The facility currently operates at a rate that is expected to generate approximately $100,000 of EBITDA each month, and the Company is in the process of doubling capacity with the recent purchase of more machines. Further plans to substantially increase operations in 2017 are contemplated.\nBitcoin mining by its nature over time requires increasing processing power, which in turn requires continuing investment in computer hardware and increasing power demands. We cannot assure you that the Company\u2019s bitcoin mining operations will remain profitable or say whether the Company will determine to continue to invest in these operations.\nMarket And Investment Risks\nGeneral Investment Risk\nYou could lose all of your investment.\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Potential investors should be aware that the value of an investment in the Company may go down as well as up. In addition, there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment in the Company will fully reflect its underlying value. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares will be able to be maintained. You could also lose your entire investment.\nRisks Associated with Our Stock Price\nThe Company\u2019s common stock has recently been delisted from the NYSE MKT.\nThe Company was previously listed on the NYSE MKT. On October 19, 2016, the Company received notice from the New York Stock Exchange stating that the staff of NYSE Regulation has determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company\u2019s common stock and that the trading of the Company\u2019s stock on the NYSE MKT was suspended. While the Company disputes the determination of the NYSE staff, the Company did not appeal the decision of NYSE Regulation. The Company\u2019s stock currently trades on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Markets LLC under the symbol \u201cMGTI.\u201d\nThe delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock from the NYSE MKT has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe Company is subject to the risks relating to penny stocks.\nTrading in our common stock is also subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally institutions. These additional requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in securities that are classified as penny stocks, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell such securities in the secondary market. A penny stock is defined generally as any non-exchange listed equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.\nOur stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in losses for our stockholders.\nThe equity markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition and could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock. We cannot predict the potential impact of these periods of volatility on the price of our common stock. The Company cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price and volume to decline.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, for example, in connection with the shares registered for sale herein, may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144 or registration for resale, or the conversion of preferred stock or exercise of warrants, circumstances commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d could result, in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could also make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nInvestor relations activities, nominal \u201cfloat\u201d and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our stock.\nThe Company may utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to create investor awareness for the Company. These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described. The Company may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third-parties based upon publicly-available information concerning the Company. The Company does not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts\u2019 reports or other materials based upon analysts\u2019 own research or methods. Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control. In addition, investors in the Company may, from time to time, also take steps to encourage investor awareness through similar activities that may be undertaken at their own expense. Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued, which may impact the trading market our common stock. Any of these activities could affect our stock price in a manner that is unrelated to the underlying value of our Company.\nOther Risks\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are authorized to issue an aggregate of 75,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, and stockholders in the future may approve an increase in the number of authorized shares. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. We will need to raise additional capital in the near future to meet our working capital needs, and we may have to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with these capital raising efforts, possibly at a price (or exercise or conversion prices) below the price an investor paid for stock.\nThe ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional stock may prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. See \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d in the section of this prospectus titled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d Shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of the Company. The ability of the board of directors to issue such additional shares of preferred stock, with such rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of the Company by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to the board of directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent officers and directors from office even if such removal would be favorable to stockholders generally.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends.", "PERMNO": 91050, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "MGTI"}
