The COVID-19 outbreak situation is very fluid and we continue to closely monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its ongoing impact on our business and operations, specifically:\n\u00b7Many regulators have mandated that insurers cover COVID-19 testing costs, and in some cases costs for related treatment and vaccines, as well as waiving any applicable deductible and coinsurance member payments. These mandates are primarily directed at major medical carriers, but a minority include STM insurance products. Attempts to extend these mandates beyond STM will likely not impact our supplemental products. Additionally, some states are requiring coverage for telehealth services. Mandated extended coverage of COVID-19 claims may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows and financial condition as such extended coverage was not contemplated in the initial product pricing. Even though we have experienced lower overall utilization for non-COVID related expenses within our STM block that is enough to absorb expected cost increases related to COVID related claims so far, this may change in the future depending on the further outcome of the virus impacts and other related regulatory actions.\n\u00b7Widespread unemployment due to the unprecedented state-mandated shutdowns of businesses could mean that policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our health, disability, life and pet policies. An increase in delayed, delinquent or non-collectable payments from customers may lead to cash flow volatility or shortfalls. Additionally, some regulators have mandated that insurers provide an extended grace period for premium collection and some require payment of claims during the grace period. Additional legal and regulatory responses include changes to insurance policy conditions such as suspension of cancellations and extensions of proof of loss deadlines. Some states have limited the impact to major medical insurance, while others have applied it to all policies in their states. These mandates may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results and cash flows.\n\u00b7The hiring and licensing by our marketing companies of sales agents who sell Medicare advantage and Medicare supplement as well as other products may be delayed, as many state regulators have limited licensing services. This may impact any future growth of the Company\u2019s call centers and career agents, and negatively impact expected sales of these products and our financial results.\n\u00b7Changes in utilization of medical facilities and services, medical expenses and other costs as a result of the impact of COVID-19 decrease the predictability of Medicare and Medicaid rates.\n\u00b7Slower growth in STM sales as policyholders focus on acquiring coverage under special enrollments for ACA policies may negatively impact our sales of such products and our operating results.\n\u00b7Higher unemployment could adversely affect our disability lines of business.\n\u00b7Continued mandatory shut down orders may cause smaller companies to go out of business, impacting our DBL and PFL lines.\n\u00b7Possible mandated coverages by regulators for other lines of business could adversely increase benefits with no increase in premiums.\n\u00b7Having our employees work from home could cause reductions in our operating effectiveness. Most of our employees continue to work remotely in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which may impair our ability to manage our business or exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal\ninformation or proprietary or confidential information about us, our members or other third parties. Further, we will incur additional expenses to allow employees to work remotely and to help expand the safety of our employees.\n\u00b7COVID-19 or any similar pandemic could increase mortality in our life products.\n\u00b7The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to significant volatility in financial markets, including declines in equity markets, changes in interest rates and overall reduced liquidity in the investment markets.\n\u00b7Our cost of reinsurance for policies many increase and/or we may have difficulty in finding reinsurance. Reinsurers may dispute, or seek to reduce or eliminate, coverage on policies as a result of any changes to policies or practices we make as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe extent of Covid-19\u2019s impact on our business and operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the transmission rate, duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, vaccine efficacy, the extent and effectiveness of the actions taken to contain the spread of the virus and address its impacts, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nOur loss reserves are based on an estimate of our future liability, and if actual claims prove to be greater than our reserves, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, where material, including legal and other fees, and costs not associated with specific claims but related to the claims payment functions for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot be sure that current reserves will prove adequate. If our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, we would have to augment our reserves and incur a charge to our earnings, and these charges could be material. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on our assessment of known facts and circumstances. Many factors could affect these reserves, including economic and social conditions, frequency and severity of claims, medical trends resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation, changes in utilization and demand for medical services, and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled and are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed.\nOur inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce our net income.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which we retain risk. If we fail to assess accurately the risks we retain, we may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and our reserves may be inadequate to cover our losses, requiring augmentation of the reserves, which in turn would reduce our net income.\nOur agreements with our producers that underwrite on our behalf require that each such producer follow underwriting guidelines published by us and amended from time to time.\nWe may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates because the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical, which could cause our results to fluctuate.\nThe insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted an increase in pricing and, thus, more favorable premium levels. An increase in premium levels is often, over time, offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance\ncapacity, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer opportunities to underwrite insurance risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe results of operations of our insurance business will decline if our premium rates are not adequate or if we are unable to increase rates.\nWe set the premium rates on our insurance policies based on facts and assumptions about numerous variables, including the actuarial probability of a policyholder incurring a claim, the probable size of the claim, maintenance costs to administer the policies and the interest rate earned on our investment of premiums. In setting premium rates, we consider historical claims information, industry statistics, the rates of our competitors and other factors, but we cannot predict with certainty the future actual claims on our products. If our actual claims experience proves to be less favorable than we assumed our financial results will be adversely affected. If we are unable to raise premium rates to the extent necessary to offset the unfavorable claims experience due to the cyclical insurance marked or regulatory restraints, our financial results will be adversely affected.\nFailures elsewhere in the insurance industry could obligate us to pay assessments through guaranty associations.\nVirtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in that state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies or to bear a portion of the cost of insurance for high-risk or uninsured individuals. When an insurance company becomes insolvent, state insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess other insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to pay obligations to policyholders of the insolvent company, up to the state-specific limit of coverage. Depending on state law, insurers can be assessed up to 2% of premium written for the relevant line of insurance in that state. The total amount of the assessment is based on the number of insured residents in each state, and each company\u2019s portion is based on its proportionate share of premium volume in the relevant lines of business.\nIf rating agencies downgrade our insurance companies, our results of operations and competitive position in the industry may suffer.\nRatings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance companies and our products, and our ability to market our products. Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American Insurance Company are all rated \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company, Inc. A.M. Best's ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to investors. The ratings of our carriers are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, and we cannot assure the continued maintenance of our current ratings.\nOur reliance upon third party administrators and other outsourcing arrangements may disrupt or adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend, and may in the future increase our dependence, on third parties for significant portions of our operations, including claims processing, premium billing, claims management, claims payment and voice communication services, and other systems-related support. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to the third parties' failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors. In the future, this dependence may increase as we may outsource additional areas of our business operations to additional vendors. There can be no assurance that any conversion or transition of business process functions from the Company to a vendor or between vendors will be seamless and these projects could result in significant operational challenges that cause financial difficulties. In addition, if our\nrelationships with our outsourcing partners are significantly disrupted or terminated for any reason or if the financial terms of such outsourcing partners change materially, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. A change in service providers, or a move of services from a third party to internal operations, could result in significant operational challenges, a decline in service quality and effectiveness, increased cost or less favorable contract terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our third party administrators, managing general agents, general agents or other producers exceed their authorities, otherwise breach obligations owed to us or commit fraud.\nIn connection with certain lines of business and insurance programs, we authorize third party administrators, managing general agents, general agents and other producers to write business and/or settle claims on our behalf within underwriting and claims settlement authorities prescribed by us. These parties pay claim amounts to the clients that have purchased insurance from us. If such an intermediary were to fail to pass such a payment through to the claimant or policyholder, we may remain liable for the deficiency because of applicable local laws or contractual obligations. Likewise, when a customer pays its policy premium to an agent or third party administrator for further remittance to us, that premium is generally considered to have been paid and the client is no longer liable for such amount even if we do not actually receive the premium. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with the intermediaries we use with respect to our insurance and reinsurance business. Further, we have less control and supervision over these underwriters and claims staff than our own employees and rely on the controls of our agents to write business within the underwriting authorities and settle claims within guidelines provided by us. Although we monitor our business on an ongoing basis, our monitoring efforts may not be adequate and our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach their obligations owed to us. To the extent that our agents exceed their authority, otherwise breach their obligations owed to us or commit fraud, this may result in a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations.\nReinsurers\u2019 failure to perform or adverse developments in the business retained may expose us to risks that we had sought to mitigate.\nWe utilize reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. Through reinsurance, we have the contractual right to collect the amount reinsured from our reinsurers. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. If we become liable for risks we have ceded to reinsurers or if our reinsurers cease to meet their obligations to us because they are insolvent or in a weakened financial position as a result of incurred losses or otherwise, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe retain most of the risk for our own account on some business underwritten by our insurance companies. The determination to not purchase reinsurance, or to reduce the amount of reinsurance we purchase, for a particular risk or line of business is based on a variety of factors including market conditions, pricing, availability of reinsurance, the level of our capital and our loss history. Such determinations have the effect of increasing our financial exposure to losses associated with such risks or in such lines of business and, in the event of significant losses associated with such risks or lines of business, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to maintain our existing and secure new relationships with strategic partners could harm our revenue and operating results.\nSome of our lines of business are dependent on a concentrated number of strategic partners and referral sources from whom we obtain leads to support sales of insurance policies. The loss of one or more of these strategic partners and lead suppliers could significantly limit our ability to access target markets.\nOur dependence on a concentrated number of strategic partners and third-party referral sources for new customers creates a risk that the termination of such relationship will lead to a significant reduction in revenues and revenue growth.\nAny inability to secure, maintain or effectively manage relationship with strategic partners could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. Further, a material reduction of new referrals from any of our significant referral sources would harm our financial results.\nWe may be unsuccessful in competing against larger or better-established business rivals.\nWe compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. We face competition from specialty insurance companies, and from diversified financial services companies and insurance companies that are much larger than we are and that have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. Some of these competitors also have greater experience, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and more market recognition than we do in certain lines of business. In addition, some of our competitors may seek to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances. These consolidated entities and alliances may use their enhanced market power and broader capital base to take business from us or to drive down pricing, which could adversely affect the results of our operations. Failure to compete effectively against current or future competitors could result in loss of current or potential customers, which could adversely affect pricing, lower revenue, prevent us from maintaining profitability and diminish brand strength. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we operate, or that we will be able to expand operations into new markets. If we fail to do so, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our continued efforts to execute on our strategies to diversify sources of income.\nWe have devoted significant effort and financial resources to build new products, distribution and service capabilities to diversify our product portfolio. We aim to continue implementing our strategies while maintaining current positions of strength in our existing businesses, as well as maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. Our success will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to achieve name recognition, accurately predict market trends, differentiate our product offerings from our competitors\u2019 products, provide excellent customer service, attract and retain skilled employees, maintain comprehensive focus on all company priorities, develop new products in a timely manner and achieve market acceptance, effectively implement new technology and operational platforms, deepen our existing distribution relationships and add new distribution partners, and set appropriate prices for our products. If we do not successfully build brand awareness and grow market share, the business could stagnate or be adversely affected, which would harm operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nWe have recently experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant growth, which has stressed operations, infrastructure and financial systems, and may also result in increased costs. If we do not effectively manage growth at any time, our financial condition could be harmed and the quality of our services could suffer. Furthermore, in order to successfully expand our business, we need to hire, integrate and retain highly skilled and motivated employees and continue to improve our existing systems for operational and financial management. These improvements could require significant capital expenditures\nand place increasing demands on our management. If we do not successfully implement improvements in these areas, our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nIn connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies, we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the entry into new lines of business, the integration of acquired businesses and the growth and development of these businesses.\nIn pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent in researching it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. In addition, if we are not able to improve, refine or revise our systems and operational practices to integrate the acquisition, and enlarge the scale and scope of our business, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.\nThe failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems and to safeguard the security of our data could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer systems, and we have different information systems for our various businesses. We rely on these systems to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for writing business, to provide insurance quotes, to process our premiums and policies, to administer our products, to process and make claims payments, to establish our loss reserves, and to prepare our management and external financial statements and information. The failure of these systems could interrupt our operation and we could experience adverse consequences, including: (i) inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserving decisions; (ii) inadequate information for accurate financial reporting; (iii) increases in administrative expenses; (iv) the loss of existing customers or key distributors; (v) difficulty in attracting new customers or distributors; (vi) an inability to comply with regulations or customer or vendor expectations, such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; (vii) customer, provider and agent disputes; and (viii) litigation or regulatory enforcement exposure.\nOur database and systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from system outages, disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, acts of terrorism, blackouts, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events, which would compromise our ability to conduct business. In the event of such failures, we may be unable to perform critical functions in a timely manner, and our systems may not be available to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. Any such interruptions may reduce our revenues or increase our expenses, and may also have an adverse impact upon our reputation, distribution partnerships, or our customer or vendor relationships. Such an occurrence may also impair our ability to timely and accurately complete our financial reporting and other regulatory obligations and may impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We also utilize and/or rely on computer systems developed and maintained by outsourcing relationships and key vendors. Their systems could experience the same risks, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results.\nWe have committed and will continue to commit significant resources to develop, maintain and enhance our existing information systems, transition existing systems to upgraded systems, and develop\nnew information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. Advances in technology that may render our current information technology systems obsolete will require upgrading and maintenance over time, which may require significant future commitments of resources and capital. If we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws and respond to emerging security threats and potential security incidents, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial positions and cash flows could be materially affected.\nOur computer systems have been, and will continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, acts of vandalism, theft, misuse, cyber-attacks, hackers, corruption and destruction of data maintained online or digitally, and other computer-related penetrations. For instance, cyber-attacks may interfere with our processing of transactions including: (i) the processing of orders from our website; (ii) cause the release and possible destruction of confidential customer or business information; (iii) impede application processing; (iv) subject us and/or our service providers and intermediaries to regulatory fines and financial losses; and/or (v) cause reputational damage. Such threats require additional layers of security, which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. We commit significant resources to administrative and technical controls to prevent cyber incidents and protect our information technology, but our preventative actions to reduce the risk of cyber threats may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service and other cyber-attacks or security breaches. Such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties, with whom we interact, impede or interrupt business operations and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, disruption of our operations, additional regulatory scrutiny, sanctions (such as penalties, fines and loss of license) and litigation, and reputational damage.\nAdditionally, past or future negligence or misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors or suppliers could result in misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, violations of laws by us, regulatory sanctions against us and/or serious reputational, legal or financial harm to our business, and the precautions we employ to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor the business decisions and activities of these individuals to prevent us from engaging in inappropriate activities, excessive risk taking, fraud or security breaches, these individuals may take such risks regardless of such controls and procedures and such controls and procedures may fail to detect all such decisions and activities. We review our compensation policies and procedures as part of our overall risk management program, but it is possible that such compensation policies and practices could inadvertently incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk taking. If these individuals take excessive or inappropriate risks, those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to safeguard the security of our data and protect our customers\u2019 confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business and expose us to substantial liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue and other damages.\nIn the conduct of our business, we are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations. Our business depends on our clients\u2019 and customers\u2019 willingness to entrust us with their sensitive personal information. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state and industry levels. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our health insurance operations is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and certain other activities we conduct, are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. HIPAA also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. In addition,\nwe also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors, partners and policyholders. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information, and in some instances may impose indemnity obligations on us relating to unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of any such information.\nDespite the implementation of network security measures, our computer systems may be vulnerable to physical and electronic break-ins, computer viruses or malware, programming errors, attacks by third parties, unauthorized access, tampering, cyber-attacks, and other computer-related penetrations and similar disruptive problems. A breach of cybersecurity could compromise our confidential information, including personal identifiable information of our customers and employees, and information related to third parties with whom we interact. A person who is able to circumvent these security measures and penetrate our and our subsidiaries\u2019 computer systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete any information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. There have been large scale cyber-attacks and other cyber-security breaches within the insurance industry. As we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally, our exposure to data security and related cyber-security risks increases, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage, loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases. In addition, while we review and assess the cybersecurity controls of our third party providers to whom we outsource certain services, as appropriate, and make changes to our business processes to manage these risks, such third parties and, in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to the same type of security breaches. If we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information and there is inappropriate access, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, such as civil and criminal liability, penalties, fines and loss of license, as well as possible litigation. In addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. This could also have an adverse impact on our image or customer relationships and, therefore, result in loss of distribution partners, lower sales, lapses of existing business, or increased expenses. We purchase cyber risk insurance and assess the adequacy of this insurance annually, but this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our losses from breaches of our data.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.\nWe have developed an enterprise-wide risk management and governance framework to mitigate risk and loss to the Company. We maintain policies, procedures and controls intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the risks to which we are exposed. However, our enterprise risk management policies and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive and may not identify every risk to which we are exposed. There are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. We cannot provide assurance that our risk management framework, including the underlying assumptions or strategies, will be accurate and effective.\nWe have risks from exiting the individual life and annuities business.\nWe exited the individual life and annuities business in July 2015 when our subsidiaries, Madison National Life and Standard Security Life, closed on an agreement to coinsure substantially all of their run-off blocks of individual life and annuities and sold Madison National Life's infrastructure related to those blocks, to National Guardian Life Insurance Company (\u201cNGL\u201d). If NGL defaults on its reinsurance commitments and/or its administration commitments, then the policies may come back to us. Since we have sold our infrastructure, we would not have the ability to administer the business because we no longer have the IT systems or staff to support the business. We may have to incur expenses to rebuild our\ncapabilities and for regulatory and other legal actions, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have risks from the Paid Family Leave Risk Adjustment Program.\nBeginning January 1, 2018, a rider was added to all DBL policies adding benefits for PFL. This rider is mandated by the NYSDFS. The PFL premium rate charged is set by the NYSDFS. In addition to mandating this benefit, the NYSDFS established a risk adjustment program so that all carriers would share on a pro rata basis in the ultimate profit or loss of the PFL business across three group sizes for the entire industry. The goal of the PFL risk adjustment program is to protect issuers from disproportionate adverse or favorable risks that might arise because PFL premium rates are community rated and not allowed to vary by risk factors.\nSince the NYSDFS established a risk adjustment program, the Company is required to record in its financial statements an accrual for a potential payment to, or recovery from, the risk adjustment program depending on how its loss ratio compares to the industry wide loss ratio. To determine the amount of this risk adjustment, knowledge of industry wide performance is necessary. The NYSDFS does not share the industry loss ratio data for the current reporting year until the following year. However, the Company uses unaudited industry available information to make its best estimate of its potential payment under the risk adjustment program until actual information is available.\nWe cannot predict the full effect of the risk adjustment program on the Company at this time, but it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nEconomic, governmental and competitive factors, and changes in societal attitudes such as work ethic, motivation or stability, can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products.\nGroup life and disability insurance may also be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured, the amount of insurance employees may elect voluntarily, our risk selection process, our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics, the geographical concentration of employees, and mortality rates. Claim incidence may also be influenced by unexpected catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and pandemic health events, which may also affect the cost of and availability of reinsurance coverage. Although pricing and renewal actions can be taken in reaction to higher claim rates, these actions take time to implement, and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices. In addition, changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time. It is difficult to predict how the above factors will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to grow our pet insurance customer base and maintain high retention rates, our growth prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow the pet insurance business depends on expanding and retaining our customer base. We are focused primarily on expanding market share, and our primary competitive challenge is to educate pet owners as to the need for pet insurance and what makes our products attractive. The promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial investments, and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, the acquisition of leads and policyholders may become increasingly more expensive. We have made and will to continue to make substantial investments in enrollment functionality of our websites (www.mypetinsurance.com, www.petplace.com, www.petpartners.com and www.AKCpetinsurance.com), our TailTrax app, the education of our sales and service staff, and activities that generate traffic to our web properties, increase customer engagement and enhance the customer experience. If the expenses that we incur in connection with these activities do not result in sufficient growth\nin customers to offset the cost, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nObtaining quality insurance sales leads is important to our pet business, but our ability to convert leads to policy sales is also a key success factor. Many factors impact conversion rate, including lead quality. If lead quality diminishes, conversion rates will be adversely affected. If competition for customers increases, our conversion rates may decline, even absent a degradation in lead quality. If our conversion rate does not meet expectations, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur pet insurance business may be affected by changes in the economic environment as it is deemed by many to be discretionary. Pet owners may reduce or eliminate discretionary spending during an economic downturn, resulting in an increase in terminations, a material reduction in retention rate, and a reduction in the number of new policyholders. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition may be significantly affected by changes in the economic environment.\nMarket and Financial Risks\nOur investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses. In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may greatly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio. Further, the value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the preferred stocks and bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the continued recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.\nIn particular, at December 31, 2020, fixed maturities represented $406.6 million or 85.9% of our total investments of $473.6 million. The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions and generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates. The impact of value fluctuations affects our Consolidated Financial Statements. Because all of our fixed maturities are classified as available for sale, changes in the fair value of our securities are reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss). No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income (loss) and/or cash flows. For mortgage-backed securities, credit risk exists if mortgagees default on the underlying mortgages. Although, at December 31, 2020, 99.5% of the Company\u2019s fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average AA, all of the fixed maturities are subject to credit risk. If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value). In a worst-case scenario, the issuer could default on its payment or performance of its obligations, which could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the continued recognition of investment losses associated with the impairment of the securities.\nWe regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that are other-than-temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion, properly valued and any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and rating of the\nissuer, whether any collateral is held and the Company's intent to sell, or be required to sell, debt securities before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis. However, the determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Therefore, changes in facts and circumstances and critical assumptions could result in management\u2019s decision that further impairments have occurred. This could lead to additional losses on investments, particularly those that management has the intent and ability to hold until recovery in value occurs.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.\nPrior to the U.S. presidential election, President Biden provided some informal guidance on what tax law changes he would support. Among other things, President Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28% and a new alternative minimum tax on book income. If enacted, the Company\u2019s effective tax rate could materially change as a result of changes in tax laws. If President Biden\u2019s proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate. The impact of current and future fiscal policy changes are unknown and could affect our business and financial condition.\nOur earnings could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill.\nGoodwill represented $74.9 million of our $1.1 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2020. We review our goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include: a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in the business climate; and/or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in one of these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. If indicators of impairment exist, we may incur a material non-cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nOur operating results will be impacted by factors that impact our estimate of the constrained lifetime value of commissions revenue per approved member.\nWe recognize revenue for certain non-IHC carrier products policies that we have issued since January 1, 2020 based upon the total expected commissions we expect to receive over the life of the underlying polices, net of a constraint. We recognize commission revenue at the time the application for the policy is issued by the carrier equal to the estimated commissions we expect to collect over the lifetime of the policy. The constrained lifetime value (\u201cLTV\u201d) for each product line is an estimate and is based on a number of assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, estimated product duration related to member cancellation timing, forecasted commission amounts we expect to receive per issued member, carrier mix, the regulatory environment, and cancellations of insurance products offered by our carrier partners with which we have a relationship. These assumptions incorporate management\u2019s judgment.\nAs we continue to evaluate our LTV estimation models, we may in the future make further changes based on a number of factors and such changes could result in increases or decreases in our revenue. These assumptions are based on historical trends and require significant judgment by our management in interpreting those trends and in applying the constraints. Changes in our historical trends will result in changes to our constrained LTV estimates in future periods and therefore could adversely affect our revenue and financial results in those future periods. As a result, negative changes in the factors upon which we estimate constrained LTVs, increased health insurance policy termination or a reduction in the lifetime commission amounts we expect to receive for selling the product to a member or other changes could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if we ultimately receive commission\npayments that are less than the amount we estimated when we recognized commission revenue, we would need to write off the remaining commission receivable balance, which would adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe forecasted average product duration is a significant factor in our estimation of constrained LTV. We receive commissions when we place health insurance policies with carriers with whom we are contracted to represent. When the member terminates coverage, or if we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy, we no longer receive the related commission payment. Our forecasted average product duration and health insurance policy termination rate are calculated based on our historical data by product and distribution type. As a result, our inability to produce accurate forecasted average product and distribution type duration may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCommission rates are a part of the significant factors in our estimation of constrained LTVs. The commission rates we receive are impacted by a variety of factors, including the particular health insurance products chosen by our members, the carriers offering those policies, our members\u2019 state of residence, the laws and regulations in those jurisdictions, the average premiums of policies purchased through us and health care reform at the state and federal levels. Our commission revenue per member could decrease in the future as a result of reductions in contractual commission rates, the loss of a major carrier contract, a change in the mix of carriers whose products we sell during a given period, and increased health insurance policy termination rates, all of which are beyond our control and may occur on short notice. To the extent these and other factors cause our commission revenue per member to decline, our revenue may decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in regulation, or the application thereof, may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nLegislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. Further, state insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations or in interpretations or enforcement thereof, enactment of new laws or regulations, or new judicial decisions affecting the insurance industry, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our business. Such changes to insurance laws or regulations, or new insurance laws and regulations, may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and could significantly increase our compliance costs. We cannot predict what impact, if any, the results of these studies or other such proposals, if enacted, may have on our financial condition, results of operations, prospects for growth and cash flows. If we were unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the full effect of these or any other regulatory initiatives on the Company at this time, but they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nChanges to health insurance laws may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough health insurance is generally regulated at the state level, actions at the federal level have affected and will likely continue to affect our business. Since the ACA became law in March 2010, it has caused sweeping and fundamental changes to the U.S. health care and health insurance industries. We anticipate that the Biden Administration will work to strengthen the ACA. We will continue to monitor efforts to strengthen the ACA and reassess our business strategies accordingly. We will also monitor the changes proposed by the Biden administration to determine the expected timing of any changes and how\nthey will impact us. The nature of the changes that this administration will bring both to the ACA and ancillary markets is not known, so we are unable to predict what additional health insurance requirements, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities. To the extent known, we have made, and are continuing to make, significant changes to our operations, products and strategy to adapt to the new environment. However, if our plans for operating in the new environment are unsuccessful or are less successful than our competitors, or if there is less demand than we expect for our products in the new environment, our results could be adversely affected.\nThe ACA also affects us as an employer because it significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the United States. The ACA may impact our cost of providing our employees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business. We are continually assessing the impact of the ACA on our health care benefit costs.\nStates may adopt new laws for pet insurance that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe NAIC may draft model laws that focuses on insurance for pets. States may enact new laws to adopt what the NAIC drafts, or a state may enact its own new laws or regulations that could affect our industry. Many states have considered and may continue to consider proposed legislation that could significantly affect our operations, including, for example, our ability to effect rate increases, to cancel or not issue existing policies, or how to market our product. Implementing changes in order to comply with new laws or regulations could also be time-consuming and costly.\nLegal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\nWe face a risk of litigation in the ordinary course of operating our business, including the risk of class actions, regulatory actions and individual lawsuits relating, among other things, to sales or underwriting practices, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, claims payments and procedures, marketing, product design, disclosure, administration, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, interest crediting practices, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. Adverse judgments in one or more of such lawsuits could require us to pay significant damage amounts or to change aspects of our operations. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Further, industry trends, such as increased litigation against the insurance industry and individual insurers, the willingness of courts to expand covered causes of loss and the size of awards, rising jury awards, escalating medical costs, and increasing loss severity may render the loss reserves of our insurance subsidiaries inadequate for current and future losses. The unpredictability of court decisions in the insurance business could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows. In addition, the political divisiveness leading, in some cases, to the stalling of the legislative process, may cause judicial activism and result in rulings concerning our products, the way we sell our products, and the profitability of our products, which may result in greater differences in the regulatory approaches of the states.\nWe are also subject to various regulatory examinations, actions, inquiries and proceedings, such as information requests, subpoenas, market conduct exams and books and record examinations, from state and federal regulators and other authorities in the ordinary course of our business. Our subsidiaries, Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American Insurance Company, have been selected for a multistate market conduct exam (\u201cMCE\u201d), related to our STM, limited medical and fixed indemnity health insurance products for the period of January 1, 2014 through September 30, 2017. In an effort to avoid long-term litigation and/or administrative proceedings that would be required to resolve disputes between the three subsidiaries and the states involved in the MCE, the 5 lead states and the three subsidiaries entered into separate Regulatory Settlement Agreements (\"RSAs\") on July 14, 2020. The 37 participating\nstates have adopted the RSAs. The Company accrued $3,660,000 in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet in the second quarter and processed payment in October. The Company is also implementing a compliance plan. Furthermore, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting new investigations or proceedings could result in new legal actions or precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could adversely affect our business. Even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, any such action or proceeding could significantly injure our reputation, cause negative publicity, adversely affect our financial strength ratings, place us at a competitive disadvantage in marketing or administering our products, or impair our ability to sell or retain insurance policies, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with extensive state and federal regulations, we will be subject to penalties, which may include fines and suspension and which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA large portion of our business depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Some states have imposed time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were unable, for any reason, to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our business depends on our ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for our operations. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, revoke or deny licenses and approvals. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations, or interpretations that we believe to be generally followed by the industry, which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals and do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our insurance-related activities or otherwise penalize us. That type of action could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not receive approval for changes to an existing product, for a proposed new product or for pricing changes, or we may not receive such approvals in a timely manner.\nStates require licensure and regulatory approval prior to marketing new insurance products or changing premiums for existing products. From time to time, we seek updates to our existing products. We may also introduce new products which make changes that are more extensive to the product approved in a state. We may reevaluate and seek changes to product pricing, subject to the review and approval of the state regulators, who may reduce or disallow pricing changes. Such review has in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in delayed implementation of pricing changes and prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to achieve targeted profitability, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. A delayed approval may require us to raise rates more quickly than we otherwise may desire. This could tarnish our reputation with new and/or existing customers and reduce retention rates, which could significantly damage our brand, result in the loss of expected revenue and otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe failure to comply with rules and regulations regarding the protection of our customers\u2019 confidential information and privacy could expose us to substantial liability.\nThe NAIC has adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which, if adopted by a state will require insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to comply with certain requirements under state insurance laws, such as developing and maintaining a written information security program, conducting risk assessments and overseeing the data security practices of third-party vendors. The purpose of the model law is to establish standards for data security\nand for the investigation and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information. Certain states have adopted the model law, and we expect that additional states will begin adopting the model law, although it cannot be predicted whether or not, or in what form or when, they will do so. We are currently evaluating these regulations and their potential impact on our operations. In addition, certain state insurance regulators are developing or have developed regulations that may impose regulatory requirements relating to cybersecurity on insurance and reinsurance companies (potentially including insurance and reinsurance companies that are not domiciled, but are licensed, in the relevant state). For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services has adopted a regulation pertaining to cybersecurity for all banking, insurance entities and other financial services institutions under its jurisdiction, effective as of March 1, 2017, that requires them to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program \u201cdesigned to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State's financial services industry.\u201d We have established a cybersecurity program in place outlining our policies and procedures for the protection of our information systems and information stored on those systems that comports with the regulation and continue to evaluate this regulation and its potential impact on our operations, but depending on its implementation, we may be required to incur significant expense in order to meet its requirements. We expect cybersecurity risk management, prioritization and reporting to continue to be an area of significant focus by governments, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations at all levels.", "PERMNO": 43837, "SIC": 6321, "TIC": "IHC"}
