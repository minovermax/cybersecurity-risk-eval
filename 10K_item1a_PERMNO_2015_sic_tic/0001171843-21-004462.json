{"cik": "1444192", "company": "Acasti Pharma Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nAny investment in our common Shares involves a high degree of risk. The following risk factors and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be carefully considered. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected, and you could lose all or a part of the value of your investment. Additional risks or uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we deem immaterial, may also negatively affect our business operations.\nIn addition, on May 7, 2021, Acasti entered into a merger agreement with Grace, pursuant to which, subject to the approval of Acasti shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Grace would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acasti, referred to herein as the merger.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe equity exchange ratio will not be adjusted in the event of any change in Acasti's share price.\nIf the merger is completed, at the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Grace common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive a number of Acasti common shares per share of Grace common stock equal to the equity exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement such that, immediately following the consummation of the merger, existing Acasti shareholders are expected to own at least 55% and existing Grace stockholders are expected to own at most 45% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis. The equity exchange ratio is subject to upward adjustment in favor of Acasti shareholders based on each company\u2019s capitalization and net cash balance at the effective time of the merger, as specified in the merger agreement. For more information on the equity exchange ratio, see the merger agreement filed as exhibit 2.1 to this annual. The equity exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Acasti common shares. As a result, changes in the price of Acasti common shares prior to completion of the merger will affect the market value of the share considerations that Grace stockholders will receive in the merger. Changes in the Acasti common share price may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond Acasti\u2019s control), including the following:\n\u2022 changes in Acasti\u2019s and Grace\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, or the market assessments thereof;\n\u2022 market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed; and\n\u2022 general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the price of Acasti common shares.\nThe price of Acasti common shares at the closing of the merger may vary from the price on the date the merger agreement was executed, the date of this annual report and the date of the annual and special meeting of Acasti shareholders. As a result, the market value of the merged entity will also vary. For example, based on the range of closing prices of Acasti common shares during the period from May 6, 2021, which was the last trading day before the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, through June 18, 2021, the estimated equity exchange ratio represented a market value ranging from a low of approximately $2.47 to a high of approximately $3.07 for each share of Grace common stock.\nBecause the merger will be completed after the date of the Acasti annual and special shareholders meeting and the Grace stockholder approval, you will not know, at the time of the Acasti annual and special shareholder meeting or the Grace stockholder approval, the market value of the Acasti common shares that Grace stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger.\nIf the price of Acasti common shares increases between the time of the Acasti annual and special meeting or the Grace stockholder approval and the time at which Acasti common shares are distributed to Grace stockholders following completion of the merger, Grace stockholders will receive Acasti common shares that have a market value that is greater than the market value of such shares at the time of the Acasti annual and special meeting or the Grace stockholder approval. Conversely, if the price of Acasti common shares decreases between the time of the Acasti annual and special meeting or Grace stockholder approval and the time at which Acasti common shares are distributed to Grace stockholders following completion of the merger, Grace stockholders will receive Acasti common shares that have a market value that is less than the market value of such shares at the time of the Acasti annual and special meeting or the Grace stockholder approval. Therefore, Grace stockholders and Acasti shareholders will not have certainty at the time of the Acasti annual and special meeting or the Grace stockholder approval of the market value of the consideration that will be paid to Grace stockholders upon completion of the merger.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact the share prices and the future business and financial results of Acasti.\nIf the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Acasti may be adversely affected. Additionally, if the merger is not completed and the merger agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, either Acasti or Grace may be required to pay to the other a termination fee of $1,000,000 including any reimbursement the other party\u2019s expenses up to a maximum of $500,000. Even if a termination fee or expenses of the other party are not payable in connection with a termination of the merger agreement, Acasti has incurred significant transaction expenses in connection with the merger regardless of whether the merger is completed. The foregoing risks, or other risks arising in connection with the failure of the merger, including the diversion of management attention from conducting the business of Acasti and pursuing other opportunities during the pendency of the merger, may have an adverse effect on the business, operations, and financial results of Acasti as well the price of Acasti common shares. In addition, Acasti could be subject to litigation related to any failure to consummate the merger transaction or any related action that could be brought to enforce a party\u2019s obligations under the merger agreement.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of either Acasti or Grace.\nThe merger agreement contains \u201cno shop\u201d provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict Acasti\u2019s and Grace\u2019s ability to solicit, encourage, facilitate, or discuss competing third party proposals to acquire shares or assets of Acasti or Grace. In specified circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Acasti or Grace will be required to pay the termination fee to the other party. In the event that either Acasti or Grace receives an alternative acquisition proposal, the other party has the right to propose changes to the terms of the merger agreement before the Acasti or Grace board of directors may withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the merger and related transactions.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Acasti from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in specified circumstances. Acasti\u2019s and Grace\u2019s right to match specified alternative acquisition proposals with respect to the other party could also discourage potential competing acquirers from considering or proposing that acquisition.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated and Acasti determines to seek another transaction, it may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger.\nThe merger may be completed even though certain events occur prior to the closing that materially and adversely affect Acasti or Grace.\nThe merger agreement provides that either Acasti or Grace can refuse to complete the merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party prior to the closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Acasti or Grace, including, among others:\n\u00b7 changes, developments or conditions in or relating to general international, political, economic or financial or capital market conditions, or political, economic or financial or capital market conditions in any jurisdiction in which Acasti and Grace operate or carry on business;\n\u00b7 changes, developments or conditions resulting from any act of sabotage or terrorism or any outbreak of hostilities or declared or undeclared war, or any escalation or worsening of such acts of sabotage, terrorism, hostilities or war;\n\u00b7 any natural disaster;\n\u00b7 changes or developments in or relating to currency exchange or interest rates;\n\u00b7 changes or developments affecting the pharmaceutical industry in general;\n\u00b7 any change in applicable laws (other than orders against a party or a subsidiary thereof) or U.S. GAAP;\n\u00b7 except for purposes of representations regarding required approvals in connection with the merger and the absence of violations of law, the parties' respective constating documents or material contracts of the parties or changes in permits held by the parties as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby;\n\u00b7 any actions taken (or omitted to be taken) by Acasti or Grace upon the express written request of the other;\n\u00b7 any changes in the share price or trading volume of Acasti common shares or any failure of Grace to meet projections, guidance, milestones, forecasts or published financial or operating predictions or measures (it being agreed that the facts and circumstances giving rise to any of the foregoing events or failures, unless expressly excluded, may be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred);\n\u00b7 the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemic or pandemic outbreaks including any continuation or worsening thereof; or\n\u00b7 a share consolidation of Acasti.\nIf an adverse change occurs and Acasti and Grace still complete the merger, the business, operations or prospects of the combined company, or the market price of its common shares, may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value received by the shareholders of Acasti in connection with the merger.\nIf the conditions to the merger are not satisfied or waived, the merger may not occur. If the merger is consummated, it will result in substantial dilution to Acasti shareholders and may not deliver the anticipated benefits Acasti expects.\nEven if the merger is approved by the shareholders of Acasti and the stockholders of Grace, specified other conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger. These conditions are set forth in the merger agreement filed as exhibit 2.1 to this annual report. Acasti cannot assure you that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived. Certain of the closing conditions are legally incapable of being waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger may not occur or will be delayed, and Acasti may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger. If consummated, the merger will result in dilution to Acasti\u2019s shareholders and could result in other restrictions that may affect its business. Further, if completed, the merger ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value.\nThe combined company may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm the combined company\u2019s business and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nIn the past, securities class action or shareholder derivative litigation often follows certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or announcement of a merger. The combined company may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business.\nAcasti has received notice from Nasdaq of non-compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nOn May 11, 2021, Acasti received written notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department notifying Acasti that based upon Acasti\u2019s non-compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a) as of May 10, 2021, Acasti securities were subject to delisting unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel.\nAcasti requested a hearing, which stayed any further action by Nasdaq pending the conclusion of the hearing process.\nAt the hearing, on June 17, 2021, Acasti presented a detailed plan of compliance for the Nasdaq Listing Panel\u2019s consideration, which included Acasti\u2019s commitment to implement a share consolidation if needed to evidence compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. Acasti expects to receive the Nasdaq Listing Panel\u2019s decision 30 days after the hearing date. There can be no assurance that Nasdaq will accept Acasti\u2019s plan or that Acasti will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq requirement in the future. The approval by Nasdaq of (i) the continued listing of Acasti\u2019s common shares on Nasdaq following the effective time and (ii) the listing of the Acasti common shares being issued in connection with the merger on Nasdaq at or prior to the effective time are conditions to the closing of the merger.\nWe may be subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, many of our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, including Canadian dollars. As we previously completed financings in both Canadian and U.S. dollars, both currencies are maintained and used to make required payments in the applicable currency. Though we plan to implement measures designed to reduce our foreign exchange rate exposure, the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar /European euro exchange rates have fluctuated significantly in the recent past and may continue to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may not realize any additional value in a strategic transaction for our intellectual property.\nThe market capitalization of our corporation is or may be below the value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the time of consummation of any strategic transaction. Although the CaPre clinical trial failed to meet its primary endpoints, we believe that data from preclinical and other clinical studies of CaPre may support potential further investigation and development activities. However, potential counterparties in a strategic transaction involving our corporation may place minimal or no value on our assets, given the limited data regarding their potential application. Further, the development and any potential commercialization of investigational CaPre will require substantial additional funding associated with conducting the necessary clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval. Consequently, any potential counterparty in a strategic transaction involving our corporation may choose not to spend additional resources and continue development of CaPre and may attribute little or no value, in such a transaction, to CaPre or our other intellectual property.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights.\nIt is possible that our patents and/or proprietary technologies in the future could be circumvented through the adoption of competitive, though non-infringing, processes or products. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowable or enforceable in our patents, or of patents licensed to us.\nWe face risks that:\n\u00b7 our rights under our U.S., Canadian or foreign patents or other licensed patents that other third parties license to us could be curtailed;\n\u00b7 we may not be the first inventor of inventions covered by our issued patents or pending applications or be the first to file patent applications for those inventions;\n\u00b7 our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by us, or be issued at all;\n\u00b7 our competitors could independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies;\n\u00b7 our trade secrets could be learned independently by our competitors;\n\u00b7 the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate; and\n\u00b7 effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not sought by us in some foreign countries.\nFurther, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, a patent generally expires 20 years after it is filed (or 20 years after the filing date of the first non-provisional U.S. patent application to which it claims priority). While extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Further, the extensive period of time between patent filing and regulatory approval for a product candidate limits the time during which we can market that product candidate under patent protection. Patents owned by third parties could have priority over patent applications filed or in-licensed by us, or we or our licensors could become involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before U.S., Canadian or foreign patent offices. The cost of defending and enforcing our patent rights against infringement charges by other patent holders may be significant and could limit our operations.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. If we or our licensors were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our or our licensor\u2019s patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements; for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the patent office, such as the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we or our licensors and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common shares.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect product candidates.\nNumerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the various patent offices around the world may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. These changes may lead to increasing uncertainty with regard to the scope and value of our issued patents and to our ability to obtain patents in the future.\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification derivation and opposition proceedings in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against the initial grant. In the course of any such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims attacked or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether. Depending on decisions by authorities in various jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares\nThe price of our common shares may be volatile.\nMarket prices for pharmaceutical companies can fluctuate significantly. Factors such as the announcement to the public or in various scientific or industry forums of technological innovations; new commercial products; patents or exclusive rights obtained by us or others; disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; the commencement, enrollment or announcement of results of clinical trials we conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates; results or delays of pre-clinical and clinical studies by us or others; any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings; a change of regulations; additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; overall performance of the equity markets; general political and economic conditions; publications; failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public; research reports or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors; public concerns over the risks of pharmaceutical products and dietary supplements; unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates; the ability to finance, future sales of securities by us or our shareholders; and many other factors, many of which are beyond our control, could have considerable effects on the price of our common shares. The price of our common shares has fluctuated significantly in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price of our common shares will not experience significant fluctuations in the future.\nIn addition, pharmaceutical companies often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against pharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in order to execute on our business plan. We may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness by us would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us.\nThe market price of our common shares could decline as a result of operating results falling below the expectations of investors or fluctuations in operating results each quarter.\nOur net losses and expenses may fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial or clinical expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in the price of our common shares. Our net losses and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future. The market price of our common shares has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so. Some of the factors that could cause the market price for our common shares to fluctuate include the following:\n\u00b7 the fluctuations in valuation of our derivative warrant liabilities;\n\u00b7 the outcome of any litigation;\n\u00b7 changes in foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7 competition;\n\u00b7 the timing of achievement and the receipt of milestone payments from current or future third parties;\n\u00b7 failure to enter into new or the expiration or termination of current agreements with third parties;\n\u00b7 execution of any new collaboration, licensing or similar arrangement, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under such existing or future arrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;\n\u00b7 any intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition against us or our competition that could have a negative impact on or any proceedings in which we may become involved;\n\u00b7 additions and departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u00b7 inability to achieve strategic outcome from review of strategic alternatives; and\n\u00b7 changes in general market and economic conditions.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our common shares could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nThere can be no assurance that an active market for our common shares will be sustained.\nThere can be no assurance that an active market for our common shares will be sustained. Holders of common shares may be unable to sell their investments on satisfactory terms. As a result of any risk factor discussed herein, the market price of our common shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long-term value. Furthermore, responding to these risk factors could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. Substantial and potentially permanent declines in the value of our common shares may adversely affect the liquidity of the market for our common shares.\nOther factors unrelated to our performance that may have an effect on the price and liquidity of our common shares include: positive or negative industry or competitor news; extent of analyst coverage; lessening in trading volume and general market interest in our common shares; the size of our public float; and any event resulting in a delisting of our common shares.\nA large number of common shares may be issued and subsequently sold upon the exercise of existing warrants. The sale or availability for sale of existing warrants or other securities convertible into common shares may depress the price of our common shares.\nAs of March 31, 2021, there were 15.6 million common shares issuable under outstanding warrants at various exercise prices. To the extent that holders of existing warrants sell common shares issued upon the exercise of warrants, the market price of our common shares may decrease due to the additional selling pressure in the market. The risk of dilution from issuances of common shares underlying existing warrants may cause shareholders to sell their common shares, which could further contribute to any decline in our common share market price.\nAny downward pressure on the price of our common shares caused by the sale of common shares issued upon the exercise of existing warrants could encourage short sales by third parties. In a short sale, a prospective seller borrows common shares from a shareholder or broker and sells the borrowed common shares. The prospective seller anticipates that the common share price will decline, at which time the seller can purchase common shares at a lower price for delivery back to the lender. The seller profits when the common share price declines because it is purchasing common shares at a price lower than the sale price of the borrowed common shares. Such short sales of common shares could place downward pressure on the price of our common shares by increasing the number of common shares being sold, which could lead to a decline in the market price of our common shares.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common shares and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future because, among other reasons, we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance our business. The future payment of cash dividends will be dependent on factors such as cash on hand and achieving profitability, the financial requirements to fund growth, our general financial condition and other factors our board of directors may consider appropriate in the circumstances. Until we pay cash dividends, which we may never do, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their common shares unless they sell them.\nIf we fail to meet applicable listing requirements, the NASDAQ Stock Market or the TSXV may delist our common shares from trading, in which case the liquidity and market price of our common shares could decline.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market and the TSXV, but we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market and the TSXV in the future. In the past, we have received notices from the NASDAQ Stock Market that we have not been in compliance with its continued listing standards, and we have taken responsive actions and regained compliance.\nOn February 28, 2020, we received written notification from the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department for failing to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, as required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) - bid price (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Rule\u201d). Under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) - compliance period, we initially had 180 calendar days to regain compliance.\nOn April 17, 2020, we were informed that NASDAQ had granted temporary regulatory relief related to its minimum bid price requirement due to the COVID-19 pandemic for all NASDAQ-listed companies and therefore extended the deadline for us to regain compliance to November 9, 2020.\nOn November 11, 2020, we were further informed that NASDAQ had granted an additional 180 calendar days, or until May 10, 2021, for us to regain compliance.\nOn May 11, 2021, we received notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that, based upon our non-compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement set forth in (the Minimum Bid Price Rule) as of May 10, 2021, our common shares were subject to delisting unless we timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d).\nWe requested and were granted a hearing on June 17, 2021, which will stay any further action by Nasdaq pending the conclusion of the hearing process.\nAt the hearing, we presented a detailed plan of compliance for the Panel\u2019s consideration, which included our commitment to implement a share consolidation if needed to evidence compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. Should we determine that a share consolidation is necessary or otherwise advisable to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, we would likely take such action concurrently with the completion of our proposed acquisition of Grace.\nIf we fail to comply with listing standards and the NASDAQ Stock Market or TSXV delists our common shares, we and our shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our common shares;\n\u00b7 reduced liquidity for our common shares;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common shares are \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which would require brokers trading in our common shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common shares;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news about us and analyst coverage of us; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability for us to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future.\nWe may pursue opportunities or transactions that adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur management, in the ordinary course of our business, regularly explores potential strategic opportunities and transactions. These opportunities and transactions may include strategic joint venture relationships, significant debt or equity investments in us by third parties, the acquisition or disposition of material assets, the licensing, acquisition or disposition of material intellectual property, the development of new drug candidates, significant distribution arrangements, the sale of our common shares and other similar opportunities and transactions. The public announcement of any of these or similar strategic opportunities or transactions might have a significant effect on the price of our common shares. Our policy is to not publicly disclose the pursuit of a potential strategic opportunity or transaction unless we are required to do so by applicable law, including applicable securities laws relating to periodic disclosure obligations. There can be no assurance that investors who buy or sell common shares are doing so at a time when we are not pursuing a particular strategic opportunity or transaction that, when announced, would have a significant effect on the price of our common shares.\nIn addition, any such future corporate development may be accompanied by certain risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities relating to the strategic opportunities and transactions, higher than anticipated transaction costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating operations and personnel of any acquired companies, disruption of our ongoing business, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, and possible dilution to shareholders. We may not be able to successfully overcome these risks and other problems associated with any future acquisitions and this may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the SEC\u2019s disclosure rules and have elected to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the SEC\u2019s disclosure rules, meaning that we have either:\n\u00b7 a public float of less than $250 million; or\n\u00b7 annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year; and\no no public float; or\no a public float of less than $700 million.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are permitted to comply with scaled-back disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers, including with respect to disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We have elected to adopt the accommodations available to smaller reporting companies. Until we cease to be a smaller reporting company, the scaled-back disclosure in our SEC filings will result in less information about our company being available than for other public companies.\nIf investors consider our common shares less attractive as a result of our election to use the scaled-back disclosure permitted for smaller reporting companies, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nAs a non-accelerated filer, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe are a non-accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Therefore, our internal controls over financial reporting will not receive the level of review provided by the process relating to the auditor attestation included in annual reports of issuers that are subject to the auditor attestation requirements. In addition, we cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and trading price for our common shares may be negatively affected.\nU.S. investors may be unable to enforce certain judgments.\nWe are a company existing under the Business Corporations Act (Qu\u00e9bec). Some of our directors and officers are residents of Canada, and substantially all of our assets are currently located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service within the United States upon us or upon some of our directors and officers. Execution by U.S. courts of any judgment obtained against us or any of our directors or officers in U.S. courts may be limited to assets located in the United States. It may also be difficult for holders of securities who reside in the United States to realize in the United States upon judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability of us and our directors and executive officers under the U.S. federal securities laws. There may be doubt as to the enforceability in Canada against non-U.S. entities or their controlling persons, directors and officers who are not residents of the United States, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of liabilities predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws.\nThere is a significant risk that we may be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nCurrent or potential investors in our common shares who are U.S. Holders (as defined below) should be aware that, based on our most recent financial statements and projections and given uncertainty regarding the composition of our future income and assets, there is a significant risk that we may have been classified as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d or \u201cPFIC\u201d for the taxable year that ended on March 31, 2021, and may be classified as a PFIC for our current taxable year and possibly subsequent years. If we are a PFIC for any year during a U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period of our common shares, then such U.S. taxpayer generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of such common shares or any so-called \u201cexcess distribution\u201d received on such common shares, as ordinary income (with a portion subject to tax at the highest rate in effect), and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain or excess distribution. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the interest charge may exceed the total amount of proceeds realized on the disposition, or the amount of excess distribution received, by the U.S. Holder. Subject to certain limitations, a timely and effective QEF Election (as defined below) under Section 1295 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, or a Mark-to-Market Election (as defined below) under Section 1296 of the Code may be made with respect to the common shares. A U.S. Holder who makes a timely and effective QEF Election generally must report on a current basis its share of our net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which we are a PFIC, whether or not we distribute any amounts to our shareholders. A U.S. Holder who makes the Mark-to-Market Election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of their common shares over the holder\u2019s basis therein. This paragraph is qualified in its entirety by the discussion under the heading \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Acquisition, Ownership, and Disposition of Common Shares - Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules\u201d and does not take into account any changes to the composition of our income and assets resulting from the merger. Each current or potential investor who is a U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our common shares, the U.S. federal tax consequences of the PFIC rules, and the availability of any election that may be available to the holder to mitigate adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding shares in a PFIC.", "PERMNO": 13750, "SIC": 2833, "TIC": "ACST"}
