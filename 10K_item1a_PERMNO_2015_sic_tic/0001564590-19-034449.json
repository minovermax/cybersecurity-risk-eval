{"cik": "1691337", "company": "PCSB Financial Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-09-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn the ordinary course of operating our business, we are exposed to a variety of risks inherent to the financial services industry. The following discusses what we believe to be the significant risk factors that could affect our business and operations. If any of the following conditions or events actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your investment in the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment in the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOur emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business lending involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe originate and purchase commercial real estate and commercial business loans. At June 30, 2019, our commercial real estate and commercial business loans totaled $785.0 million, or 71.6% of our loan portfolio. While these types of loans are potentially more profitable than residential mortgage loans, they are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict. These loans also generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, any charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. See \u201c-Loan Underwriting Risks.\u201d\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio subjects us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development, and other land (\u201cADC loans\u201d) represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-owner occupied, non-farm, non-residential properties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital. At June 30, 2019, the Bank\u2019s ADC loans and total commercial real estate loans represented 11% and 292% of total risk-based capital.\nThe purpose of the guidance is to assist banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. Our bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us or that may result in a curtailment of our multi-family and commercial real estate lending and/or the requirement that we maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, either of which would adversely affect our loan originations and profitability. We believe the Company has adequate risk management and monitoring policies and procedures in place to address the requirements of the guidance.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is established through a provision for loan losses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio and adjustment may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Consequently, a problem with one or more loans could require us to significantly increase the level of our provision for loan losses. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nThe FASB has issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASU 2016-13\"), which replaces the current \"incurred loss\" model for recognizing credit losses with an \"expected loss\" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held to maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model required under current U.S. GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, the Company expects that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine the allowance for loan losses and could require the Company to increase our allowance significantly. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If the Company is required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In June 2019, the FASB voted to propose a delay for the implementation of the standard until January 2023 for certain companies, including small reporting companies (as defined by the SEC), non-SEC public companies and private companies. The Company currently qualifies as a small reporting company and would be subject to the proposed delay if approved.\nA worsening of economic conditions could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in our primary market area. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction and consumer loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our profits.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation, recession and instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates.\nIf rates on our deposits reprice upwards faster than the rates on our long-term loans and investments, we would experience compression of our interest rate spread, which would have a negative effect on our profitability. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to redeploy such loan or securities proceeds into lower-yielding assets, which might also negatively impact our income. If interest rates rise, we expect that our net portfolio value of equity would decrease. Net portfolio value of equity represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts. At June 30, 2019, and assuming a 200 basis point increase in market interest rates, we estimate that our net portfolio value of equity would decrease by $39.6 million, or 12.1%. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk-Net Portfolio Value Simulation.\u201d\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. While we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, changes in interest rates can still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio could reduce our profits and reduce our capital levels.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for\nother-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts\u2019 reports and, to a lesser extent, spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. In analyzing an equity issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers industry analysts\u2019 reports, financial performance and projected target prices of investment analysts within a one-year time frame. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Except for a nominal investment in a community development fund, PCSB Bank has no equity securities in its portfolio. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our shareholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value could result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Securities Portfolio.\u201d\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our banking regulators. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of PCSB Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, deposit insurance, monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of federal and state taxation, regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations as could our interpretation of those changes.\nStrong competition within our market area could reduce our profits and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits and may reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult, and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. Our competitors often aggressively price loan and deposit products when they enter into new lines of business or new market areas. If we are not able to effectively compete in our market area, our profitability may be negatively affected. The greater resources and broader offering of deposit and loan products of some of our competitors may also limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws\nand regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us.\nWe, and other participants in the financial services industry upon whom we rely to operate, have been and may in the future become involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings. Most of these proceedings we consider to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and we may not prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Additionally, regulatory proceedings and litigation can be costly and could divert management resources from the Company\u2019s business. Regardless of the merits of a particular claim, and whether or not we ultimately prevail, litigation and regulatory proceedings could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nVarious factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of PCSB Financial without our Board of Directors\u2019 prior approval.\nUnder Federal Reserve Board regulations, for a period of three years following completion of the conversion and offering, no person may directly or indirectly acquire or offer to acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of our common stock without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring control of a bank holding company. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer \u201ccontrols\u201d the bank holding company. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any bank, including PCSB Bank.\nThere also are provisions in our articles of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt, including a provision that prohibits any person from voting more than 10% of the shares of common stock outstanding. Furthermore, shares of restricted stock and stock options that we have granted or may grant to employees and directors, stock ownership by our management and directors, employment agreements that we have entered into with our executive officers and other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of the Company without the consent of our Board of Directors. Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These additional sources consist primarily of advances from the FHLB and wholesale deposits. As we continue to grow, we are likely to become more dependent on these sources. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability in accessing these additional funding sources. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on retaining certain key personnel.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals who comprise our senior management team. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue\ngenerating functions such as loan and deposit generation. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we and our third-party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any breach, damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the time and money needed to correct the issue. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. The Company has emplaced controls to defeat threats to its operating systems. Despite these safeguards, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures, such as cyber-attacks. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have general liability and cyber-related insurance, however there are limitations on coverage as well as dollar amount. Finally, depending on the type of incident, banking regulators can impose restrictions on our business and consumer laws may require reimbursement of customer losses.\nOur business may be adversely affected by fraud and other financial crimes.\nOur loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, losses may still occur which could cause both financial and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our customers, suppliers, counterparties\nand other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers for our products and services and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe continually encounter technological change and the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could adversely affect our business.\nThe banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for \"non-banks\" to offer traditional bank products and services using innovative technological platforms such as Fintech and Blockchain. These \"digital banks\" may be able to achieve economies of scale and offer better pricing for banking products and services than we can. Our future success will depend, in part, on the ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, its financial condition and results of operations.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers and employees, costly litigation and increased governmental regulation, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions at a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience at that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our valuation of investment securities, our determination of our income tax provision, our determination of goodwill impairment, and our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.\nOur operations may be adversely affected if our external vendors do not perform as expected.\nThe Company relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations. These include, but are not limited to, data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, internet connections and network access. The Company\u2019s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations. If we are unable to find alternative sources for our vendors\u2019 services and products quickly and cost-effectively, the failures of our vendors could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCounterparties expose the Company to risks.\nThe Company intends to use derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, which will expose it to financial and contractual risks with counterparty banks. Additionally, the Company maintains correspondent bank relationships, manages certain loan participations, and engages in securities transactions and other activities with financial counterparties which are customary in the banking business. Financial risks are inherent in these counterparty relationships.\nOur inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect our earnings.\nWe may pursue further expansion through de novo branching or the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of these branches will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income.\nThe risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and result of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions, which present risks, including: regulatory approval delays, operations and personnel integration challenges, potential ongoing business disruption, difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, issues with information systems integration and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a company may deteriorate after the acquisition agreement is signed or after the acquisition closes.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions, increased cybersecurity threats, and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLoan participations could expose the Company to losses.\nWe purchase and participate in residential, business and commercial real estate loans with other financial institutions. The agreements documenting these transactions typically provide for retention by the selling institution of the servicing of the participated loans and require that institution to service the loan with the same degree of care that it uses for loans in its portfolio. However, if the servicing institution fails to administer loans in accordance with its contractual obligations, for example, by neglecting to enforce lender\u2019s rights and remedies against a defaulting borrower, or by waiving or modifying loan terms without our consent, we could incur significant losses, including loss of the outstanding principal balance.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that may have a future impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate. Included in this legislation was a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. In addition, other changes included (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. These changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, such as New York. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends or to repurchase our common stock is subject to regulatory limitations and other limitations.\nPCSB Financial is a separate legal entity from our subsidiary, the Bank, and we do not have significant operations of our own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank\u2019s regulators could assert that payment of dividends or other payments may result in an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us or we are required to contribute capital to the Bank, we may not be able to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.\nWe may be required to transition away from the use of the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) in the future.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associate with, the Company\u2019s floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022\nprompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the Company\u2019s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022\nresult in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based loans, deposits, and securities; and\n\u2022\nrequire the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition the Company\u2019s risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d).\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effects of these developments on the Company\u2019s funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, are uncertain.\nThe performance of Bank's multifamily and mixed-use loans could be adversely impacted by regulation.\nOn June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, impacting about one million rent regulated apartment units. Among other things, the new legislation: (i) curtails rent increases from Material Capital Improvements and Individual Apartment Improvements; (ii) all but eliminates the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation; (iii) does away with vacancy decontrol and high-income deregulation; and (iv) repealed the 20% vacancy bonus. While it is too early to measure the full impact of the legislation, in total, it generally limits a landlord\u2019s ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing the Company\u2019s multi-family loans or the future net operating income of such properties could be potentially impaired.", "PERMNO": 16676, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PCSB"}
