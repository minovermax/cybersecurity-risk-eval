If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Many of the risks and uncertainties described below may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected our business and could in the future adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe effects of a public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken to limit the spread of COVID-19 are uncertain and difficult to predict, but pose the following risks to our business, results of operations and financial condition:\n\u2022\nA likely decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand for our products and disruptions to our operations resulting from the immediate consequences of and responses to the pandemic, including precautionary measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate its spread, which have raised the prospect of an extended global recession, which would adversely impact the businesses of our customers, suppliers and partners;\n\u2022\nChanges in our operations in response to COVID-19 and employee illnesses resulting from the pandemic, which have impacted the way that we operate and conduct business, and may result in inefficiencies or delays and/or negatively impact our operations, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25aa\nreduction in sales and qualification activities with our customers;\n\u25aa\nreduction in product development efforts; and\n\u25aa\nreduction in production levels.\nIn addition there may be incremental costs related to business continuity initiatives, which cannot be avoided or alleviated through succession planning, employees working remotely or teleconferencing technologies as well as inefficiencies, delays, and increased costs resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact and spread of COVID-19 through the changes in our operations which we have enacted at certain of our locations around the world in an effort to protect our employees\u2019 health and well-being (including the implementation of work-from-home policies, social-distancing measures, modified work schedules and shifts, the suspension of employee travel, and limits on the number of employees attending in-person meetings and the number of people permitted to be present at our facilities at any one time);\n\u2022\nManagement focus on mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise, which has resulted and can be expected to continue to result in a diversion of management attention and resources;\n\u2022\nDisruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing of materials, equipment and engineering support, and services from geographic areas that have been impacted by COVID-19 and by efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19;\n\u2022\nA decrease in availability under our credit agreement, which permits us to borrow up to 70% of the value of eligible securities held at the time the line of credit is accessed, due a decrease in the value of eligible securities resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on global markets; and\n\u2022\nDifficulty accessing capital, if needed in the future, through a sale of securities, or in obtaining favorable terms of such securities, due to market conditions generally or a decline or volatility in the market for our securities.\nThe resumption of normal business operations after such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers. These effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, legal exposure, or financial condition. The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, resurgences, the severity of newly identified strains of the virus and the timing, availability and efficacy of vaccines cannot be determined. A sustained or prolonged outbreak, or a delayed or slower-than-anticipated vaccine rollout, could exacerbate the adverse impact of such measures.\nOur largest customers account for a substantial portion of our revenue, and our revenue and cash flows could decline considerably if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or delay or cancel a large order.\nSales to end user customers that individually represent at least five percent of our revenue typically account for, in the aggregate, a considerable amount of our revenue. We operate in the highly concentrated, capital-intensive semiconductor device manufacturing industry. Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and this trend is expected to continue. If any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems in the future, or if they delay or cancel a large order, our revenue and cash flows could meaningfully decline. We expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a sizable portion of our revenue. In addition, as large semiconductor device manufacturers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers, we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated.\nOur customers may be unable to pay us for our products and services.\nOur customers include some companies that may, from time to time, encounter financial difficulties. If a customer\u2019s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable balance and unbilled services. The bankruptcy of a customer with a substantial account balance owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a customer declares bankruptcy after paying us certain invoices, a court may determine that we are not properly entitled to that payment and may require repayment of some or all of the amount we received, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nVariations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nVariations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenue and cash flows, and consequently, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate widely from period to period. This variation could cause our stock price to decline. Our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our inspection and/or film metrology systems and many people are involved in the evaluation process. We expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems in the semiconductor fabrication process. The length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe efforts of our sales force;\n\u2022\nthe complexity of the customer\u2019s fabrication processes;\n\u2022\nthe internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer;\n\u2022\nthe customer\u2019s budgetary constraints; and\n\u2022\nthe quality and sophistication of the customer\u2019s current metrology, inspection or lithography equipment.\nBecause of the number of factors influencing the sales process, the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer and receive payment, if ever, varies widely in length. Our sales cycles, including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order to the time we recognize revenue, typically range from three to twenty-four months. Sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer, particularly with customers in Asia. During these cycles, we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue, and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts. If we do make a sale, our customers often purchase only one of our systems, the performance of which they then evaluate for a lengthy period before purchasing any more of our systems. The number of additional products a customer purchases, if any, depends on many factors, including the customer\u2019s capacity requirements. The period between a customer\u2019s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from three months to a year or longer, and variations in the length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our operating results and, possibly, in our stock price.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. Our profitability will decline if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand when managing inventory.\nWe typically plan production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially, which could lead to excess inventory write-downs and resulting negative impacts on gross margin and net income. We have limited visibility into our customers\u2019 inventories, future customer demand and the product mix that our customers will require, which could adversely affect our production forecasts and operating margins. In addition, innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. If we overestimate our customers\u2019 requirements, we may have excess inventory, which could lead to obsolete inventory and unexpected costs.\nConversely, if we underestimate our customers\u2019 requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could lead to foregone revenue opportunities, loss of potential market share and damage to customer relationships as product deliveries may not be made on a timely basis, disrupting our customers\u2019 production schedules. In response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from outside suppliers and foundries, we periodically order materials in advance of customer demand. This advance ordering has in the past and may in the future result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write-downs if expected orders fail to materialize, or other factors make our products less saleable. In addition, any significant future cancellation or deferral of product orders could adversely affect our revenue and margins, increase inventory write-downs due to obsolete inventory, and adversely affect our operating results and stock price.\nOur earnings could be negatively affected and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to predict our inventory needs in an accurate and timely manner and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents in the event that our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products. Any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products, thus adversely affecting our revenue.\nMost of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the United States, subjecting us to operational, financial and political risks, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, political and economic instability, outbreaks of hostilities, natural disasters, climate change and difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and foreign branch operations, as well as risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.\nDue to the significant level of our international sales, we are subject to a number of material risks, including:\nCompliance with foreign laws. Our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, protection of our intellectual property, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law.\nUnexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements including tariffs and other market barriers. The semiconductor device industry is a high-visibility industry in many of the European and Asian countries in which we sell our products. Because the governments of these countries have provided extensive financial support to our semiconductor device manufacturing customers in these countries, we believe that our customers could be disproportionately affected by any trade embargoes, excise taxes, tariffs or other restrictions imposed by their governments on trade with United States companies such as ourselves, particularly with respect to the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China.\nOver the last several years and accelerating in 2020, the U.S. government has significantly expanded export controls on certain technologies and commodities to certain markets, particularly with respect to semiconductor and other high technology exports to China. For example, effective June 29, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed new export controls on the transfer of many U.S. products and technologies, including many commercial-grade electronics, to \u201cmilitary end users\u201d or for \u201cmilitary end use\u201d in China, which may include many Chinese commercial companies that sell products to or do business with the Chinese military. Likewise, beginning in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed significant restrictions on the transfer of any products from the United States, as well as many products produced overseas that incorporate U.S. content or rely on U.S. software or technology, to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and a large number of its overseas affiliates, including HiSilicon, followed by a comparable action in December of 2020, related to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)., and a large number of its overseas affiliates, including Ningbo Semiconductor International Corporation (NSIC). The U.S. government is also engaged in an ongoing process of assessing which \u201cemerging and foundational technologies\u201d warrant new or additional controls, which could subject additional U.S.-origin products and services to more stringent export restrictions. It is possible that these modified regulations, and any future regulations could reduce demand for our products. In particular, these restrictive measures may reduce overall global demand for our customers\u2019 products or for other products produced or manufactured in the United States or based on United States technology, in turn reducing demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are faced with various risks that may be associated with our compliance with existing, new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, regulations and rules enacted by governments and/or their regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate as well as rules and policies implemented at our customer sites. These laws, regulations, rules and policies could relate to any of an array of issues including, but not limited to, environmental, tax, intellectual property, trade secrets, product liability, contracts, antitrust, employment, securities, import/export and unfair competition. In the event that we fail to comply with or violate U.S. or foreign laws or regulations or customer policies, we could be subject to civil or criminal claims or proceedings\nthat may result in monetary fines, penalties or other costs against us or our employees, which may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, customer relations and ability to conduct our business.\nPolitical and economic instability. We are subject to various global risks related to political and economic instabilities in countries in which we derive sales. If terrorist activities, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability occurs outside of the U.S., these events may result in reduced demand for our products. There is considerable political instability in Taiwan related to its disputes with China and in South Korea related to its disputes with North Korea. In addition, several Asian countries, particularly Japan, have experienced significant economic instability. An outbreak of hostilities or other political upheaval in China, Taiwan or South Korea, or an economic downturn in Japan or other countries, would likely harm the operations of our customers in these countries. The effect of these types of events on our revenue and cash flows could be material because we derive substantial revenue from sales to semiconductor device foundries in Taiwan such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., from memory chip manufacturers in South Korea such as Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and from semiconductor device manufacturers in Japan such as Toshiba Corporation.\nNatural disasters and climate change. Natural disasters, changes in climate and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners). The occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes, tropical storms, fires, cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, volcanic eruptions and weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, may disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our Milpitas operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. There may also be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political unrest, including war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks.\nDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations. During periods of tension between the governments of the United States and certain other countries, it is often difficult for United States companies such as ours to staff and manage operations in such countries. Language and other cultural differences may also inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign research and development teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple remote locations performing various development, quality assurance, and yield ramp analysis projects.\nCurrency fluctuations as compared to the U.S. Dollar. A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, if the dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies, our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the United States and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the United States. These conditions could negatively impact our international sales. Foreign sales also expose us to collection risk in the event it becomes more expensive for our foreign customers to convert their local currencies into U.S. dollars. Additionally, in the event a larger portion of our revenue becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk.\nFCPA and Other Anti-Corruption Laws. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"FCPA\"), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Also, similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some of our distribution partners are located in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. The policies and procedures we have implemented to discourage these practices by our employees, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or international anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, consultants or agents.\nIf we deliver systems with defects, our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease.\nOur systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced. Defects may be created during probing, bumping, dicing or general handling, and can have a major impact on device and process quality. When this occurs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed. Further, if our systems contain errors, defects or bugs, computer viruses or malicious code as a result of cyber-attacks to our computer networks, we may be\nrequired to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems. Defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers. We have agreed to indemnify our customers under certain circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems. Our product liability insurance policy currently provides $2.0 million of aggregate coverage, with an overall umbrella limit of $14.0 million. In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.\nIf we are not successful in developing new and enhanced products for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry, we will lose sales and market share to our competitors.\nWe operate in an industry that is highly competitive and subject to evolving industry standards, rapid technological changes, rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new, higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles. To be competitive in our demanding market, we must continually design, develop and introduce in a timely manner new lithography, inspection and metrology process control systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor device manufacturers. We must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our research and development activities. We may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems, and we may not ultimately be successful in our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products or in responding effectively to technological change, as not all research and development activities result in viable commercial products. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to develop new products for the most opportunistic new markets and applications. Any significant delay in releasing new systems could cause our products to become obsolete, adversely affect our reputation, give a competitor a first-to-market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share.\nIn addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently offer or may offer in the future. They may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those that we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.\nFurther, customers that may otherwise desire to purchase our products from us and purchase other products from our competitors may nevertheless purchase competing products from our competitors rather than purchase our products due to a variety of reasons, including to gain favor or volume pricing from our competitors.\nIf new products developed by us do not gain general market acceptance, we will be unable to generate revenue and recover our research and development costs.\nInspection, lithography and metrology product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in semiconductor device manufacturing technology, coordinate technical personnel, and identify and eliminate system design flaws. Further, our products are complex and often the applications to our customers\u2019 businesses are unique. Any new systems we introduce may not achieve or sustain a significant degree of market acceptance and sales.\nWe expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems and refining our existing systems. In light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry, these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of those systems. Our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems are subject to a wide variety of challenges during the development cycle, including start-up bugs, design defects, and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems. In addition, since our customers are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our systems, our anticipated product orders may not materialize, or orders that are placed may be canceled. As a result, if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue and cash flow to recover our research and development costs and our market share, revenue, operating results or stock price would be negatively impacted.\nEven if we are able to develop new products that gain market acceptance, sales of these new products could impair our ability to sell existing products.\nCompetition from our new systems could have a negative effect on sales of our existing systems and the prices that we could charge for these systems. We may also divert sales and marketing resources from our current systems in order to successfully launch and promote our new or next generation systems. This diversion of resources could have a further negative effect on sales of our current systems and the value of inventory.\nOur integrated metrology systems are integrated with systems sold independently by wafer fabrication equipment suppliers, and a decrease in sales by these suppliers, or the development of competing systems by these suppliers, could harm our business.\nWe believe that sales of integrated metrology systems will continue to be an important source of our net revenues. Sales of our integrated metrology systems depend upon the ability of a small number of wafer fabrication equipment suppliers to sell semiconductor manufacturing equipment products that are compatible with our metrology systems as components. If these suppliers, such as Applied Materials, Inc., Ebara Corporation, Lam Research Corporation and Tokyo Electron, are unable to sell such products, if they choose to focus their attention on products that do not integrate our systems, or if they choose to develop competing systems, our business could suffer.\nIf our relationships with our large customers deteriorate, our product development activities could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers. In order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner, we must continue to collaborate closely with our largest customers. Our relationships with these and other customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding trends in the semiconductor device industry, which enables us to better plan our product development activities. If our current relationships with our large customers are impaired, or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future, our product development activities could be adversely affected.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and, therefore, lose our competitive advantage.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, it will give our competitors a significant advantage. We own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our transparent and opaque thin film metrology, lithography and macro-defect inspection systems, and have filed applications for additional patents. Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future.\nIn addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. Further, third parties may also design around these patents. In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology. We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties. Even though these agreements are in place, there can be no assurances that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition. Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.\nThe laws of some foreign countries, including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where we do business, do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad. For example, litigation discovery practice in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan is not as robust as the U.S., so it can be more difficult to determine if a company is infringing on our patents and more challenging to bring a lawsuit. Similarly, China\u2019s protection of intellectual property rights historically has been less stringent and robust compared to other countries such as the United States, and consequently intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Monitoring and preventing unauthorized use are also difficult and the measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Accordingly, infringement of our intellectual property rights poses a serious risk of doing business in China. Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries. If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.\nProtection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights.\nWe may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us or to determine the scope or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights. Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage.\nIn addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or systems infringe, or may infringe, on the proprietary rights of these third parties. These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products or systems stopped by an injunction. Infringement claims could also cause product or system delays or require us to redesign our products or systems, and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenue. We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party\u2019s proprietary rights. We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, the loss of important intellectual property rights could hinder our ability to sell our systems or to make the sale of these systems more expensive.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and increased competition could impair sales of our products or cause us to reduce our prices.\nThe market for semiconductor capital equipment is highly competitive. We face substantial competition from established companies in each of the markets we serve. We principally compete with KLA Corporation, Nova Measuring Instruments, Camtek and Veeco Instruments. We compete to a lesser extent with Nikon. Each of our products also competes with products that use different metrology, inspection or lithography techniques. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources, broader product offerings and service capabilities and larger installed customer bases than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, which, in turn, could impair sales of our products. Further, there may be significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors, which, in turn, may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs.\nMany of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor capital equipment. We believe that our global support and service infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of our customers and potential customers. However, some of our competitors have more extensive infrastructures than we do, which could place us at a disadvantage when competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers. Many of our competitors are investing heavily in the development of new systems that will compete directly with our systems. We have, from time to time, selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share, and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions. We expect our competitors in each product area to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices and performance characteristics. These product introductions would likely require us to decrease the prices of our systems and increase the level of discounts that we grant our customers. Price reductions or lost sales as a result of these competitive pressures would reduce our total revenue and could adversely impact our financial results.\nBecause of the high cost of switching equipment vendors in our markets, it is sometimes difficult for us to win new customers from our competitors even if our systems are superior to theirs.\nWe believe that once a semiconductor device manufacturer has selected one vendor\u2019s capital equipment for a production-line application, the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor\u2019s equipment for the life of the application. Once a vendor\u2019s equipment has been installed in a production line application, a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production-line downtime in order to switch to another vendor\u2019s equipment. Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer\u2019s expense of switching to our systems, it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that manufacturer once it has selected another vendor\u2019s capital equipment for an application.\nWe must attract and retain experienced senior executives and other key personnel with knowledge of semiconductor device manufacturing and inspection, metrology or lithography equipment and related software to help support our future growth, and competition for such personnel in our industry is high.\nOur success depends, to a significant degree, upon the continued contributions of our key executive management, engineering, sales and marketing, customer support, finance and manufacturing personnel. The loss of any of these key personnel through resignations, retirement or other circumstances, each of whom would be extremely difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results. Although we have employment and noncompetition agreements with key members of our senior management team, these individuals or other key employees may still leave us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives. In addition, to support our future growth, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees. Competition for such personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.\nIn order to attract and retain executives and other key employees, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and stock-based compensation. If the anticipated value of the our stock-based incentive awards does not materialize so that they cease to be viewed as valuable, if our profits decrease, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened.\nAny prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.\nWe produce the majority of our systems in our manufacturing facilities located in Milpitas, California and Bloomington, Minnesota. We use contract manufacturers in China, Israel, Japan and the United States. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility. As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines. If we cannot timely deliver our systems, our results from operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may outsource select manufacturing activities to third-party service providers, which decreases our control over the performance of these functions and may result in lower quality and functionality of our products.\nWe may outsource product manufacturing to third-party service providers. Outsourcing reduces our control over the performance of the outsourced functions. Dependence on outsourcing may also adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market. If we do not effectively manage our outsourcing strategy or if third party service providers do not perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, manufacturing interruptions or inefficiencies in the operation of our supply chain, any or all of which could delay our delivery of products to our customers, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are in the process of consolidating a world-wide enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, and problems with the design or implementation of this ERP system could interfere with our business and operations.\nWe are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming all our operations to one global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s books and records and enhance the speed and quality of information provided to our management team for use in the operation and management of our business. The Company\u2019s ERP transition has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant human and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP transition without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Beyond cost and scheduling, if there are flaws in the implementation of the ERP system, or if the ERP system does not operate as expected, this may pose risks to the Company\u2019s ability to operate successfully and efficiently, including the risk that the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting may be negatively impacted, affecting our ability to make timely and accurate SEC filings. If we are unable to successfully implement the consolidated ERP system as planned, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIf our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, to our data, or to our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nAs part of our business, we store our data and certain data about our customers, vendors and employees in our information technology system. While we have security measures in place that are designed to protect this information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, if these measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, break-ins or otherwise, and someone obtains unauthorized access to our customers\u2019, vendors\u2019 or employees\u2019 data, we could face loss of business, regulatory investigations or court orders, our reputation could be severely damaged, we could be required\nto expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate the problem, as well as incur significant costs and liabilities, including due to litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and costs for remediation and other incentives offered to customers.\nCyber-attacks and other malicious internet-based activities continue to increase. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our expanded reliance on remote access to our information systems has further increased our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. If any of these events occur, our or our customers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 information could be accessed or disclosed improperly. Any or all of these issues could negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to choose to purchase from our competitors, result in reputational damage or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) is a regulation in European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. Appropriate technical and organizational measures are necessary to implement these data protection principles. We may also be subject to other data privacy laws in the United States and the other countries in which we operate.\nOur ability to fulfill our backlog may have an effect on our long-term ability to procure contracts and fulfill current contracts.\nOur ability to fulfill our backlog may be limited by our ability to devote sufficient financial and human capital resources and may be limited by available material supplies. If we do not fulfill our backlog in a timely manner, we may experience delays in product delivery, which would postpone receipt of revenue from those delayed deliveries. Additionally, if we are consistently unable to fulfill our backlog, this may be a disincentive to customers to award large contracts to us in the future until they are comfortable that we can effectively manage our backlog.\nIf we do not manage our supply chain effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe need to continually evaluate our global supply chains and assess opportunities to reduce costs. We must also enhance quality, speed and flexibility to meet changing demand for our products and product mix and uncertain market conditions. Our success also depends in part on refining our cost structure and supply chains so that we have flexibility and can maintain and improve profitability. Although the current tariff environment has not had a material adverse effect on our costs to date, further deterioration in the tariff environment, or changes in suppliers, may cause our costs to increase, which if we are not able to offset by charging higher sales prices, will cause a decline in our margins. To improve our margins on a product, we will need to establish high volume supply agreements with our vendors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to timely negotiate vendor supply agreements on improved terms and conditions, or at all. Failure to achieve the desired level of cost reductions could adversely affect our financial results. Despite our efforts to control costs and increase efficiency in our facilities, changes in demand could still cause us to realize lower operating margins and profitability.\nWe obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a limited group of suppliers and do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers. Our dependence on limited source suppliers of components and our lack of long-term contracts with many of our suppliers expose us to several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality. Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our systems, damage our customer relationships and reduce our sales. From time to time in the past, we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving shipments from our suppliers. The lead-time required for shipments of some of our components can be as long as six months. In addition, the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for lasers and certain optics could be as long as a year, and the lead time required to qualify new suppliers of other components could be as long as nine months. If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our systems. Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves, and we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner.\nOur success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of\nidentifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions, and, from time to time, acquiring one or more businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves. We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate. Integrating any business, product, technology or service into our current operations could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business. Further, there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and potential acquisitions, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operational matters and current products and customers;\n\u2022\nlack of synergy or the inability to successfully integrate the new business or to realize expected synergies;\n\u2022\nfailure to commercialize the new technology or business;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet the expected performance of the new technology or business;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key employees and customer or supplier relationships;\n\u2022\nlower-than-expected market opportunities or market acceptance of any new products; and\n\u2022\nunexpected reduction of sales of existing products as a result of the introduction of new products.\nOur inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on favorable terms, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities. We might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings to finance any acquisition. In that event, we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financing, that result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets, write-down of other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions and purchase accounting could harm our business and operating results.\nIf we cannot effectively manage growth, our business may suffer.\nOver the long-term, we intend to grow our business by increasing our sales efforts and completing strategic acquisitions. To effectively manage growth, we must, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage, train and manage a larger sales force and additional service personnel;\n\u2022\nexpand the geographic coverage of our sales force;\n\u2022\nexpand our information systems;\n\u2022\nidentify and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations; and\n\u2022\nadminister appropriate financial and administrative control procedures.\nGrowth of our business will likely place a significant strain on our management, financial, operational, technical, sales and administrative resources. Any failure to effectively manage our growth may cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Tax Laws, Financial Markets and the Environment\nChanges in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) recoverability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), released guidance covering various topics, including country-by-country reporting, definitional changes to permanent establishment and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\n(\u201cBEPS\u201d), an initiative that aims to standardize and modernize global tax policy. Depending on the final form of guidance adopted by OECD members and legislation ultimately enacted, if any, there may be significant consequences for us due to our international business activities, including, but not limited to, an increase in our tax uncertainty and adverse effects on our provision for income taxes.\nTurmoil or fluctuations in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and our factoring arrangements may expose us to additional risks.\nIn the past, global credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the tightening of the credit markets, the weakening of the global economy and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments. Adverse economic conditions, such as sustained periods of economic uncertainty or a crisis in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain credit from the capital financial markets, or from trade creditors was impaired. In addition, a worsening economy or an economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability to finance the purchase of systems from us or our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with product, either of which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. In addition, we enter into factoring arrangements with certain financial institutions to sell a certain portion of our trade receivables. If we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failure to collect the trade receivables. However, by entering into these arrangements, we are exposed to additional risks. If any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring arrangements, we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements, which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSome of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local, and international laws governing the environment, including those relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, labeling, and human exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. We could incur costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses. We may unintentionally violate environmental laws or regulations in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes.\nRisks Related to the 2019 Merger\nAny ongoing actions related to the combination of the businesses of Rudolph and Nanometrics may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2019 Merger, which may adversely affect our business results and negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nThe success of the 2019 Merger depends on, among other things, our ability to combine the businesses of Rudolph and Nanometrics in a manner that realizes cost savings and facilitates growth opportunities.\nIn addition, we must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the 2019 Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the 2019 Merger, as well as any delays encountered in any remaining activities which are part of the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon our revenues, level of expenses and operating results, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nIn addition, any remaining integration activities may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what we\nexpect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If we are not able to adequately address any remaining integration challenges, we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of Rudolph and Nanometrics.\nThe failure to complete the successful integration of the businesses and operations of Rudolph and Nanometrics in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results.\nPrior to completion of the 2019 Merger, Rudolph and Nanometrics operated independently. There can be no assurances that their businesses can be fully integrated successfully. It is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of our ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs or an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, continue to be addressed in integrating the operations of Rudolph and Nanometrics in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2019 Merger so we perform as expected:\n\u2022\nintegrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers;\n\u2022\nharmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\u2022\nconsolidating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology infrastructure; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of management and resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other opportunities that may have been beneficial, which may disrupt our business.\nRisks Related to the Global Economy and Semiconductor Industry\nCyclicality in the semiconductor device industry has led to substantial decreases in demand for our systems and may, from time to time, continue to do so.\nOur operating results are subject to significant variation due to global economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor device industry. Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers, which, in turn, depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors. The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. In recent years, the industry has experienced significant downturns, generally in connection with declines in economic conditions. This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected, and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe may also experience supplier or customer issues as a result of adverse macroeconomic conditions. If our customers have difficulties in obtaining capital or financing, this could result in lower sales. Customers with liquidity issues could also result in an increase in bad debt expense. These conditions could also affect our key suppliers, which could affect their ability to supply parts and result in delays of our customer shipments.\nOur future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography and metrology equipment.\nWe target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for defect inspection, metrology and lithography. If for any reason the market for microelectronic device inspection, lithography or metrology equipment fails to grow in the long term, we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and maintain our historical growth in the long term. Growth in the inspection market is dependent to a large extent upon microelectronic manufacturers replacing manual inspection with automated inspection technology. Growth in the metrology market is dependent to a large extent upon new chip designs and capacity expansion of microelectronic manufacturers. Growth in the lithography market is dependent on the development of cost-effective packaging with high fine pitch RDLs, ultimately migrating to multi-die, large, form-factor packages. There can be no assurance that manufacturers will undertake these actions at the rate we expect.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nProvisions of our charter documents and of Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and/or delay, deter or prevent a change in control of our company.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions also limit the circumstances in which a premium can be paid for our common stock and in which a proxy contest for control of our board may be initiated. These provisions provide for:\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder actions through written consent;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chief executive officer or Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations by stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board may determine; and\n\u2022\nThe authority of our board, without stockholder approval, to adopt a stockholder rights plan.\nWe are also entitled to avail ourselves of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could inhibit changes in control of the Company.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors affecting our stock price may include:\n\u2022\nvariations in operating results from quarter to quarter;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market price per share of our public company customers;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the semiconductor and other industries into which we sell products;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical changes, hostilities or natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other future infectious disease pandemics, on the global economy and on our customers, suppliers, employees, and business\n\u2022\nlow trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nthe number of firms making a market in our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced periods of significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours. Any such market fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90377, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "ONTO"}
