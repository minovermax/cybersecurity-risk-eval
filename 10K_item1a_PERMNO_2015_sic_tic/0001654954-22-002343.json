Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\u00b7\nWe have a limited operating history, are not profitable and may never become profitable.\n\u00b7\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform.\n\u00b7\nWe have devoted and expect to continue to devote a significant portion of our financial and managerial resources on the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and cannot be certain that it will be successfully commercialized.\n\u00b7\nWe face unproven markets for our products.\n\u00b7\nOur dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\n\u00b7\nThe commercial potential of our products is difficult to predict. The market for any product, or for animal diagnostics and medical devices overall, is uncertain and may be smaller than we anticipate, which could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nOur existing and future products will face significant competition and may be unable to compete effectively.\n\u00b7\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct certain portions of our development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain to complete the development of or commercialize our products.\n\u00b7\nWe will rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our products. If we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the manufacturing of our products could be delayed.\n\u00b7\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop any of our existing or future product candidates, conduct our in-licensing and development efforts and commercialize any of our existing or future products.\n\u00b7\nOur ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is limited.\n\u00b7\nOur diagnostic technologies depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from marketing our diagnostic product candidates.\n\u00b7\nWe expect that the price of our common shares will fluctuate substantially.\n\u00b7\nWe have incurred significant costs as a result of operating as a U.S. and Canadian public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\n\u00b7\nWe believe that we will be a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d or PFIC, for the current taxable year, which could subject certain U.S. investors to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a limited operating history, are not profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe have generated limited revenues from our products. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs and administrative expenses. Our net loss and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, was approximately $20.9 million and $16.9 million. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021, was approximately $121.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had total shareholders' equity of approximately $268.4 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, as we continue our integration efforts in relation to the PulseVet acquisition and product development and commercialization activities. Even if we succeed in developing and broadly commercializing our products, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or cease operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to achieve our goals.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted the development and commercialization of our products. For example, the development of the assays required to successfully market our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform has been delayed as a result of COVID-19 related disruptions affecting our development partner. In addition, we will require significant working capital to operate and grow the PulseVet business.\nWe are also seeking to identify potential complementary opportunities in the animal health sectors. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to develop our existing products and any other product that we may develop or acquire. These expenditures will include: costs of developing and validating our diagnostic products and related assays and consumables; costs associated with conducting any required clinical trials; costs associated with completing other research and development activities; costs of identifying additional potential products; costs associated with payments to technology licensors and maintaining other intellectual property; costs of obtaining any regulatory approvals; costs associated with securing contract manufacturers to meet our commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities; costs associated with marketing and selling our existing products and other products we acquire, and costs to integrate any future acquisitions into our then, existing business. In addition, our existing and future development agreements may require us to pay certain development costs. We will not control the timing of these payments. We also may incur unanticipated costs. Because the outcome of our development activities and commercialization efforts is inherently uncertain, the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our existing or future products may be greater or less than we anticipate.\nAs a result, we may need to obtain additional capital to fund the development of our business. Except for our unsecured working capital line we have no existing agreements or arrangements with respect to any financings, and any such financings may result in dilution to our shareholders, the imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business or the value of our common shares.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our existing or future diagnostics and medical device products;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our existing or future diagnostics or medical device products;\n\u00b7\nthe number and characteristics of the diagnostics and/or medical device products we pursue;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of contract manufacturers to manufacture our existing and future diagnostic and medical device products and any additional products we seek to commercialize;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of commercialization activities, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u00b7\nthe cost to integrate any future acquisitions into our then, existing business;\n\u00b7\nthe expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with being a public company;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe scope and terms of our business plans from time to time, and our ability to realize upon our business plans; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing and filing patent applications, maintaining any successfully obtained patents and protecting and enforcing any such patents.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate one or more of our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic materially and adversely affected the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the initial five assays. In response to the pandemic, our development partner had reduced the number of employees working in its facilities for a period of time which initially delayed the completion of the verification and validation of the five initial TRUFORMA\u00ae assays and the manufacturing of commercial quantities of the TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the related assays. Veterinary hospitals and clinics that had agreed to participate in the validation of our initial TRUFORMA\u00ae assays either shut down for a period of time or limited their operations to those involving only life-threatening conditions. Potential customers have at times restricted access to their facilities which has affected and may continue to affect our ability to perform on-site demonstrations and other marketing activities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the spread and severity of COVID-19 and new and existing variants, and the effectiveness of governmental actions in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted our development partners and the COVID-19 pandemic, and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak disrupted our development partners and the COVID-19 pandemic, and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. For example, our development partner for our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the related assays had reduced the number of employees working in its facility which significantly impacted our expected timing for the completion of the development and the commencement of the commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and the related assays. If our suppliers are unable or fail to fulfill their obligations to us for any reason, we may not be able to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand or our obligations under sales agreements in a timely manner, and our business could be harmed as a result. As noted above, there is continuing uncertainty relating to the potential effect of COVID-19 on our business. New variants of COVID-19 may arise, infections may become more widespread or severe, governmental responses to the pandemic could restrict the activities of our development partners and should that cause supply disruptions it would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, a significant health epidemic could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the market for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant spike in unemployment and a concomitant decline in economic activity in the U.S. and many other countries and has continued to have significant impact on the economies of the U.S. and the rest of the world. The persistence or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments may have similar effects. Animal owners may be unwilling or unable to seek treatment for their animals in such circumstances, thereby decreasing demand for our products. In addition, as noted above, potential customers for our products have either shut down or limited their operations which has affected and may continue to affect our marketing activities. Potential customers also may be unwilling or unable to invest in new equipment or to introduce new treatments for their patients. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products.\nWe have generated U.S. NOLs, but our ability to use these U.S. NOLs is limited and any future U.S. NOLs we generate may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes.\nOur U.S. businesses have generated consolidated net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cU.S. NOLs\u201d) for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $28.7 million as of December 31, 2021. Our ability to utilize any U.S. NOLs after an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to the rules of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) Section 382. An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, five (5%) percent or more of the value of our shares or are otherwise treated as five (5%) percent shareholders under Section 382 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of the value of our shares by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the value of the shares owned by these shareholders over a three year rolling period. An ownership change could also be triggered by other activities, including the sale of our shares that are owned by our five (5%) shareholders.\nIn the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income we may offset with U.S. NOLs. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our shares in the US operating entity on the date prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect on the date of the ownership change. The long-term tax-exempt rate is published monthly by the IRS. Any unused Section 382 annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective U.S. NOLs (if any).\nWe concluded that, due to the limitations under Section 382 of the Code, it is likely our U.S. NOL carryforwards for the periods prior to February 11, 2021, for approximately $21.0 million are limited to zero, and are not available to offset taxable income generated in the US in future periods. Our U.S. NOL carryforwards are now approximately $7.7 million. In the event another ownership change, as defined under Section 382 of the Code occurs in the future, our ability to utilize any U.S. NOLs may be substantially limited. The consequence of this limitation could be the potential loss of a significant future cash flow benefit because we would no longer be able to substantially offset future taxable income with U.S. NOLs. There can be no assurance that such ownership change will not occur in the future.\nWe have generated net operating loss carryforwards for Canadian income tax purposes, but our ability to use these net operating losses may be limited by our inability to generate future taxable income in Canada.\nOur Canadian businesses have generated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $37.2 million (\u201cCanadian NOLs\u201d) for Canadian federal and provincial income tax purposes. These Canadian NOLs can be available to reduce Canadian income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future Canadian taxable income. However, there can be no assurance that we will generate the taxable income in the future necessary to utilize these Canadian NOLs. Our Canadian NOLs have expiration dates. There can be no assurance that, if and when we generate Canadian taxable income in the future, we will generate such taxable income before our Canadian NOLs expire.\nOur ability to use any U.S. NOLs may be limited by our inability to generate future taxable income.\nU.S. NOLs may be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future U.S. taxable income. The utilization of these U.S. NOLs could have a positive effect on our cash flow. However, there can be no assurance that we will generate the taxable income in the future necessary to utilize these U.S. NOLs and realize the positive cash flow benefit.\nWe have generated Canadian NOLs, but our ability to reserve and use these Canadian NOLs may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes.\nOur ability to utilize the Canadian NOLs after a \u201closs restriction event\u201d is subject to the rules of the Income Tax Act (Canada). A loss restriction event will occur if, among other things, there is change of control (which would generally occur if a person or group of related persons acquired more than 50% of our voting shares). If we experience a \u201closs restriction event\u201d: (i) we will be deemed to have a year-end for Canadian tax purposes and (ii) we will be deemed to realize any unrealized capital losses and our ability to utilize and carry forward Canadian NOLs will be restricted.\nWe have devoted and expect to continue to devote a significant portion of our financial and managerial resources on the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform and cannot be certain that it will be successfully commercialized.\nA major part of our business strategy is the development and commercialization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays. The successful development and commercialization of this product and the related assays will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe successful completion of clinical validation and verification of assays for use with our TRUFORMA\u00ae instrument, which has been materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and other delays involving our strategic partner may take significantly longer than we anticipate, and will depend, in part, upon the satisfactory performance of our strategic partner and third-party contractors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to provide a suite of assays that customers believe address their needs and provide sufficient economic justification for acquiring our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our strategic partner to manufacture supplies for our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic instrument and the related assays and to develop, validate and maintain viable commercial manufacturing processes ensuring that products are safe, effective, and properly labeled;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully market our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays compared to alternative and competing products;\n\u00b7\nthe acceptance and utilization of our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays by veterinarians, pet owners and the animal health community; and\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing or commercializing our TRUFORMA\u00ae diagnostic platform and the related assays or any of our future products. If we are unsuccessful or are significantly delayed in developing and commercializing our products, our business and prospects will be materially adversely affected, and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.\nWe face unproven markets for our existing and future products.\nThe animal diagnostic and medical device markets are less developed than the related human markets and as a result no assurance can be given that our existing and future products will be successful. Animal owners, veterinarians or other veterinary health providers in general may not accept or utilize any products that we may develop or acquire. The animal care industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards, all of which could make our products obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis and to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances. We must continuously enhance our product offerings to keep pace with evolving standards of care. If we do not update our product offerings to reflect new scientific knowledge or new standards of care, our products could become obsolete, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully develop and commercialize our existing and any future products will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to convince the veterinary community of the clinical utility of our products and their potential advantages over existing tests and devices;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness or ability of animal owners to pay for our products and the willingness of veterinarians to recommend our products; and\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of veterinarians to utilize our diagnostic tests and devices.\nOur dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide components in our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations. For example, the development of the assays required to successfully market our TRUFORMA\u00ae platform has been delayed in part, as a result of COVID-19 related disruptions affecting our development partner. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third-party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with applicable regulations or their contractual obligations. Problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to complete development, supply the market, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers.\nIn addition, we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we will seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers may decline to enter into long-term contracts, and we are required to purchase products with short term contracts or on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain an effective direct sales capability, our ability to market and sell our existing and future products and our ability to generate product revenue will be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a result of our experience with the initial commercialization of TRUFORMA\u00ae, we have decided to market and sell our existing and future products directly rather than through distributors. As a result, we have significantly expanded our internal sales and sales support team, which has increased our compensation and other selling expenses. While members of our management team are experienced in the marketing, sale and distribution of animal diagnostic products, we as a company have limited experience in product commercialization and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and motivate qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales team. If we are unable to maintain an effective sales organization, our ability to sell our existing and future products and our ability to generate product revenue will be materially and adversely affected.\nDisruption in the global supply chain could increase our costs and delay, prevent or impair our ability to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on our developmental partners and third-party suppliers and manufacturers to develop and manufacture our products. Global supply chains have been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. For example, supply disruptions have led to a global shortage of semiconductor chips. In addition, shipping delays have increased, and transportation costs have risen significantly. As a result, component costs have increased, and the supply of materials has become less certain and more unpredictable. Any interruption or delay in the supply of parts and components for our products, or the inability to obtain those parts or components at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, could increase our costs and delay, prevent or impair our ability to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe commercial potential of our products is difficult to predict. The market for animal diagnostics and medical devices, is uncertain and may be smaller than we anticipate, which could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe believe that the emerging nature of our industry and our unproven business plan make it difficult to estimate the commercial potential of any of our existing or future products. The market for any product that we seek to commercialize will depend on important factors such as the cost, utility and ease of use of our products, changing standards of care, preferences of veterinarians, the willingness of animal owners to pay for such products, and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the product development process or after commercial introduction. If the market potential for our existing and future products is less than we anticipate due to one or more of these factors, it could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the willingness of animal owners to pay for the use of our products may be less than we anticipate and may be negatively affected by overall economic conditions. Because relatively few animal owners purchase insurance for their animals, such owners are more likely to have to pay for the use of our products directly and may be unwilling or unable to pay for any such use.\nOur existing and future products will face significant competition and may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe development and commercialization of veterinary diagnostics and medical devices is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete effectively with other products in the market and identify potential partners for continued development and commercialization.\nThere are a number of competitors in the companion animal diagnostic market that have substantially greater financial and operational resources and established marketing, sales and service organizations. We expect to compete primarily with commercial clinical laboratories, hospitals\u2019 clinical laboratories other veterinary diagnostic equipment manufacturers and other energy-based therapeutics companies. Our principal competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Inc., Abaxis, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoetis Inc., Heska Corporation, Zoetis Inc., Companion Animal Health, a division of LiteCure, LLC, and Summus Medical Laser, LLC. We must develop our distribution channels and build our direct sales force in order to compete effectively in the veterinary diagnostic market.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially more financial, technical and human resources than we do. Many also have far more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health diagnostics and medical devices. We also expect to compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the fields of animal diagnostics and medical devices. If any competing products are commercialized prior to our products, or if our intellectual property protection fails to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for our products, we may be unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we participate. Contractual agreements between clinics and from competitors may limit practices\u2019 ability to use other tests and technologies due to predetermined minimums in those agreements.\nOur strategic partnerships are important to our business. If we are unable to maintain any of these partnerships, or if these partnerships are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into strategic partnerships that are important to our business and we expect to enter into similar partnerships as part of our growth strategy. These partnerships may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\npartners may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these partnerships;\n\u00b7\npartners may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7\npartners may not pursue development of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development based on development results, changes in the partners\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u00b7\npartners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the partners believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours, which may cause partners to cease to devote resources to the development of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndisagreements with partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research and development of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time consuming and expensive;\n\u00b7\npartners may not properly maintain or defend their intellectual property rights or may use proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate the intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\npartners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u00b7\npartners may learn about our technology and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future;\n\u00b7\nthere may be conflicts between different partners that could negatively affect those partnerships and potentially others; and\n\u00b7\nthe number and type of our partnerships could adversely affect our attractiveness to future partners or acquirers.\nIf any partnerships we enter into do not result in the successful development of our product candidates or if one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may not be able to successfully develop our product candidates, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed, and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates. All of the risks relating to our product development, regulatory approval and commercialization also apply to the activities of our partners and there can be no assurance that our partnerships will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a partner of ours is involved in a business combination or otherwise changes its business priorities, the partner might deemphasize or terminate the development of any technology licensed to it by us. If one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new partners and our perception in the business and financial communities and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe may in the future determine to partner with additional life science and technology companies for development of additional products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for partnership will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed partnership and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable partners on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to access technologies that are important for the future development of our business. If we elect to fund and undertake development activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into partnerships and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct certain portions of our development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to commercialize our product on a timely basis, or not at all.\nWe have used contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d) and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to conduct our manufacturing and research and development activities. We expect to continue to do so, including with respect to our manufacturing, clinical validation, verification and beta testing of our existing and future diagnostic and medical device products. These CMOs and CROs are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs or manage the risks associated with their activities on our behalf. We are responsible to regulatory authorities for ensuring that products subject to regulatory authority are manufactured using good manufacturing practices and studies are conducted in accordance with the development plans and trial protocols, and any failure by our CMOs and CROs to do so may subject us to penalties or harm our credibility with regulators.\nOur agreements with our CMOs and CROs may allow termination by the CMOs and CROs in certain circumstances with little or no advance notice to us. These agreements generally will require our CMOs and CROs to reasonably cooperate with us at our expense for an orderly winding down of the CMOs\u2019 and CROs\u2019 services under the agreements. If the CMOs and CROs conducting our manufacturing and studies do not comply with their contractual duties or obligations to us, or if they experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our development protocols or quality expectations or for any other reason, we may need to secure new arrangements with alternative CMOs and CROs, which could be difficult and costly. In such event, our studies also may need to be extended, delayed or terminated as a result, or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur commercialization of our current and future products may be delayed, and we may be required to expend substantial additional resources.\nThe failure of any CMO and CRO to perform adequately or the termination of any arrangements with any of them may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our products. If we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the manufacturing of our product candidates or products could be delayed.\nWe do not have the capability to manufacture our existing and future products and may not develop that capability in the future. As a result, we expect to rely on CMOs to produce our existing and future products. We expect to enter into contracts with CMOs for the commercial scale production of the products we intend to commercialize. Reliance on CMOs involves risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u00b7\ninability to access production facilities on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\ninability or delay in increasing manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing and product quality issues related to the scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u00b7\ncosts and validation of new equipment and facilities required for commercial level activity;\n\u00b7\na failure to satisfy any applicable regulatory requirements on a consistent basis;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7\ntermination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u00b7\nthe reliance on a single source of supply which, if unavailable, would delay our ability to complete the development and testing and commercialization of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of qualified backup suppliers for supplies that are currently purchased from a single source supplier;\n\u00b7\noperations of our CMOs or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the CMO or supplier;\n\u00b7\ncarrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and\n\u00b7\nthe failure to deliver products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.\nAny of these risks could cause delay in the development and commercialization of our existing and future products, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our existing and future products successfully. Furthermore, if our CMOs fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of our products on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and could lose potential revenue.\nOur existing and future products may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.\nOur existing and future products may not achieve market acceptance among veterinarians and other veterinary health providers and animal pet owners and may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe claims for which our products are intended;\n\u00b7\nthe acceptance by veterinarians and animal pet owners of the product as safe and effective;\n\u00b7\nthe proper training and use of our products by veterinarians;\n\u00b7\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative diagnostics or medical devices;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of our products in relation to alternative diagnostics and willingness to pay for our products, if approved, on the part of veterinarians and pet owners;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of pet owners to pay for the use of our products, relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience and ease of use; and\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our products fail to achieve market acceptance or commercial success, our business could fail and you could lose your entire investment.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop any of our existing or future product candidates, conduct our in-licensing and development efforts and commercialize any of our existing or future products.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, particularly Larry Heaton, our Chief Executive Officer, Ann Marie Cotter, our Chief Financial Officer, and Adrian Lock, CEO of PulseVet. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nConsolidation of our customers could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nVeterinarians will be our primary customers for our existing and future products. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the consolidation of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. If this trend continues, these large clinics and hospitals could attempt to leverage their buying power to obtain favorable pricing from us and other similar companies. Any resulting downward pressure on the prices of any of our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInternational operations expose us to risks inherent in international activities.\nOperating in international markets requires resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. We face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange risk;\n\u00b7\nimport and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation, including uncertainty regarding renegotiation of international trade agreements and partnerships;\n\u00b7\nsales and customer service challenges associated with operating in different countries;\n\u00b7\nenhanced difficulties of integrating foreign acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and working with foreign partners;\n\u00b7\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, and collections issues;\n\u00b7\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and applicable laws of other jurisdictions, employment, ownership, trade, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nmore restrictive or otherwise unfavorable government regulations;\n\u00b7\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u00b7\nwithholding and other tax obligations on remittance and other payments made by our subsidiaries; and\n\u00b7\nunstable regional, economic and political conditions.\nOur inability to manage any of these risks successfully, or to comply with these laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to manage growth successfully, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nContinued growth may place a significant strain on financial, operational, and managerial resources. We must continue to implement and enhance our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our operations, and continue to recruit and train qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that our strategic and operational planning will allow us to adequately manage anticipated growth. In addition, the expense associated with increased manufacturing and sales/marketing may exceed our expectations. Any inability to successfully manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe will need to significantly expand our organization and systems to support our future expected growth. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we will not be successful, and our business could fail.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of diagnostic products and medical devices. We may become subject to product liability claims resulting from the use of our existing and future products. We do not currently have product liability insurance and we may not be able to obtain or maintain this type of insurance in the future. In addition, product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. Being unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures that may be unsuccessful and could adversely dilute your ownership of our company.\nAs part of our business strategy, we expect to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other complementary assets and businesses and may also pursue strategic alliances. As a company, we have limited experience in acquiring other assets or businesses and have limited experience in forming such alliances. We may not be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or become subject to possible stockholder claims in connection with any related-party or third-party acquisitions or other transactions. We also could experience adverse effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles and impairment charges relating to write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets from time to time following an acquisition. Integration of an acquired company requires management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license or strategic alliance.\nTo finance future acquisitions, we may choose to issue our common shares as consideration, which would dilute your ownership interest in us. Alternatively, we may use our working capital to fund an acquisition, which would deplete our resources available to fund operations. Further, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Recently Completed Acquisition of PulseVet\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of PulseVet. These expenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have incurred significant costs associated with the negotiation and consummation of the PulseVet acquisition and expect to incur additional significant costs in connection with the integration of its operations. The substantial majority of the costs incurred to date will be non-recurring expenses and will consist of transaction costs (e.g., legal, accounting), facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. These expenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe failure to integrate PulseVet successfully into our business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order to realize the expected benefits of the PulseVet acquisition, we must successfully integrate the operations or PulseVet with our existing operations. The integration of PulseVet will be a time-consuming and expensive process and could significantly disrupt our business. The anticipated benefits of the transaction, including the realization of revenue, tax benefits, financial benefits or returns and expense and other synergies, may not be fully realized, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the integration may be more expensive or require more senior management involvement than expected or be more disruptive to our existing operations than anticipated. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic-related risks may result in unanticipated regulatory, planning and/or operational delays that may adversely impact the anticipated timeline and achievement of our ongoing integration goals. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Our failure to successfully integrate the operations of PulseVet or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nThe failure to realize the anticipated growth opportunities from our acquisition of PulseVet could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not realize the expected growth opportunities from our acquisition of PulseVet even if we are able to integrate PulseVet\u2019s business successfully. We may incur unanticipated costs related to the operation of PulseVet and we may not achieve the growth potential for the PulseVet business that we expected at the time of acquisition or on our expected time schedule as a result of a number of factors, including our inability to successfully cross-market our or PulseVet\u2019s products. Accordingly, the benefits from the proposed acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies, which could cause our operational and growth assumptions to be inaccurate. Our failure to realize the anticipated growth opportunities from our acquisition of PulseVet could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe assumption of unknown liabilities in the PulseVet acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we acquired all of the membership interests of PulseVet, we obtained ownership of PulseVet subject to all of its liabilities, including contingent and unknown liabilities. Pursuant to the transaction documents for the acquisition, there are limitations and conditions to our ability to recoup unanticipated losses from PulseVet\u2019s former owners. We may also learn additional information about PulseVet\u2019s business that could adversely affect us, such as the existence of unknown liabilities, or matters that potentially affect our ability to comply with applicable laws.\nIf PulseVet\u2019s liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are material additional obligations of which we are not aware, and if we have no recourse against the former owners of PulseVet for such matters, such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe labeling and marketing of our proposed and future products may be subject to post-market regulatory oversight. If a regulatory inquiry is submitted it could prevent or delay our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe labeling and marketing of our product candidates may be subject to post-market regulatory oversight.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture and The Center for Veterinary Biologics (\"USDA-CVB\") and/or the Food and Drug Administration and Center for Veterinary Medicine (\"FDA-CVM\") can delay, limit, or stop commercialization of any of our product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nif they find the labeling is false or misleading;\n\u00b7\nif they find the labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use;\n\u00b7\nif they find the product or packaging to be adulterated;\nVarious government regulations could limit or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our products or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur existing and future products may be subject to post-market oversight by USDA-CBM and/or FDA-CVM regulations.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products, as well as our research and development processes, are subject to similar and potentially more stringent laws in foreign countries.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products; our business practices in the U.S. and abroad, such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws; and immigration and travel restrictions. These legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future.\nAny failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines, penalties and sanctions; product recalls; suspensions or discontinuations of, or limitations or restrictions on, our ability to design, manufacture, market, import, export or sell our products; and damage to our reputation.\nWe are subject to ongoing FDA-CVM or USDA-CVB obligations and continued regulatory oversight, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our products may be subject to labeling and advertising and/or promotional materials requirements and could be subject to other restrictions. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with our products could result in significant penalties.\nThe manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our products may be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary product recalls;\n\u00b7\nfines, warning letters or holds on promotional materials and claims;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u00b7\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms with respect to veterinary diagnostics, medical devices and test kits may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any of our future products and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated and/or licensed products. In addition, FDA-CVM and USDA-CVB regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA-CVM and USDA-CVB in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Similar changes in laws or regulations can occur in other countries. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations in the United States may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any of our existing or future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u00b7\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\u00b7\nrecall, replacement or discontinuance of certain products; and\n\u00b7\nadditional record-keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is limited.\nOur diagnostic and therapeutic technologies are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these technology licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of and compliance with the terms of our licenses\nSome of our products may or may not be covered by a patent. Further if an application is filed, it is not certain that a patent will be granted or if granted whether it will be held to be valid. All of which may impact our market share and ability to prevent others (competitor third parties) from making, selling, or using our products.\nWe intend to rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and license agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our existing and future products. We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. In addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching confidentiality agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. In the future, we may also rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights and contractual rights, and, if not successful, we may not be able to protect the value of our intellectual property. Any litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations regardless of its outcome.\nIf we are unable to obtain trademark registrations for our products our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have trademark registrations for our company name and composite marks comprised of our company name, logo and/or slogan in the U.S., Canada, European Union, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. We also have an allowed application for our name in the U.S. for an expanded listing of diagnostic testing equipment. We have secured registrations for our platform MYZOMEDICA in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. In addition, we have registrations for our \u201cVoice of the Vet\u201d mark in the U.S., Canada, European Union and the United Kingdom.\nWe have also secured registrations for our in-clinic biosensor testing platform product name TRUFORMA several product names in the U.S., Canada the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nWe own four live federal trademark registrations, including one for the testing platform product names PROPULSE, VERSATRODE and VERSATRON and the tradename PULSEVET.\nThird parties may have intellectual property rights, which may require us to obtain a license or other applicable rights to make, sell or use our products. If such rights are not granted or obtained, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain, or license from third parties, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Although we believe our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to conduct our business without incurring liability to third parties, our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of such persons. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur diagnostic and therapeutic technologies depend on certain technologies that are licensed to us. We do not control these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from marketing our diagnostic product candidates.\nOur diagnostic and therapeutic technologies are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of and compliance with the terms of our licenses. We do not control the prosecution, maintenance or filing of the patents and other intellectual property licensed to us, or the enforcement of these intellectual property rights against third parties. The patents and patent applications underlying our licenses were not written by us or our attorneys, and we do not have control over the drafting and prosecution of such rights. Our partners might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of patents and patent applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the intellectual property rights and had control over such drafting and prosecution. We cannot be certain that drafting and/or prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications has been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOur intellectual property agreements with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase our financial or other obligations to our licensors.\nCertain provisions in our intellectual property agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could affect the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or affect financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical or animal health companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, such litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding us or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAlthough we have research coverage by securities and industry analysts, if coverage is not maintained, the market price for our stock may be adversely affected. Our stock price also may decline if any analyst who covers us issues an adverse or erroneous opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our product development and commercialization activities and operating results fail to meet analysts\u2019 expectations. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and possibly adversely affect our ability to engage in future financings.\nWe expect that the price of our common shares will fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common shares has been subject to significant fluctuations, and we expect that the market price of our common shares will remain volatile. At times, the price of our common shares has changed significantly unrelated to any change in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such a change. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common shares. These risks include those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report as well as, among other things:\n\u00b7\nany delays in, or suspension or failure of, any future studies;\n\u00b7\ndelays in the commercialization of our existing or future products;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing and supply issues related to our existing or future products;\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or adverse publicity about us or our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nannouncements relating to future development or license agreements including termination of such agreements;\n\u00b7\nadverse developments with respect to our intellectual property rights or those of our principal collaborators;\n\u00b7\ncommencement of litigation involving us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nany major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7\nnew legislation in the United States and abroad relating to our markets or our industry;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of regulatory approval or disapproval of any of our future products or of regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u00b7\nproduct liability claims, other litigation or public concern about the safety of our existing or future products;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the animal health industry, or in the sectors in which we participate, in particular, including performance of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of social media posts by third parties that may draw attention to our company and increase trading in our common shares by retail investors; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, or the market for stocks in our industry, in particular, may experience broad market fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common shares. Any sudden decline in the market price of our common shares could trigger securities class-action lawsuits against us. If any of our shareholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management would be diverted from our business and operations. We also could be subject to damages claims if we are found to be at fault in connection with a decline in our stock price.\nOur Articles of Amalgamation (as amended) authorize us to issue an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares without shareholder approval and we may issue additional equity securities, or engage in other transactions that could dilute your ownership interest, which may adversely affect the market price of our common shares\nOur Articles of Amalgamation (as amended) authorize our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta), or ABCA to issue an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors may determine from time to time to raise additional capital by issuing common shares, preferred shares or other equity securities. We are not restricted from issuing additional securities, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares or preferred shares. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common shares, or both. Holders of our common shares are not entitled to pre-emptive rights or other protections against dilution. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, the then current holders of our common shares. Additionally, if we raise additional capital by making offerings of debt or preference shares, upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, may receive distributions of our available assets before the holders of our common shares.\nWe have incurred significant costs as a result of operating as a U.S. and Canadian public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a U.S. and Canadian publicly traded company, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and other expenses and will incur additional expenses related to U.S. compliance after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the JOBS Act, and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities have created uncertainty for U.S. and Canadian public companies and increased our costs and time that our board of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities.\nThe Company\u2019s attempt in December 2020 to obtain shareholder approval for a domestication to the State of Delaware was unsuccessful. As a result, the Company will have to continue to comply with legal requirements applicable to a publicly traded company in both Canada and the U.S., resulting in additional legal and financial compliance costs and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. As a result, we are now subject to enhanced reporting and other requirements, including the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, more extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the loss of other related exemptions. We expect that our compliance expenses will increase significantly as a result of this change.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nAs a Canadian public company, we are permitted to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in a manner that meets the standards of U.S. public companies required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. We were required to meet these standards in the course of preparing our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our management has reported on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nIn connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. We will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nIf we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could affect our ability to issue securities in the public markets.\nIf we sell common shares in future financings, shareholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our share price may decline.\nWe may from time-to-time issue additional common shares at a discount from the existing trading price of our common shares. As a result, our shareholders would experience immediate dilution upon the sale of any shares of our common shares at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred shares or common shares. If we issue common shares or securities convertible into common shares, our common shareholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our share price may decline.\nFuture sales of our common shares by our shareholders or the perception that these sales may occur could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of March 1, 2022, we had 979,899,668 common shares outstanding. Substantially all of our outstanding common shares have been registered for resale or other disposition by the holders thereof or are otherwise freely tradable by the holders thereof.\nSales of a substantial number of our common shares by our shareholders or the perception that these sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nWe have never and do not, in the future, intend to pay dividends on our common shares, and your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the market price of our common shares.\nWe have never paid and do not expect to pay dividends on our common shares in the future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and not to pay any cash dividends on our common shares. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our common shares. There is no assurance that our common shares will appreciate in price.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common shares may not be sustained, and you may not be able to sell your common shares.\nOur common shares trade on the NYSE American exchange. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common shares will be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell the common shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling common shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications or technologies using our common shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American. If we are unable to comply with such requirements, our common shares would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors\u2019 ability to effect transactions in our common shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common shares are currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. Although the trading price of our common shares on the date of this report exceeded $0.20 per share, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the trading price of our common shares was well below $0.20 for a significant period of time. We received a deficiency letter from the NYSE American indicating that we were not in compliance with the listing requirements, because our common shares had been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period time. Such deficiency was resolved in January 2021.\nIf the NYSE American delists our common shares from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our common shares would qualify to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u00b7\na determination that our common shares are a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may in future implement the reduction in the stated capital account applicable to our common shares that has been approved by shareholders, and if we do, there may be an adverse effect on holders of common shares or the Company in connection with certain transactions, unless we are able to add back some or all of the stated capital reduction to the stated capital account at that time.\nAt the Company\u2019s annual and special meeting of shareholders held on September 25, 2020, the shareholders approved a special resolution under the ABCA authorizing the reduction of the stated capital account applicable to the common shares to US $1.00 in the aggregate without payment to the shareholders. The special resolution provided that the reduction would be effective upon the date determined by any director or officer of the Company. As of the date hereof, the reduction has yet to be implemented. However, it could be implemented in the future, and if it is implemented, the reduction is expected to apply to the entire stated capital account applicable to the common shares at that time, including stated capital referenceable to common shares issued after the date of the meeting where the special resolution was approved. As disclosed in the proxy circular prepared in connection with the annual and special meeting, the stated capital reduction is not expected to result in any immediate Canadian tax consequences to shareholders, and should not constitute a taxable event to shareholders under United States tax requirements. However, the reduction in stated capital could have future Canadian federal income tax consequences to shareholders or the Company, in connection with certain transactions, including a repurchase of the common shares by the Company or certain reorganization transactions. The Company currently intends that, if the stated capital reduction is implemented, the amount of the reduction will be added back to the stated capital account (or the portion thereof that is permitted to be added back under Canadian federal income tax legislation will be so added) in the future in accordance with procedures contained in the ABCA. Such add back would be intended to be effected prior to implementation of any transaction where the previous reduction of stated capital could have an adverse impact on shareholders or the Company. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effect the add back, or that the amount added back will avoid any adverse tax consequences to shareholders or the Company.\nWe believe that we will be a \u201cpassive foreign investment company,\u201d or PFIC, for the current taxable year, which could subject certain U.S. investors to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nWe believe we were classified as a PFIC during our taxable year ended December 31, 2021, and based on current business plans and financial expectations, we believe we may be a PFIC for the current and future taxable years. If we are a PFIC for any year in which you hold common shares and you are a U.S. holder, then you generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of such common shares, or any so-called \u201cexcess distribution\u201d received on your common shares, as ordinary income, and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain or distribution. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the interest charge may exceed the total amount of proceeds you realize on the disposition or the amount of the excess distribution you receive. Subject to certain limitations, these tax consequences may be mitigated if you make a timely and effective Qualified Electing Fund election, or QEF Election, or a mark-to-market election, or Mark-to-Market Election. Subject to certain limitations, such elections may be made with respect to our common shares. If you are a U.S. holder and make a timely and effective QEF Election, you generally must report on a current basis your share of our net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which we are a PFIC, whether or not we distribute any amount to you, thus giving rise to so-called \u201cphantom income\u201d and to a potential tax liability. However, U.S. holders should be aware that we do not intend to satisfy the record keeping requirements that apply to a \u201cqualified electing fund,\u201d or supply U.S. holders with information that such U.S. holders require to report under the QEF Election rules, in the event that we are a PFIC and a U.S. holder wishes to make a QEF Election. Thus, if you are a U.S. holder, you may not be able to make a QEF Election. If you are a U.S. Holder and make a timely and effective Mark-to-Market Election, you generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of your common shares over your tax basis therein, thus also possibly giving rise to phantom income and a potential tax liability. Ordinary loss generally is recognized only to the extent of net mark-to-market gains previously included in income. Any holder of our common shares who is a U.S. taxpayer should consult its own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our common shares.\nIf the Internal Revenue Service determines that we are not a PFIC and you previously paid taxes pursuant to a QEF Election or a Mark-to- Market Election, you may pay more taxes than you legally owe.\nIf the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, makes a determination that we are not a PFIC and you previously paid taxes pursuant to a QEF Election or Mark-to-Market Election, then you may have paid more taxes than you legally owed due to such election. If you do not, or are unable to, file a refund claim before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, you will not be able to claim a refund for those taxes.", "PERMNO": 17103, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ZOM"}
