{"cik": "317889", "company": "Bulova Technologies Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-01-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, including \u201cPart II - Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could in turn materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nBrokerage of Small Caliber Ammunition Commercial Sales\nThe Brokerage business is dependent entirely upon both a strong U.S. demand and a lack of availability from U.S. manufacturers.\nWhile the demand for small caliber commercial ammunition has been especially strong in the past 2-4 years in the U.S. and remains so, there can be no assurance that the market will continue to remain so. Without such demand, sales would drop precipitously. Similarly, should U.S. manufacturers increase production to a greater level and meet the increased U.S. demand, the import of Eastern European ammunition would also likely be affected adversely.\nThe importation of ammunition manufactured abroad could be affected by future U.S. regulations.\nWhile Europe holds all licenses required to import ammunition from Eastern Europe, there can be no assurance that regulations might not be adopted in the future which could affect either the ability of Europe to import such ammunition or the price to Europe of such ammunition, in which case either Eastern European ammunition would become unavailable for import by Europe, or make such ammunition too costly to sell in the U.S.\nMachine Tool Business Commercial Sales\nBTM competes with much larger producers of machine tools products.\nThe machine tool product business is highly competitive and BTM competes against much larger entities with very strong resources and competitive pricing. There can be no assurance that BTM will succeed in its competition with such entities.\nThe machine tool business is subject to economic perturbations and foreign competition.\nWhile there are more than 196,000 machine shops in the U.S. which utilize machine tool equipment, the businesses utilizing machine tools and, consequently, the sellers of machine tool equipment in the U.S. are subject to general economic perturbations as well as foreign competition. Factors such as the demand for products manufactured by machine tool shops, the availability of credit to machine tool purchasers and the competition machine tool manufacturer\u2019s face from foreign manufacturers could adversely impact the sale of machine tools by BTM.\nTransportation and Storage of Freight\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nNumerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe compete with other transportation service providers of varying sizes, some of which may have more equipment, a broader global network, a wider range of services, greater capital resources or other competitive advantages;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain revenue;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to continue to collect fuel surcharges or our fuel surcharge program may become ineffective in mitigating the impact of fluctuating costs for fuel and other petroleum-based products;\n\u2022\nmany customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved transportation service providers and we may not be selected;\n\u2022\nmany customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors;\n\u2022\nsome shippers may choose to acquire their own trucking fleet or may choose to increase the volume of freight they transport if they have an existing trucking fleet;\n\u2022\nsome customers may choose to consolidate certain LTL shipments through a different mode of transportation, such as truckload, intermodal or rail;\n\u2022\na trend towards consolidation in the ground transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size;\n\u2022\nadvances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments; and\n\u2022\ncompetition from non-asset-based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and ability to maintain sufficient pricing.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete with other LTL carriers, whether on the basis of price, service or otherwise, we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated LTL industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired.\nNone of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement. From time to time there may be efforts to organize our employees. There is no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future, particularly if legislation is passed that facilitates unionization, such as the Employee Free Choice Act. The unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations because:\n\u25cf\nSome shippers have indicated that they intend to limit their use of unionized trucking companies because of the threat of strikes and other work stoppages;\n\u25cf\nRestrictive work rules could hamper our efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency;\n\u25cf\nRestrictive work rules could impair our service reputation and limit our ability to provide next-day services;\n\u25cf\nA strike or work stoppage would negatively impact our profitability and could damage customer and employee relationships; and\n\u25cf\nAn election and bargaining process could divert management\u2019s time and attention from our overall objectives and impose significant expenses.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability.\nWe are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage, property, damage, personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, long-term disability and group health. We have insurance coverage with third-party insurance carriers, but retain or self-insure a portion of the risk associated with these claims. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Insurance companies may require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our self-insured retention. If these requirements increase, our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected. Our future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect our growth strategy to require a periodic reassessment or our insurance strategy, including self-insurance of a greater portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, as well as employees\u2019 health insurance under pending federal legislation, which we are unable to predict. We may also become responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims. With growth, we will be required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. We maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self-insure with licensed insurance carriers. Although we believe the aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. Insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including trucking companies. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could raise our self-insured retention when our policies are renewed. If these expenses increase, or if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, results of our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur customers and suppliers\u2019 business may be slow to recover from the most recent downturn in the world-wide economy and disruption of financial markets. We cannot predict the impact on the national and worldwide economy of an economic downturn.\nOur business is dependent on a number of general economic and business factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control, table terms, because of the disruptions to the capital and credit markets. These customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses, which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt. Economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity in particular year or quarter. Our suppliers\u2019 business levels have also been and may continue to be adversely affected by current economic conditions or financial constraints, which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment, parts and services critical to our operations. A significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations, increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers.\nWe may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel.\nWe require large amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors and to power the temperature-control units on our trailers. Fuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Fuel prices tend to fluctuate and prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political, economic and market factors that are beyond our control. We do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases. We depend primarily on fuel surcharges, auxiliary power units for our tractors, volume purchasing arrangements with truck stop chains and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals to control and recover our fuel expenses. We have no assurance that we will be able to collect fuel surcharges or enter into volume purchase agreements in the future. An increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes, or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, unless the increase is offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges charged to our customers. We continuously monitor the components of our pricing, including base freight rates and fuel surcharges, and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary. While we have historically been able to adjust our pricing to offset changes to the cost of diesel fuel, through changes to base rates and/or fuel surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future.\nIncreased prices, reduced productivity, and restricted availability of new revenue equipment could cause our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nPrices for new tractors have increased over the past few years, primarily as a result of higher commodity prices, better pricing power among equipment manufacturers, and government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines. We expect to continue to pay increased prices for revenue equipment and incur additional expenses and related financing costs for the foreseeable future. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors and trailers or if we have to pay increased prices for new revenue equipment.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather can adversely affect our profitability.\nOur tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and more equipment repairs. We can also suffer short-term impacts from weather-related events such as hurricanes, blizzards, ice-storms, and floods that could harm our results or make our results more volatile.\nShrinkage in the pool of eligible drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow.\nThe ongoing Comprehensive Safety Analysis, often referred to as CSA 2010, is projected to reduce the driver pool. Every driver receives a score based upon his or her individual performance in six categories, which are then combined into a single score, and this score is compared to the scores of all other drivers to determine how \u201csafe\u201d the driver is. Drivers with lower scores are less hirable or not hirable. A shortage of qualified drivers from time to time could cause us to temporarily under-utilize our fleet, face difficulty in this seems aged a bit meeting shipper demands and increase our compensation levels for drivers.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nThe USDOT and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and insurance requirements. Our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the USDOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of-service. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers\u2019 hours-of-service, ergonomics, or other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the EPA and the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, also regulate our equipment, operations, and drivers. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher prices could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSome states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors, such as ours, may idle, in order to reduce exhaust emissions. From time to time, various federal, state, or local taxes are increased, including taxes on fuels. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such increase applicable to us will be enacted, but such an increase could adversely affect our profitability.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe are subject to the risks of current and future legal proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nAt any given time, we are a defendant in various material legal proceedings and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation, claims and assessments that have been asserted against acquired businesses, which we have assumed. Although we maintain insurance policies, these policies may not be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims and these levels of insurance may not be available in the future at economical prices or at all. A significant judgment against us, arising out of any of our current or future legal proceedings and litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOn July 14, 2017 a truck owned by Twiss Transport, Inc. (\u201cTwiss\u201d) and driven by a Twiss employee was involved in a fatal accident in Marion County, Florida. Twiss, BT Twiss and the Company have been sued in both federal court in Pennsylvania and state court in Florida by the injured parties and the estate of the deceased. No damages have yet been specified and the defendants are vigorously defending the claims. All three defendants have notified the applicable insurance carrier.\nWe are indirectly involved, through Ordnance, in legal proceedings involving the termination of a DoD contract which took place in July 2011. (See Part 3, Legal Proceedings).\nOur level of debt and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or ability to incur additional debt.\nCommencing with our January 1, 2009 acquisition of 3Si Holdings, Inc., we assumed certain amounts of indebtedness associated with the business operations acquired. Subsequently, we incurred additional debt with high interest rates that have hindered the Company financially.\nIn October 2012, we sold substantially all of the assets of Bulova Technologies Ordnance Systems LLC, and settled significant indebtedness.\nIn July of 2013, we entered into the machine tool business, importing industrial machine tools and related equipment from international sources. In establishing this new line of business, we incurred certain debt to facilitate the cultivation and marketing of a distributor / dealer network.\nIn January 2016 and again in July 2017, through significant acquisitions, we expanded into the freight transportation, logistics and storage businesses, making substantial investments and incurring significant amounts of debt for both equipment acquisitions and working capital.\nAt September 30, 2017, we have outstanding debt of approximately 38.6 million to support our operations and cash flow needs.\nIn the future, we may need to increase our borrowings, subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. Further discussion concerning the sale of these assets and any remaining scheduled maturities of our outstanding debt, is included in Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\n.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to refinance our existing debt, including the scheduled maturities of our outstanding debt, depends on our future financial performance as well as our ability to access the capital markets, and the relative attractiveness of available financing terms. We do not have complete control over our future financial performance because it is subject to economic, political, financial (including credit market conditions), competitive, regulatory and other factors affecting the defense industry, as well as commercial industries in which we operate. It is possible that in the future our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If this situation occurs, we may have to reduce costs and expenses, sell assets, restructure debt or obtain additional equity capital. We may not be able to do so in a timely manner or upon acceptable terms in accordance with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements.\nOur level of indebtedness has important consequences to us. These consequences may include:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our net cash flow from operations to be used to pay interest and principal on our debt and therefore be unavailable for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, paying dividends to our shareholders, repurchasing shares of our common stock, research and development and other investments;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, investments or other expenditures, which, in each case, may limit our ability to carry out our acquisition strategy;\n\u2022\nincreasing interest expenses due to higher interest rates on our borrowings that have variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nheightening our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in the general economy and restricting us from making acquisitions, introducing new technologies and products or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nimpacting debt covenants that limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, or repurchase shares of our common stock. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liability.\nOur operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations.\nNew laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements may require us to incur a significant amount of additional costs in the future and could decrease the amount of free cash flow available to us for other purposes, including capital expenditures, research and development and other investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nGlobal economic recession, continued tightening of credit markets, and U.S. Government intervention in financial and other industries may adversely affect our results.\nDomestic and foreign economies and equity and fixed income markets have recently experienced significant declines, and severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. These economic conditions are currently negatively impacting, and could continue to adversely affect, our sales to the commercial markets in which we operate, including our contract manufacturing business.\nAdditionally, while we are unable to predict the impact and outcome of these economic events and the U.S. Government\u2019s intervention to shore up financial and other industries, these events could also negatively affect future U.S. defense budgets and spending and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 77703, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "BTGI"}
