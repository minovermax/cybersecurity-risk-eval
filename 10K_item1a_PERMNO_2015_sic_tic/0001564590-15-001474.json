{"cik": "1017907", "company": "FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in the Company involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the Company. This information should be considered together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time.\nOur business may be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions and other negative developments in the non-standard personal automobile insurance industry.\nSubstantially all of our gross premiums written are generated from sales of non-standard personal automobile insurance policies. As a result of our concentration in this line of business, negative developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the non-standard personal automobile insurance industry and our customers could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Weak economic conditions, elevated unemployment levels, and low consumer confidence in the United States tend to result in fewer customers purchasing and maintaining non-standard personal automobile insurance policies and certain customers reducing their insurance coverage, which adversely impacts our revenues and profitability. Developments affecting the non-standard personal automobile insurance industry and our customers could have a greater effect on us compared with more diversified insurers that also sell other types of automobile insurance products or write other additional lines of insurance.\nOur results may fluctuate as a result of cyclical changes in the non-standard personal automobile insurance industry.\nThe non-standard personal automobile insurance industry is cyclical in nature. Likewise, adverse economic conditions impact our customers and many will choose to reduce their coverage or go uninsured during a weak economy. Employment rates, sales of used vehicles, consumer confidence and other factors affect our customers\u2019 purchasing habits. In the past, the industry has also been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. If new competitors enter the market, existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates. Such conditions could lead to reduced prices, which would negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Given the cyclical nature of the industry and the economy, these conditions may negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nDue to our largely fixed cost structure, our profitability may decline if our sales volume declines significantly.\nOur reliance on leased retail locations and a call center staffed by employee-agents results in a cost structure that has a high proportion of fixed costs as compared with other more traditional insurers. In times of increasing sales volume, our acquisition cost per policy decreases, improving our expense ratio, which we believe is one of the significant advantages of our business model. However, in times of declining sales volume, the opposite occurs. Decreases in our sales volume, without corresponding decreases in our costs, would adversely impact our results of operations and profitability.\nOur loss and loss adjustment expenses may exceed our reserves, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe establish reserves for the estimated amount of claims under the terms of the insurance policies underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries. The amount of the reserves is determined based on historical claims information, industry statistics and other factors. The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process due to a number of factors, including the difficulty in predicting the frequency and severity of claims, the rate of inflation, changes in trends, ongoing interpretation of insurance policy provisions by courts, inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and broader theories of liability. Any changes in claims settlement practices can also lead to changes in loss payment patterns, which are used to estimate reserve levels. Our ability to accurately estimate our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves may be made more difficult by changes in our business, including entry into new markets, changes in sales practices, or changes in our customers\u2019 purchasing habits. If our reserves prove to be inadequate, we will be required to increase our loss reserves and the amount of any such increase would reduce our income in the period that the deficiency is recognized. The historic development of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses may not necessarily reflect future trends in the development of these amounts. Consequently, our actual losses could materially exceed our loss reserves, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K\nExtra-contractual losses arising from bad faith claims could materially reduce our profitability.\nIn Florida, Georgia, and other states where we have substantial operations, the judicial climate, case law or statutory framework are often viewed as unfavorable toward an insurer in litigation brought against it by policyholders and third-party claimants. This tends to increase our exposure to extra-contractual losses, or monetary damages beyond policy limits, in what are known as \u201cbad faith\u201d claims, for which reinsurance may be unavailable. Such claims may result in losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or other-than-temporary impairment losses, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur results of operations depend, in part, on the performance of our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2014, the majority of our investments available-for-sale portfolio was invested either directly or indirectly in marketable, investment-grade debt securities and mutual funds, and included U.S. government securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations. Declines in interest rates over the past few years have reduced the available returns on the reinvestment of securities in the portfolio as they mature or are redeemed. However, as rates have declined, the fair value of debt securities has increased above its amortized cost resulting in net unrealized gains on debt securities. Such gains are recognized in other comprehensive income and increased our stockholders\u2019 equity. At December 31, 2014, the fair value of our investment portfolio exceeded the amortized cost by approximately $6.0 million. An increase in interest rates could reduce the fair value of our investments in debt securities. At December 31, 2014, the impact of an immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates on our fixed maturities portfolio would have resulted in an estimated decrease in fair value of 4.9%, or approximately $5.6 million. In response to the decline in interest rates, we have also made certain \u201cOther Investments\u201d that are not readily marketable and have restrictions as to their redemption. Defaults by third parties who fail to pay or perform obligations could reduce our investment income and could also result in investment losses to our portfolio. See \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates - Investments\u201d in Item 7 of this report and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements regarding determination of other-than-temporary impairment losses on investment securities and for further information about our \u201cOther Investments.\u201d\nOur business may be adversely affected by negative developments in the states in which we operate.\nWe currently operate in 13 states located primarily in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 76% of our premiums earned were generated from insurance policies written in six states. Our revenues and profitability are affected by prevailing economic, demographic, regulatory, competitive and other conditions in the states in which we operate. Changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct business. Adverse regulatory developments, which could include reductions in the maximum rates permitted to be charged, restrictions on rate increases, fundamental changes to the design or implementation of the automobile insurance regulatory framework, or economic conditions that result in fewer customers purchasing or maintaining insurance (or purchasing or maintaining reduced coverages), could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These developments could have a greater effect on us, as compared with more diversified insurers that also sell other types of automobile insurance products, write other additional lines of insurance coverages or whose premiums are not concentrated in a single line of insurance.\nOur business is highly competitive, which may make it difficult for us to market our core products effectively and profitably.\nThe non-standard personal automobile insurance business is highly competitive. Our primary insurance company competition comes not only from national insurance companies or their subsidiaries, but also from non-standard insurers and independent agents that operate in a specific region or single state in which we also operate. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, and they may offer a broader range of products or competing products at lower prices, and may offer products through multiple distribution channels. Our revenues, profitability and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are required to decrease or are unable to increase prices to stay competitive, or if we do not successfully retain our current customers and attract new customers.\nIn addition, innovation by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. This can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technology advances, or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer\u2019s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. Our ability to react to such advances and navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success.\nFIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K\nOur ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers and employee-agents. Our loss of certain key employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. In addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our business) in one or more locations. In either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, and brand could be materially adversely affected.\nPricing, claim and coverage issues and class action litigation are continually emerging in the automobile insurance industry, and these issues could adversely impact our revenues, profitability, or our methods of doing business.\nAs automobile insurance industry practices and regulatory, judicial and consumer conditions change, litigation and unexpected and unintended issues related to claims, coverages and business practices may emerge. These issues can have an adverse effect on our business by subjecting us to liability, changing the way we price and market our products, extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent, requiring us to obtain additional licenses or increasing the size of claims. Examples of some issues include:\n\u00b7\nconcerns over the use of an applicant\u2019s insurance score or zip code as a factor in making risk selections and pricing decisions; and\n\u00b7\nplaintiffs targeting automobile insurers in putative class action litigation relating to sales and marketing practices and claims-handling practices, such as total loss evaluation methodology, the use of aftermarket (non-original equipment manufacturer) parts and the alleged diminution in value to insureds\u2019 vehicles involved in accidents.\nThe effects of these and other unforeseen emerging issues could subject us to liability or negatively affect our revenues, profitability, or our methods of doing business.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we do not underwrite risks accurately and charge adequate rates to policyholders.\nOur financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. The role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. Pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products and in many different markets. As a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nthe availability of sufficient reliable data;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally;\n\u00b7\nour ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data;\n\u00b7\nour ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy;\n\u00b7\nour ability to predict changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable accuracy;\n\u00b7\nthe development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nour ability to predict policyholder retention accurately;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory action;\n\u00b7\nthe occurrence and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, other severe weather, and terrorist events;\n\u00b7\nour understanding of the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices; and\nFIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K\n\u00b7\nchanging driving patterns.\nThe realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. In either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the surplus of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business.\nOur results are dependent on our ability to adjust claims accurately.\nWe must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. Many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims, the effectiveness of our management, and our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions. Our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity.\nOur insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on paying dividends to our holding company.\nOur holding company may in the future, rely in part, on receiving dividends from the insurance company subsidiaries to pay its obligations. State insurance laws limit the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends and require our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. These restrictions affect the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company and may require our subsidiaries to obtain the prior approval of regulatory authorities, which could slow the timing of such payments or reduce the amount that can be paid. The limits on the amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries may affect the ability of our holding company to pay its obligations. The current dividend-paying ability of the insurance company subsidiaries is discussed in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur insurance company subsidiaries are subject to statutory capital and surplus requirements and other standards, and their failure to meet these requirements or standards could subject them to regulatory actions.\nOur insurance company subsidiaries are subject to RBC standards and other minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of their respective states of domicile. The RBC standards, which are based upon the RBC Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require our insurance company subsidiaries to annually report their results of RBC calculations to the state departments of insurance and the NAIC.\nFailure to meet applicable RBC requirements or minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements could subject our insurance company subsidiaries to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on their writing of additional business, state supervision or even liquidation. Any changes in existing RBC standards or minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements may require our insurance company subsidiaries to increase their statutory capital and surplus levels, which they may be unable to do. These calculations are performed on a calendar year basis, and at December 31, 2014, our insurance company subsidiaries maintained RBC levels in excess of an amount that would require any corrective actions on their part.\nState regulators also screen and analyze the financial condition of insurance companies using the NAIC IRIS system. As part of IRIS, the NAIC database generates key financial ratio results obtained from an insurer\u2019s annual statutory statements. A ratio result falling outside the defined range of IRIS ratios may result in further examination by a state regulator to determine if corrective action is necessary. At December 31, 2014, each of our three insurance company subsidiaries had IRIS ratios outside the defined ranges. We cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not conduct any such examination of the financial condition of our insurance company subsidiaries, or of the outcome of any such investigation. See \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nWe rely on our information technology and communication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on the proprietary integrated technology systems that enable timely and efficient communication and data sharing among the various segments of our integrated operations. These systems are used in all our operations, including price\nFIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K\nquotation, policy issuance, customer service, underwriting, claims, accounting, communications, and the maintenance of our consumer-based website and mobile platform. We have a technical staff that develops, maintains and supports all elements of our technology infrastructure. However, disruption of power systems or communication systems or any failure of our systems could result in deterioration in our ability to respond to customers\u2019 requests, write and service new business, and process claims in a timely manner. We believe we have appropriate types and levels of insurance to protect our real property, systems, and other assets. However, insurance does not provide full reimbursement for all losses, both direct and indirect, that may result from an event affecting our information technology and communication systems.\nSevere weather conditions and other catastrophes may result in an increase in the number and amount of claims filed against us.\nOur business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including natural events, such as severe winter weather, hurricanes, tornados, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, thunderstorms and fires, and other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks and riots. The incidence and severity of catastrophes and severe weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. Severe weather conditions generally result in more automobile accidents and damage, leading to an increase in the number of claims filed and/or the amount of compensation sought by claimants.\nA single stockholder family has significant control over us, and his interests may differ from yours.\nA single stockholder family, Gerald J. Ford, our former Chairman of the Board and his son, our current Chairman, together control approximately 59% of our outstanding common stock. Together, they have the power to control the election and removal of our directors. They would also have significant control over other matters requiring stockholder approval, including the approval of major corporate transactions and proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation. This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, as well as frustrate attempts to replace or remove current management, even when a change may be in the best interests of our other stockholders. Furthermore, their interests may not always coincide with the interests of the Company or other stockholders.\nWe may have difficulties in managing any expansion through new markets, products or distribution methods.\nOur future growth plans may include expanding into new states or introducing additional insurance products or distribution methods. In order to grow our business successfully, we must apply for and maintain necessary licenses, properly design and price our products and identify, hire and train new employees. Our expansion would also place significant demands on our existing management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. Any failure by us to manage growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in integrating any acquisitions into our operations, which could harm our financial results.\nIn order to grow our business by acquisition, we must identify acquisition candidates and integrate the acquired operations. If we do acquire additional companies or businesses, we could face increased costs, or, if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business into our operations, we could experience disruption of our business and distraction of our management, which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenues. The integration of operations after an acquisition is subject to risks, including, among others, loss of key personnel of the acquired company, difficulty associated with assimilating the personnel and operations of the acquired company, potential disruption of ongoing business, maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies and impairment of the acquired company\u2019s reputation and relationships with its employees and clients. Any of these may result in the loss of customers. It is also possible that we may not realize, either at all or in a timely manner, any or all benefits from recent and future acquisitions and may incur significant costs in connection with these acquisitions. Failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions could materially adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision that may restrict our ability to earn profits.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by the insurance departments in the states where our subsidiaries are domiciled and where our subsidiaries sell insurance and ancillary products, issue policies and handle claims. Certain regulatory restrictions and prior approval requirements may affect our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to operate, change their operations or obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or may increase our costs and reduce profitability.\nAmong other things, regulation and supervision of us and our subsidiaries extends to:\nRequired Licensing. We and our subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses govern, among other things, the types of insurance coverages, agency and claims services and motor club products that we and our\nFIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K\nsubsidiaries may offer consumers in the particular state. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting any such license, our ability to enter new markets or offer new products could be substantially impaired.\nTransactions Between Insurance Companies and Their Affiliates. Our insurance company subsidiaries are organized and domiciled under the insurance statutes of Texas, Georgia and Tennessee. The insurance laws in these states provide that all transactions among members of an insurance holding company system must be done at arm\u2019s length and shown to be fair and reasonable to the regulated insurer. Transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries generally must be disclosed to the state regulators, and prior approval of the applicable regulator generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated. State regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of such a transaction, which may impact our ability to innovate or operate efficiently.\nRegulation of Rates and Policy Forms. The insurance laws of most states in which our insurance company subsidiaries operate require insurance companies to file premium rate schedules and policy forms for review and approval. State insurance regulators have broad discretion in judging whether our rates are adequate, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory. The speed at which we can change our rates in response to market conditions or increasing costs depends, in part, on the method by which the applicable state\u2019s rating laws are administered. Generally, state insurance regulators have the authority to disapprove our requested rates. If as permitted in some states, we begin using new rates before they are approved, we may be required to issue premium refunds or credits to our policyholders if the new rates are ultimately disapproved by the applicable state regulator. In some states, there has been pressure in past years to reduce premium rates for automobile and other personal insurance or to limit how often an insurer may request increases for such rates. In states where such pressure is applied, our ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state may be adversely affected.\nInvestment Restrictions. Our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and that limit the amount of investments in certain categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture. If a non-conforming asset is treated as a non-admitted asset, it would lower the affected subsidiary\u2019s surplus and thus, its ability to write additional premiums and pay dividends.\nRestrictions on Cancellation, Non-Renewal or Withdrawal. Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer\u2019s ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer\u2019s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business in the state, except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. These laws and regulations that limit cancellations and non-renewals and that subject business withdrawals to prior approval restrictions could limit our ability to exit unprofitable markets or discontinue unprofitable products in the future.\nOur success depends partly on our ability to efficiently manage complexity in our business operations.\nThe fast pace of change and innovation in our business, combined with ongoing technological, regulatory, and other developments, results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. The complexity may create a barrier to implementing certain new ideas, and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies, as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources (such as information technology resources) for multiple potential initiatives or projects. Our inability to manage this complexity effectively, to bring new ideas to market, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors could result in substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, regulatory investigations and sanctions, poor customer experiences, and damage to our brand.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent a takeover or a change in management that you may deem favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions that could prevent or inhibit a third party from acquiring us:\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that only stockholders owning at least one-third of the outstanding shares of our common stock may call a special stockholders\u2019 meeting; and\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that stockholders owning at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock must approve any amendment to our certificate of incorporation provisions concerning the ability to call special stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, we may issue shares of preferred stock on terms that are unfavorable to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could also prevent or inhibit a third party from acquiring us. The existence of\nFIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K\nthese provisions could depress the price of our common stock, could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or could prevent attempts to replace or remove incumbent management.\nOur failure to maintain security to prevent unauthorized access to confidential electronic information could result in a data breach that may negatively impact our business.\nWe are dependent upon automated information technology processes. A portion of our business operations is conducted over the Internet which increases the risk of improper third party attacks that could cause system failures and disruptions of operations. In addition, any failure to maintain the security of confidential information belonging to our customers could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of customers\u2019 confidence in us, and subject us to potential liabilities resulting from litigation, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nImproper third party attacks may also result in a breach of our card and bank payment processes. Such breaches could cause interruptions to our operations, damage to our reputation and our customers\u2019 willingness to purchase insurance from us, and subject us to additional potential liabilities resulting from litigation, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may increase our deferred tax asset valuation allowance or write-off intangible assets.\nOur consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014 contained a net deferred tax asset of $16.5 million. Realization of this asset is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in the future. If circumstances change, and we no longer believe that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the deferred tax asset, an increase in our deferred tax valuation allowance may occur. The amount of any increase in our deferred tax valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which any write-off occurs.\nAs a result of purchase accounting from a business combination transaction, our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014 contained intangible assets designated as other identifiable intangible assets totaling $4.8 million. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of value of intangible assets. As circumstances change, we cannot assure you that the value of these intangible assets will be realized by us. If we determine that a material impairment has occurred, we will be required to write-off the impaired portion of intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.", "PERMNO": 54578, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "FACO"}
