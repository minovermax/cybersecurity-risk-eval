{"cik": "1606757", "company": "Kimball Electronics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following important risk factors, among others, could affect future results and events, causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be carefully considered. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about, we currently believe are immaterial or we have not predicted may also affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nUncertain macroeconomic and industry conditions could adversely impact demand for our products and services and adversely affect operating results.\nMarket demand for our products and services, which impacts revenues and gross profit, is influenced by a variety of economic and industry factors such as:\n\u2022\ninstability of the global financial markets;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022\nerosion of global consumer confidence;\n\u2022\ngeneral corporate profitability of Kimball Electronics\u2019 end markets;\n\u2022\ncredit availability to Kimball Electronics\u2019 end markets;\n\u2022\ndemand fluctuations in the industries we currently serve, including automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety;\n\u2022\ndemand for end-user products which include electronic assembly components produced by Kimball Electronics;\n\u2022\nexcess capacity in the industries in which Kimball Electronics competes; and\n\u2022\nchanges in customer order patterns, including changes in product quantities, delays in orders, or cancellation of orders.\nWe must make decisions based on order volumes in order to achieve efficiency in manufacturing capacities. These decisions include determining what level of additional business to accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, and personnel requirements, among various other considerations. We must constantly monitor the changing economic landscape and may modify our strategic direction based upon the changing business environment. If we do not react quickly enough to the changes in market or economic conditions, it could result in lost customers, decreased market share, and increased operating costs.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers that have been adversely affected by the instability of market conditions.\nThe instability of market conditions drives an elevated risk of potential bankruptcy of customers resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible outstanding accounts receivable. Accordingly, we intensely monitor our receivables and related credit risks. The realization of these risks could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nReduction of purchases by or the loss of one or more key customers could reduce revenues and profitability.\nLosses of key contract customers within specific industries or significant volume reductions from key contract customers are both risks. If a current customer of Kimball Electronics merges with or is acquired by a party that currently is aligned with a competitor, or the combination creates excess capacity, we could lose future revenues. Our continuing success is dependent upon replacing expiring contract customers/programs with new customers/programs. See \u201cCustomers\u201d in Item 1 - Business for disclosure of the net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales for each of our significant customers during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013. Regardless of whether our agreements with our customers, including our significant customers, have a definite term, our customers typically do not have an obligation to purchase a minimum quantity of products or services as individual purchase orders or other product or project specific documentation are typically entered into from time to time. Our customers generally have the right to cancel a particular product, subject to contractual provisions governing the final product runs, excess or obsolete inventory, and end-of-life pricing. As such, our ability to continue the relationships with such customers is uncertain.\nFor example, as previously announced, volumes with Johnson Controls, Inc. (\u201cJCI\u201d) have declined in the current fiscal year due to certain JCI programs reaching end-of-life and JCI\u2019s decision to in-source other programs. Volumes for one of our largest contracts with JCI, which accounted for approximately $46 million in net sales in fiscal year 2014, declined in fiscal year 2015 to $6 million. The reason for such decline in volume is that certain JCI programs have reached end-of-life. In addition, due to its available capacity, JCI decided to in-source programs that have historically been manufactured by Kimball Electronics, which accounted for approximately $33 million in net sales in fiscal year 2014 and approximately $16 million in net sales during fiscal year 2015. The transition to JCI\u2019s in-sourcing occurred in stages and began in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 and is substantially complete. Significant declines in the level of purchases by JCI or other key customers or the loss of a\nsignificant number of customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the nature of the contract electronics manufacturing industry is such that the start-up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently, and new customer and program start-ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fully replace any lost sales, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully.\nNumerous manufacturers within the EMS industry compete globally for business from existing and potential customers. Some of our competitors have greater resources and more geographically diversified international operations than we do. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing to EMS providers. The competition may further intensify as more companies enter the markets in which we operate, as existing competitors expand capacity and as the industry consolidates.\nIn relation to customer pricing pressures, if we cannot achieve the proportionate reductions in costs, profit margins may suffer. The high level of competition in the industry impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which also could lower profit margins. In addition, as end markets dictate, we are continually assessing excess capacity and developing plans to better utilize manufacturing operations, including consolidating and shifting manufacturing capacity to lower cost venues as necessary.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. Among other things, we will not be required to (1) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) comply with any new rules that may be adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (3) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, (4) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, (5) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies, or (6) hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtain Share Owner approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Accordingly, the information that we provide Share Owners in this annual report and in our other filings with the SEC may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. The election to comply with these public company effective dates is irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act or any successor statute, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period, and (4) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act.\nWe may be unable to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components for use in our products at competitive prices, in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe depend on suppliers globally to provide timely delivery of materials, parts, and components for use in our products. The financial stability of suppliers is monitored by Kimball Electronics when feasible as the loss of a significant supplier could have an adverse impact on our operations. Suppliers adjust their capacity as demand fluctuates, and component shortages and/or component allocations could occur. Certain components purchased by Kimball Electronics are primarily manufactured in select regions of the world and issues in those regions could cause manufacturing delays. Maintaining strong relationships with key suppliers of components critical to the manufacturing process is essential. Price increases of commodity components could\nhave an adverse impact on our profitability if we cannot offset such increases with other cost reductions or by price increases to customers. Materials utilized by Kimball Electronics are generally available, but future availability is unknown and could impact our ability to meet customer order requirements. If suppliers fail to meet commitments to Kimball Electronics in terms of price, delivery, or quality, it could interrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of fuel and other energy sources.\nThe cost of energy is a critical component of freight expense and the cost of operating manufacturing facilities. Increases in the cost of energy could reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to manufacturing inefficiencies due to startup of new programs, transfer of production, and other factors.\nAt times, we may experience labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to factors such as start-up of new programs, transfers of production among our manufacturing facilities, a sudden decline in sales, a new operating system, or turnover in personnel. Manufacturing inefficiencies could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nA change in our sales mix among various products could have a negative impact on the gross profit margin.\nChanges in product sales mix could negatively impact our gross margin as margins of different products vary. We strive to improve the margins of all products, but certain products have lower margins in order to price the product competitively or in connection with the start-up of a new program. An increase in the proportion of sales of products with lower margins could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur future restructuring efforts may not be successful.\nWe continually evaluate our manufacturing capabilities and capacities in relation to current and anticipated market conditions. If we implement restructuring plans in the future, the successful execution of those restructuring initiatives will be dependent on various factors and may not be accomplished as quickly or effectively as anticipated.\nWe will face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions.\nOur sales growth plans may occur through both organic growth and acquisitions. Acquisitions involve many risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying suitable acquisition candidates and in negotiating and consummating acquisitions on terms attractive to us;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the operations of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of resources, including diverting management\u2019s attention from our current operations;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering new geographic or product markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key customers of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe potential incurrence of indebtedness to fund the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe potential issuance of common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute ownership interests of our current Share Owners;\n\u2022\nthe acquired business not achieving anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flow, or market share;\n\u2022\nexcess capacity;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of undisclosed liabilities; and\n\u2022\ndilution of earnings.\nWe may not be successful in launching start-up operations.\nWe are committed to growing our business, and therefore from time to time, we may determine that it would be in our best interests to start up a new operation. Start-up operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties, such as funding the capital expenditures related to the start-up operation, developing a management team for the new operation, diversion of management focus away from current operations, and creation of excess capacity. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf efforts to start-up new programs are not successful, this could limit sales growth or cause sales to decline.\nThe start-up of new programs requires the coordination of the design and manufacturing processes. The design and engineering required for certain new programs can take an extended period of time, and further time may be required to achieve customer acceptance. Accordingly, the launch of any particular program may be delayed or may be less successful than we originally anticipated. Difficulties or delays in starting up new programs or lack of customer acceptance of such programs could limit sales growth or cause sales to decline. We depend on industries that utilize technologically advanced electronic components\nwhich often have short life cycles. We must continue to invest in advanced equipment and product development to remain competitive in this area.\nOur international operations involve financial and operational risks.\nWe have operations outside the United States, primarily in China, Thailand, Poland, and Mexico, and we will have a start-up operation in Romania in fiscal year 2016. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, which may include the following:\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability;\n\u2022\nwarfare, riots, terrorism, and other forms of violence or geopolitical disruption;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, applicable to U.S. companies doing business outside the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences including the manner in which multinational companies are taxed in the U.S.; and\n\u2022\nforeign labor practices.\nThese risks could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates could impact our operating results. Our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures. Any hedging techniques we implement contain risks and may not be entirely effective. Exchange rate fluctuations could also make our products more expensive than competitors\u2019 products not subject to these fluctuations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in international markets.\nIf customers do not perceive our engineering and manufacturing services to be innovative and of high quality, our reputation could suffer.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business. Promotion and enhancement of our name will depend on the effectiveness of marketing and advertising efforts and on successfully providing innovative and high quality electronic engineering and manufacturing services. If customers do not perceive our services to be innovative and of high quality, our reputation could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to effectively manage working capital may adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe closely monitor inventory and receivable efficiencies and continuously strive to improve these measures of working capital, but customer financial difficulties, cancellation or delay of customer orders, shifts in customer payment practices, transfers of production among our manufacturing facilities, or manufacturing delays could adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe may not be able to achieve maximum utilization of our manufacturing capacity.\nMost of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules and we are unable to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty over a given period of time. As a result, at times it can be difficult for us to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Fluctuations and deferrals of customer orders may have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize our fixed capacity and thus negatively impact our operating margins.\nWe could incur losses due to asset impairment.\nAs business conditions change, we must continually evaluate and work toward the optimum asset base. It is possible that certain assets such as, but not limited to, facilities, equipment, intangible assets, or goodwill could be impaired at some point in the future depending on changing business conditions. Such impairment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe mix of pre-tax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate that have varying tax rates could impact our effective tax rate. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, other tax liabilities, interest, and penalties. Future events could change management\u2019s assessment. We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We have also made assumptions about the realization of deferred tax assets. Changes in these assumptions could result in a valuation allowance for these assets. Final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is currently reflected by our income tax provisions and accruals.\nA failure to comply with the financial covenants under the Company\u2019s $50 million credit facility could adversely impact the Company.\nOur credit facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants. We believe the most significant covenants under this credit facility are the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unencumbered U.S. cash on hand in the U.S. in excess of $15 million to adjusted consolidated EBITDA and the fixed charge coverage ratio. More detail on these financial covenants is discussed in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As of June 30, 2015, we had no short-term borrowings under this credit facility and had total cash and cash equivalents of $65.2 million. In the future, a default on the financial covenants under our credit facility could cause an increase in the borrowing rates or could make it more difficult for us to secure future financing which could adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.\nOur business may be harmed due to failure to successfully implement information technology solutions or a lack of reasonable safeguards to maintain data security.\nOur business depends on effective information technology systems which also are intended to minimize the risk of a security breach or cybersecurity threat, including the misappropriation of assets or other sensitive information, or data corruption which could cause operational disruption. Information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with changes in information processing technology and evolving industry standards. Implementation delays, poor execution, or a breach of information technology systems could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or increase costs related to the mitigation of, response to, or litigation arising from any such issue.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could undermine our competitive position.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party non-disclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States, and therefore in some parts of the world, we have limited protections, if any, for our intellectual property. Competing effectively depends, to a significant extent, on maintaining the proprietary nature of our intellectual property.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their intellectual property rights and incur substantial litigation or other costs.\nWe could be notified of a claim regarding intellectual property rights which could lead to Kimball Electronics spending time and money to defend or address the claim. Even if the claim is without merit, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nOur insurance may not adequately protect us from liabilities related to product defects.\nWe maintain product liability and other insurance coverage that we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices. However, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial claims and costs that may arise from liabilities related to product defects, particularly if we have a large number of defective products or if the root cause is disputed.\nOur failure to maintain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registration of one or more of our registered manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our ability to produce products for our customers in the medical industry.\nTo maintain FDA registration, Kimball Electronics is subject to FDA audits of the manufacturing process. FDA audit failure could result in a partial or total suspension of production, fines, or criminal prosecution. Failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our reputation in addition to an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and significant potential environmental liabilities.\nThe past and present operation and ownership by Kimball Electronics of manufacturing plants and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the use of certain hazardous materials in the production of select products, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. In addition, the increased prevalence of global climate issues may result in new regulations that may negatively impact us. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require additional expenditures by Kimball\nElectronics, some of which could be material. In addition, any investigations or remedial efforts relating to environmental matters could involve material costs or otherwise result in material liabilities.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our key personnel.\nWe depend significantly on our executive officers and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any one of these executive officers or other key personnel may have an adverse effect on us.\nOur failure to retain the existing management team, maintain our engineering, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success is dependent on keeping pace with technological advancements and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities which meet customers\u2019 changing needs. In addition, we must retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner. Our culture and guiding principles focus on continuous training, motivating, and development of employees, and we strive to attract, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. Failure to retain and attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nTurnover in personnel could cause manufacturing inefficiencies.\nThe demand for manufacturing labor in certain geographic areas makes retaining experienced production employees difficult. Turnover could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could impact our operating results.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may impact our production schedules and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise our ability to produce or deliver products. Our manufacturing operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and oil, and governmental regulations may control the allocation of such fuels to Kimball Electronics. Employees are an integral part of our business and events such as a pandemic could reduce the availability of employees reporting for work. In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, catastrophic events, or the threat thereof, can adversely affect U.S. and world economies, and could result in delayed or lost sales of Kimball Electronics\u2019 products. In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customer orders, manufacture products, and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers. We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these matters, but such may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner to us in the event of such an interruption.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of federal securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Among other requirements, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We have expended and expect to continue to expend management time and resources maintaining documentation and testing internal control over financial reporting. This annual report does not include a report of management\u2019s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies. As an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we are excluded from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which otherwise would have required our auditors to formally attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot predict the outcome of testing in future periods. If we cannot maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d our independent registered public accounting firm cannot provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence and, in turn, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nImposition of government regulations may significantly increase our operating costs in the United States and abroad.\nLegislative and regulatory reforms by the U.S. federal and foreign governments could significantly impact the profitability of Kimball Electronics by burdening us with forced cost choices that cannot be recovered by increased pricing. For example:\n\u2022\nThe United States healthcare reform legislation passed in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012 is likely to increase our total healthcare and related administrative expenses as the provisions of the law become effective. Governmental changes or delays to the provisions may likewise drive changes in our implementation plan causing inefficiencies and increasing our implementation costs even further. The changes resulting from this healthcare reform legislation could have a significant impact on our employment practices in the U.S., our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) must be followed when producing defense related products for the U.S. government. A breach of these regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022\nForeign regulations are increasing in many areas such as data privacy, hazardous waste disposal, labor relations, and employment practices.\nProvisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to \u201cConflict Minerals\u201d may increase our costs and reduce our sales levels.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries that are believed to benefit armed groups. As a result, the SEC has adopted new due diligence, disclosure, and reporting requirements for companies which manufacture products that include components containing such minerals, regardless of whether the minerals are actually mined in the DRC or adjoining countries. Such regulations could decrease the availability and increase the prices of components used in our products, particularly if we choose (or are required by our customers) to source such components from different suppliers than we use now. In addition, as our supply chain is complex and the process to comply with the new SEC rules is cumbersome, the ongoing compliance process is both time-consuming and costly. We may face reduced sales if we are unable to timely verify the origins of minerals contained in the components included in our products, or supply disruptions if our due diligence process reveals that materials we source originate in the DRC or adjoining countries.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nIf the distribution does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, tax could be imposed on the Share Owners and former Parent and we may be required to indemnify former Parent for its tax.\nIn connection with the spin-off, former Parent received (i) a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) that the Parent stock unification will not cause Parent to recognize income or gain as a result of the distribution; and (ii) an opinion of Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP to the effect that the distribution satisfies the requirements to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Code. However, the validity of both the IRS ruling and the tax opinion is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions provided by former Parent and us in connection with obtaining the IRS ruling and the tax opinion, including with respect to post-spin-off operations and conduct of the parties. Neither former Parent nor we are aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause these statements or representations to be incomplete or untrue or cause the facts on which the opinion is based to be materially different from the facts at the time of the spin-off. However, if these representations and assumptions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of the business, then we will not be able to rely on the IRS ruling or the tax opinion.\nFurthermore, the tax opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. If, notwithstanding our receipt of the tax opinion, the spin-off is determined to be taxable, then (i) former Parent would be subject to tax as if it sold the Kimball Electronics common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value; and (ii) each Share Owner who received Kimball Electronics common stock would be treated as receiving a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Kimball Electronics common stock that would generally result in varied tax liabilities for each Share Owner depending on the facts and circumstances.\nEven if the spin-off does qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution will be taxable to former Parent (but not to former Parent Share Owners) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of the stock of either us or former Parent, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of the then-outstanding stock of either us or former Parent and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% Share Owners and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The resulting tax liability may have a material adverse effect on both our and former Parent\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement entered into in connection with the spin-off, (i) we agreed (a) not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to former Parent, including under Section 355(e) of the Code; and (b) to indemnify former Parent for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions; and (ii) former Parent agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions entered into by former Parent. In addition, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of former Parent\u2019s consolidated group at the time of the spin-off (including us and our subsidiaries) is jointly and severally liable for the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability if all or a portion of the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, and we have agreed to indemnify former Parent for a portion of certain tax liabilities\nincurred in connection with the spin-off under certain circumstances. These obligations may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company.\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To comply with these requirements, we may need to upgrade our systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems, and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe do not have a recent operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been derived from former Parent\u2019s consolidated financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows would have been as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Former Parent did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a single stand-alone entity for the periods presented even if we represented an important business segment in former Parent\u2019s historical consolidated financial statements. In addition, the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows will be in the future. For example, following the spin-off, changes have occurred and will occur in our cost structure, funding and operations, including changes in our tax structure, increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale, and increased costs associated with becoming a public, stand-alone company. While we were profitable as part of former Parent, we cannot assure you that as a stand-alone company our profits will continue at a similar level.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spin-off.\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, we believe that our business will benefit from, among other things, the alignment of our cost structure with our business objectives and improved management incentive tools. However, now that we are separate from former Parent, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of former Parent. In addition, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, including additional revenues as a result of removing certain organizational conflicts of interest as a result of the spin-off, in the time we expect, if at all.\nOur customers, prospective customers and suppliers might not be satisfied that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them.\nSome of our customers, prospective customers, and suppliers may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them. If our customers, prospective customers, or suppliers are not satisfied with our financial stability, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to bid for and obtain or retain projects, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may incur greater costs as an independent company than we did when we were a part of former Parent.\nAs part of former Parent, we took advantage of former Parent\u2019s size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services such as insurance and health care benefits, and technology such as computer software licenses. We also relied on former Parent to provide various corporate functions. After the spin-off, as a separate, independent entity, we may be unable to obtain these goods, services, and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior to the distribution. We may also incur costs for functions previously performed by former Parent that are higher than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements, which could cause our profitability to decrease.\nWe currently share directors with former Parent, which means the overlap may give rise to conflicts.\nCertain members of our Board of Directors serve as directors of former Parent, but the overlapping directors do not constitute a majority of our Board members. These directors may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us or former Parent. For example, there could be the potential for a conflict of interest when we or former Parent look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both companies. Also, conflicts may arise if there are issues or disputes under the commercial arrangements that will exist between former Parent and us. Our Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of former Parent will review and address any potential conflict of interests that may arise between former Parent and us. Although no specific measures to resolve such conflicts of interest have been formulated, our Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of former Parent have a fiduciary obligation to deal fairly and in good faith. Our Board of Directors exercises reasonable judgment and takes such steps as they deem necessary under all of the\ncircumstances in resolving any specific conflict of interest which may occur and will determine what, if any, specific measures, such as retention of an independent advisor, independent counsel, or special committee, may be necessary or appropriate. Any such conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have limited operating history as an independent company upon which you can evaluate our performance and, accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any newly independent company encounters.\nWe previously operated as a business segment of former Parent. We have limited experience operating as an independent company and performing various corporate functions, including human resources, tax administration, legal (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and with the periodic reporting obligations of the Exchange Act), treasury administration, investor relations, internal audit, insurance, information technology, and telecommunications services, as well as the accounting for many items such as lease accounting and stock-based compensation, income taxes, and intangible assets. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in the early stages of independent business operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nwins and losses on contract competitions and new business pursuits;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nthe changes in customer requirements for our products and services;\n\u2022\nnatural or environmental disasters that investors believe may affect us;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations, coupled with changes in results of operations and general economic, political, and market conditions, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents, the Tax Matters Agreement, and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nWe have adopted the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws. Certain provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a Share Owner may consider favorable. For example, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prevents Share Owners from acting by written consent, and requires a supermajority Share Owner approval for certain business combinations with related persons. These provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on potential acquirers.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement entered into in connection with the spin-off, we have agreed not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition (including issuance) of our common stock or any other transaction (or, to the extent we have the right to prohibit it, to permit any such transaction) that could cause the distribution to be taxable to former Parent. We also agreed to indemnify former Parent for any tax resulting from any such transactions. Generally, former Parent will recognize taxable gain on the distribution if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of our capital stock, directly or indirectly, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of our then-outstanding capital stock, and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any such shares of our common stock acquired, directly or indirectly, within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% Share Owners and certain compensatory stock issuances) will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan\nunless that presumption is rebutted. As a result, our obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize our business and might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company.", "PERMNO": 14942, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "KE"}
