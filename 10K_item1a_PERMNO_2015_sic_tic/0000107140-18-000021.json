{"cik": "107140", "company": "WILEY JOHN & SONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-06-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of our securities. The risks below are the most significant risks we face, but are not the only risk factors we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem insignificant could impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Our business, consolidated financial position, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment.\nIf we are unable to introduce new technologies, products, and services, our ability to be profitable may be adversely affected.\nWe must continue to invest in technology and other innovations to adapt and add value to our products and services to remain competitive. This is particularly true in the current environment, where investment in new technology is ongoing and there are rapid changes in the products competitors are offering, the products our customers are seeking, and our sales and distribution channels. In some cases, investments will take the form of internal development; in others, they may take the form of an acquisition. There are uncertainties whenever developing or acquiring new products and services, and it is often possible that such new products and services may not be launched, or, if launched, may not be profitable or as profitable as existing products and services.\nThe demand for digital and lower cost books could impact our sales volumes and pricing in an adverse way.\nA common trend facing each of our businesses is the digitization of content and proliferation of distribution channels through the internet and other electronic means, which are replacing traditional print formats. The trend to digital content has also created contraction in the print book retail market which increases the risk of bankruptcy for certain retail customers, potentially leading to the disruption of short-term product supply to consumers, as well as potential bad debt write-offs. New distribution channels, such as digital formats, the internet, online retailers, and growing delivery platforms (e.g. tablets and e-readers), combined with the concentration of retailer power, present both risks and opportunities to our traditional publishing models, potentially impacting both sales volumes and pricing.\nAs the market has shifted to digital products, customer expectations for lower-priced products have increased due to customer awareness of reductions in production costs and the availability of free or low-cost digital content and products. As a result, there has been pressure to sell digital versions of products at prices below their print versions. Increased customer demand for lower prices could reduce our revenue.\nWe publish educational content for undergraduate, graduate, and advanced placement students, lifelong learners, and in Australia, for secondary school students. Due to growing student demand for less expensive textbooks, many college bookstores, online retailers and other entities offer used or rental textbooks to students at lower prices than new textbooks. The internet has made the used and rental textbook markets more efficient and has significantly increased student access to used and rental books. Further expansion of the used and rental book markets could further adversely affect our sales of print textbooks, subsequently affecting our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nA reduction in enrollment at colleges and universities could adversely affect the demand for our higher education products.\nEnrollment in U.S. colleges and universities can be adversely affected by many factors, including changes in government and private student loan and grant programs, uncertainty about current and future economic conditions, increases in tuition, general decreases in family income and net worth, and a perception of uncertain job prospects for recent graduates. In addition, enrollment levels at colleges and universities outside the United States are influenced by global and local economic factors, local political conditions, and other factors that make predicting foreign enrollment levels difficult. Reductions in expected levels of enrollment at colleges and universities both within and outside the United States could adversely affect demand for our higher education products, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nThe competitive pressures we face in our business, as well as our ability to retain our business relationships with our authors and professional societies, could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets. Success and continued growth depend greatly on developing new products and the means to deliver them in an environment of rapid technological change. Attracting new authors and professional societies while retaining our existing business relationships is critical to our success. If we are unable to retain our existing business relationships with authors and professional societies, this could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be protected, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our publications are protected by copyright, held either in our name, in the name of the author of the work, or in the name of a sponsoring professional society. Such copyrights protect our exclusive right to publish the work in many countries abroad for specified periods, in most cases, the author's life plus 70 years, but in any event, a minimum of 50 years for works published after 1978. Our ability to continue to achieve our expected results depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. Our consolidated financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected by lack of legal and/or technological protections for its intellectual property in some jurisdictions and markets.\nAdverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nOur professional customers worldwide rely upon many of our publications to perform their jobs. It is imperative that we consistently demonstrate our ability to maintain the integrity of the information included in our publications. Adverse publicity, whether valid or not, may reduce demand for our publications and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn our journal publishing business we have a trade concentration and credit risk related to subscription agents, and in our book business the industry has a concentration of customers in national, regional, and online bookstore chains. Changes in the financial position and liquidity of our subscription agents and customers, could adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn the journal publishing business, subscriptions are primarily sourced through journal subscription agents who, acting as agents for library customers, facilitate ordering by consolidating the subscription orders/billings of each subscriber with various publishers. Cash is generally collected in advance from subscribers by the subscription agents and is principally remitted to us between the months of December and April. Although at fiscal year-end we had minimal credit risk exposure to these agents, future calendar-year subscription receipts from these agents are highly dependent on their financial position and liquidity. Subscription agents account for approximately 20% of total annual consolidated revenue and no one agent accounts for more than 10% of total annual consolidated revenue.\nOur book business is not dependent upon a single customer; however, the industry is concentrated in national, regional, and online bookstore chains. Although no one book customer accounts for more than 8% of total consolidated revenue and 8% of accounts receivable at April 30, 2018, the top 10 book customers account for approximately 13% of total consolidated revenue and approximately 15% of accounts receivable at April 30, 2018. We maintain approximately $25 million of trade credit insurance, subject to certain limitations, covering balances due from certain named customers, which expires in June 2019.\nChanges in laws and regulations, including regulations related to open access, could adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe maintain operations in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The conduct of our business, including the sourcing of content, distribution, sales, marketing, and advertising, is subject to various laws and regulations administered by governments around the world. Changes in laws, regulations, or government policies, including tax regulations and accounting standards, may adversely affect our future consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nThe scientific research publishing industry generates much of its revenue from paid customer subscriptions to online and print journal content. There is debate within government, academic, and library communities whether such journal content should be made available for free, immediately or following a period of embargo after publication, referred to as \"open access,\" For instance, certain governments and privately held funding bodies have implemented mandates that require journal articles derived from government-funded research to be made available to the public at no cost after an embargo period. Open access can be achieved in two ways: Green, which enables authors to publish articles in subscription based journals and self-archive the author accepted version of the article for free public use after an embargo period, and Gold, which enables authors to publish their articles in journals that provide immediate free access to the final version of the article on the publisher's Web site, and elsewhere under permissive licensing terms, following payment of an Article Publication Charge (\"APC\"). These mandates have the potential to put pressure on subscription-based publications. If such regulations are widely implemented, our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo date, the majority of governments that have taken a position on open access have favored the green model and have generally specified embargo periods of twelve months. The publishing community generally takes the view that this period should be sufficient to protect subscription revenues, provided that publishers' platforms offer sufficient added value to the article. Governments in Europe have been more supportive of the gold model, which thus far is generating incremental revenue for publishers with active open access programs. A number of European administrations are showing interest in a business model which combines the purchasing of subscription content with the purchase of open access publishing for authors in their country. This development removes an element of risk by fixing revenues from that market, provided that the terms, price, and rate of transition negotiated are acceptable.\nA disruption or loss of data sources could limit our collection and use of certain kinds of information, which could adversely impact our communication with our customers.\nA number of our businesses rely extensively upon content and data from external sources. Data is obtained from public records, governmental authorities, customers and other information companies, including competitors. Legal regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), relating to internet communications, privacy and data protection, e-commerce, information governance, and use of public records, are becoming more prevalent worldwide. The disruption or loss of data sources, either because of changes in the law or because data suppliers decide not to supply them, may impose limits on our collection and use of certain kinds of information about individuals and our ability to communicate such information effectively with our customers. In addition, GDPR imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater.\nWe may not realize the anticipated cost savings and benefits from, or our business may be disrupted by, our business transformation and restructuring efforts.\nWe continue to transform our business from a traditional publishing model to being a global provider of content-enabled solutions with a focus on digital products and services. The acquisitions of Deltak.edu, LLC (\"Deltak\"), Inscape Holdings, Inc. (\"Inscape\"), Profiles International (\"Profiles\"), and CrossKnowledge Group Limited (\"CrossKnowledge\") comprise our Solutions reporting segment and, along with Atypon Systems, Inc. (\"Atypon\") in our Research segment, which was acquired in September 2016, represent examples of strategic initiatives that were implemented as part of our business transformation. We will continue to explore opportunities to develop new business models and enhance the efficiency of its organizational structure. The rapid pace and scope of change increases the risk that not all of our strategic initiatives will deliver the expected benefits within the anticipated timeframes. In addition, these efforts may somewhat disrupt our business activities, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe continue to restructure and realign our cost base with current and anticipated future market conditions. Significant risks associated with these actions that may impair our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings or that may disrupt our business include delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the U.S., decreases in employee morale, the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of key employees, and disruptions of third parties to whom we have outsourced business functions. In addition, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and consolidated financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not realize the anticipated cost savings and processing efficiencies associated with the outsourcing of certain business processes.\nWe have outsourced certain business functions, principally in technology, content management, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, fulfillment, distribution, returns processing, and certain other transactional processing functions, to third-party service providers to achieve cost savings, and efficiencies. If these third-party service providers do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated cost savings, and depending on the function involved, we may experience business disruption or processing inefficiencies, all with potential adverse effects on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe may be susceptible to information technology risks that may adversely impact our business, consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nInformation technology is a key part of our business strategy and operations. As a business strategy, Wiley's technology enables us to provide customers with new and enhanced products and services and is critical to our success in migrating from print to digital business models. Information technology is also a fundamental component of all of our business processes, collecting and reporting business data, and communicating internally and externally with customers, suppliers, employees, and others.\nOur business is dependent on information technology systems to support our businesses. We provide internet-based products and services to our customers. We also use complex information technology systems and products to support our business activities, particularly in infrastructure, and as we move our products and services to an increasingly digital delivery platform.\nWe face technological risks associated with internet-based product and service delivery in our businesses, including with respect to information technology capability, reliability and security, enterprise resource planning, system implementations and upgrades. Failures of our information technology systems and products (including because of operational failure, natural disaster, computer virus, or hacker attacks) could interrupt the availability of our internet-based products and services, result in corruption or loss of data or breach in security, and result in liability or reputational damage to our brands and/or adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nManagement has designed and implemented policies, processes and controls to mitigate risks of information technology failure and to provide security from unauthorized access to our systems. In addition, we have disaster recovery plans in place to maintain business continuity. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks common to most industries from inadvertent or intentional actions by employees, vendors, or malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives. While we have taken steps to address these risks, there can be no assurance that a system failure, disruption, or data security breach would not adversely affect our business and could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. We are in the process of implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our operational and financial systems and processes. As of April 30, 2018, we have completed the implementation of record-to-report, purchase-to-pay, and several other business processes within all locations and will continue to roll out additional processes and functionality of the ERP in phases over the next year. Implementation of a new ERP system involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design or implementation of a new system could result in increased costs, disruptions in operations, or delays in the collection of cash from our customers, as well as having an adverse effect on our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks and hackers are becoming more sophisticated and pervasive. Our business is dependent on information technology systems to support our businesses. We provide internet-based products and services to our customers. We also use complex information technology systems and products to support our business activities, particularly in infrastructure and as we move our products and services to an increasingly digital delivery platform. Across our businesses, we hold personal data, including that of employees and customers.\nEfforts to prevent cyber-attacks and hackers from entering our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our systems. Individuals may try to gain unauthorized access to our systems and data for malicious purposes, and our security measures may fail to prevent such unauthorized access. Cyber-attacks and/or intentional hacking of our systems could adversely affect the performance or availability of our products, result in loss of customer data, adversely affect our ability to conduct business, or result in theft of our funds or proprietary information, the occurrence of which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-U.S. revenues, as well as our substantial non-U.S. net assets, expose our consolidated results to volatility from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues accounted for 47% of our total consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2018, which primarily includes revenues in British pound sterling of 27% and euro of 12%. In addition, our interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates. These risks and the measures we have taken to help mitigate them are discussed in Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may, from time-to-time, use derivative instruments to hedge such risks. Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in external market or fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, inflation, or other related factors affecting our business, consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to mitigate the impact of inflation and cost increases, which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we experience cost increases reflecting, in part, general inflationary factors. There is no guarantee that we can increase selling prices or reduce costs to fully mitigate the effect of inflation on our costs, which may adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws, including the U.S. recently enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to tax laws within the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. In addition to the recently enacted Tax Act in the U.S., changes in tax laws in other jurisdictions where we do business, such as the U.K. and Germany, could significantly impact the taxation of our non-U.S. earnings. This could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations as most of our income is earned outside the U.S. In addition, we are subject to audit by tax authorities and are regularly audited by various tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nThe final impacts of the Tax Act could be materially different from our current estimates.\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The provisions are broad and complex and depend upon future guidance as well any legislative action to address questions. Our estimated amounts are based on information available at this time and our current understanding of the Tax Act. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from our estimate, possibly materially.\nChallenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets has a higher risk due to political instability, economic volatility, crime, terrorism, corruption, social and ethnic unrest, and other factors, which may adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe sell our products to customers in certain sanctioned and previously sanctioned developing markets where we do not have operating subsidiaries. We do not own any assets or liabilities in these markets except for trade receivables. In fiscal year 2018, we recorded revenue and net earnings of $4.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, related to sales to Cuba, Sudan, Syria and Iran. While sales in these markets are not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations, adverse developments related to the risks associated with these markets may cause actual results to differ from historical and forecasted future consolidated operating results.\nWe have certain technology development operations in Russia related to software development and architecture, digital content production, and system testing services. Due to the political instability within the region, there is the potential for future government embargos and sanctions which could disrupt our operations in this area. While we have developed business continuity plans to address these issues, further adverse developments in the region could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nApproximately 16% of Research journal articles are sourced from authors in China. Any restrictions on exporting intellectual property could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in global economic conditions could impact our ability to borrow funds and meet our future financing needs.\nChanges in global financial markets have not had, nor do we anticipate they will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our significant operating cash flow, financial assets, access to capital markets, and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. As market conditions change, we will continue to monitor our liquidity position. However, there can be no assurance that our liquidity or our consolidated financial position and results of operations will not be adversely affected by possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions. Unprecedented market conditions including illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency rates, and economic recession could affect future results.\nChanges in pension costs and related funding requirements may impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees worldwide. Our Board of Directors approved amendments to the U.S., Canada and U.K. defined benefit plans that froze the future accumulation of benefits effective June 30, 2013, December 31, 2015, and April 30, 2015, respectively. The funding requirements and costs of these plans are dependent upon various factors, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics, and changes in pension regulations. Changes in these factors affect our plan funding, consolidated financial position, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our growth strategies, including successfully integrating acquisitions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nOur growth strategy includes title, imprint, and other business acquisitions, including knowledge-enabled services, which complement our existing businesses. Acquisitions may have a substantial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in integrating acquired operations and in realizing expected opportunities, cost synergies, diversions of management resources, and loss of key employees, challenges with respect to operating new businesses, and other uncertainties.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of the related assets.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademarks and developed technologies. At April 30, 2018, we had $1,019.8 million of goodwill and $848.1 million of intangible assets, of which $232.8 million are indefinite-lived intangible assets, on our consolidated balance sheet. The intangible assets are principally composed of content and publishing rights, customer relationships, and brands and trademarks. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections could result in an asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to our consolidated results of operations. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with determinable lives, which were $615.3 million at April 30, 2018, are tested for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment exists can be difficult as a result of increased uncertainty and current market dynamics, and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments. A non-cash intangible asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel, our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have a significant investment in our employees around the world. We offer competitive salaries and benefits in order to attract and retain the highly skilled workforce needed to sustain and develop new products and services required for growth. Employment and benefit costs are affected by competitive market conditions for qualified individuals, and factors such as healthcare and retirement benefit costs.\nWe are highly dependent on the continued services of key employees who have in-depth market and business knowledge and/or key relationships with business partners. The loss of the services of key personnel for any reason and our inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, and results of operation.", "PERMNO": 82932, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "JW.A"}
