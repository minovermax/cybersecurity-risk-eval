{"cik": "1518715", "company": "HomeStreet, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this report.\nWe are growing rapidly, and we may be unable to manage our growth properly.\nIn 2012, HomeStreet completed its initial public offering of common stock. At that time HomeStreet had been operating under regulatory orders that had been imposed during the financial crisis of 2007 through 2010 as a result of HomeStreet Bank having experienced operating losses, capital impairment, asset quality deterioration and a number of related operational and management issues. In early 2010 we began recruiting a new management team, and the recapitalization brought about by our initial public offering, together with aggressive management strategies, helped us substantially improve all aspects of our operations and financial condition. As a result of a combination of these factors, our regulators removed all extraordinary restrictions on our operations by early 2013. In November 2013 we completed the simultaneous acquisitions by merger of Fortune Bank, headquartered in Seattle, and Yakima National Bank, headquartered in Yakima, Washington. In December 2013 we completed the acquisition of two Seattle branches from AmericanWest Bank. In March 2015, we completed the acquisition by merger of Simplicity Bancorp and the merger of Simplicity Bank with and into HomeStreet Bank (\"Simplicity Merger\"). That merger represents our third whole-bank acquisition in less than two years. Simultaneously, we have grown our mortgage origination operations opportunistically but quickly, opening new offices in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas of California in 2013 and 2014, and further expanding our mortgage origination operations into Arizona beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 while also continuing to grow those operations in the Pacific Northwest. We also expanded our residential construction lending activities, opening a new office in Salt Lake City, Utah and adding production personnel in Southern California during 2014.\nAt the time we completed our IPO, and after giving effect to the $77.6 million in net proceeds from that offering, based on December 31, 2011 balances, we had total assets of approximately $2.4 billion, total deposits of approximately $2.0 billion, and total loans of approximately $1.5 billion, and we had approximately 600 employees. At December 31, 2014, we had total assets of approximately $3.5 billion, total deposits of $2.4 billion, total loans of approximately $2.7 billion, and approximately 1,600 employees. As of December 31, 2014, Simplicity had total assets of approximately $863 million, total deposits of $656 million, and total loans of approximately $683 million. Further, unlike the Fortune Bank and Yakima National Bank acquisitions, which together resulted in only modest geographic expansion, the Simplicity Merger represents a substantial geographic expansion of our commercial and consumer banking operations. We have plans to continue growing strategically, and we may also grow opportunistically from time to time. Growth can present substantial demands on management personnel, line employees, and other aspects of a bank\u2019s operations, and those challenges are particularly pronounced when growth occurs rapidly. We may face difficulties in managing that growth, and we may experience a variety of adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nLoss of or damage to key customer relationships;\n\u2022\nDistraction of management from ordinary course operations;\n\u2022\nLoss of key employees or significant numbers of employees;\n\u2022\nThe potential of litigation from prior employers relating to the portability of their employees;\n\u2022\nCosts associated with opening new offices to accommodate our growth in employees;\n\u2022\nIncreased costs related to hiring, training and providing initial compensation to new employees, which may not be recouped if those employees do not remain with us long enough to be profitable;\n\u2022\nChallenges in complying with legal and regulatory requirements in new jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nInadequacies in our computer systems, accounting policies and procedures, and management personnel (some of which may be difficult to detect until other problems become manifest);\n\u2022\nChallenges integrating different systems, practices, and customer relationships;\n\u2022\nAn inability to attract and retain personnel whose experience and (in certain circumstances) business relationships promote the achievement of our strategic goals; and\n\u2022\nIncreasing volatility in our operating results as we progress through these initiatives.\nThe integration of Simplicity into HomeStreet following the Simplicity Merger, as well as any future acquisitions, could consume significant resources, present significant challenges in integration and may not be successful.\nIn March 2015, we completed the Simplicity Merger and are working to integrate the Simplicity operations into HomeStreet\u2019s operations. There are certain risks related to that integration, and similar risks may arise if we seek out other acquisitions in the near future as we look for ways to continue to grow our business and our market share. Any future acquisition we may undertake may involve numerous risks related to the investigation and consideration of the potential acquisition and the costs of undertaking such a transaction, and both the Simplicity integration and integration into HomeStreet or HomeStreet Bank of any other assets or entities we may acquire in the future involve inherent risks, including risks that arise after the transaction is completed. These risks include:\n\u2022\nDiversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u2022\nCosts incurred in the process of vetting potential acquisition candidates which we may not recoup;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in implementing, upgrading and maintaining our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nInability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nEntry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nPotential responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nInability to maintain our internal standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired companies or businesses; and\n\u2022\nPotential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.\nDifficulties in pursuing or integrating any new acquisitions may increase our costs and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, even if we successfully address these factors and are successful in closing the transaction and integrating the systems together, we may nonetheless experience customer losses, or we may fail to grow the acquired businesses as we intend.\nFluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our assets and reduce our net interest income and noninterest income, thereby adversely affecting our earnings and profitability.\nInterest rates may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including general and economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. For example, increases in interest rates in early 2014 reduced our mortgage revenues in large part by drastically reducing the market for refinancings, which negatively impacted our noninterest income and, to a lesser extent, our net interest income, as well as demand for our residential loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans in the first half of 2014. Our earnings are also dependent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings and may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, changes to market interest rates may impact the level of loans, deposits and investments and the credit quality of existing loans.\nIn addition, our securities portfolio includes securities that are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises and other securities that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The unrealized gains or losses in our available-for-sale portfolio are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized upon sale. Future interest rate fluctuations may impact the value of these securities and as a result, shareholders' equity, causing material fluctuations from quarter to quarter. Failure to hold our securities until maturity or until market conditions are favorable for a sale could adversely affect our financial condition.\nA significant portion of our noninterest income is derived from originating residential mortgage loans and selling them into the secondary market. That business has benefited from a long period of historically low interest rates. To the extent interest rates rise again, particularly if they rise substantially, we may experience another reduction in mortgage financing of new home purchases and refinancing. These factors have negatively affected our mortgage loan origination volume and our noninterest income in the past and may do so again in the future.\nWe have recently identified certain deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, and those deficiencies or others that we have not discovered may result in our inability to maintain control over our assets or to identify and accurately report our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting include those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nEach year, our management, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer, conducts an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2014, because of a material weakness in our internal controls related to certain new back office systems, primarily relating to accounts payable processing and payroll processing. Implementation of key systems requires that management perform a thorough risk assessment to adequately assess risk at an appropriate level of detail to allow for (i) the design of controls with the appropriate precision and responsiveness to address those risks, (ii) the timely and effective implementation of controls, including evidence of operating effectiveness, and (iii) effective monitoring of the controls. Management concluded that its risk assessment related to these changes was not comprehensive enough and that sufficient documentation was not maintained. In each of these cases, management determined that no material loss occurred, and that we did not have an actual misstatement of our financial statements. However, management also noted that in the absence of specific management attention, we could have experienced a material loss or could have made a material error in the reporting of our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2014. Management thus determined that these potential outcomes reflect a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, and that, as a result, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014.\nThese deficiencies are discussed in greater detail under Item 9A, \u201cInternal Control over Financial Reporting,\u201d and led management to conclude that as of December 31, 2014, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. Management has identified certain remedial measures that we believe will resolve these deficiencies. However, if these measures are not effective, or if our internal controls over financial reporting are subject to additional defects we have not identified, we may be unable to maintain adequate control over our assets, or we may experience material errors in recording our assets, liabilities and results of operations. Further, we reported an unrelated material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting following the end of our third fiscal quarter of 2014. Repeated or continuing deficiencies may cause investors to question the reliability of our internal controls or our financial statements, and may result in an erosion of confidence in our management.\nCurrent economic conditions continue to pose significant challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest and noninterest income that we earn from our mortgage banking and commercial lending businesses. Our operations have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. Although the U.S. economy has continued to gradually improve from the recessionary levels of 2008 and early 2009, economic growth has been slow and uneven.\nA prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. economy, or any deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the financial markets resulting from these factors, or any other events or factors that may disrupt or dampen the economic recovery, could materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. If economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand for our credit products, including our mortgages, may fall, reducing our net interest and noninterest income and our earnings.\nIn addition, financial institutions continue to be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets, along with an arduous and changing regulatory climate in which regulations passed in response to conditions and events during the economic downturn continue to be implemented. Recent improvements in the housing market may not continue, and a return to a recessionary economy could result in financial stress on our borrowers that may result in volatility in home prices, increased\nforeclosures and significant write-downs of asset values, all of which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, we may face risks related to market conditions that may negatively impact our business opportunities and plans, such as:\n\u2022\nMarket developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities;\n\u2022\nRegulatory scrutiny of the industry could further increase, leading to stricter regulation of our industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to the judicial system and the plaintiff\u2019s bar;\n\u2022\nThe models we use to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may prove less reliable than we had anticipated in predicting future behaviors which may impair our ability to make good underwriting decisions;\n\u2022\nIf our forecasts of economic conditions and other economic predictions are not accurate, we may face challenges in accurately estimating the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans;\n\u2022\nFurther erosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury may lead to new taxes limiting the ability of the Company to pursue growth and return profits to shareholders; and\n\u2022\nFuture political developments and fiscal policy decisions may create uncertainty in the marketplace.\nIf recovery from the economic recession slows or if we experience another recessionary dip, our ability to access capital and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nAny restructuring or replacement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and changes in existing government-sponsored and federal mortgage programs could adversely affect our business.\nWe originate and purchase, sell and thereafter service single family and multifamily mortgages under the Fannie Mae, and to a lesser extent the Freddie Mac single family purchase programs and the Fannie Mae multifamily DUS program. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship, and since then Congress, various executive branch agencies and certain large private investors in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have offered a wide range of proposals aimed at restructuring these agencies. While the Obama administration and certain members of Congress have called for scaling back the role of the U.S. government in, and promoting the return of private capital to, the mortgage markets and the reduction of the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the mortgage markets by, among other things, reducing conforming loan limits, increasing guarantee fees and requiring larger down payments by borrowers with the ultimate goal of winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, others have focused on ways to bring additional private capital into the system in order to reduce taxpayer risk. We expect that Congress will continue to hold hearings and consider legislation on the future status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including proposals that would result in Fannie Mae\u2019s liquidation or dissolution.\nHowever, we cannot be certain if or when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ultimately will be restructured or wound down, if or when additional reform of the housing finance market will be implemented or what the future role of the U.S. government will be in the mortgage market, and, accordingly, we will not be able to determine the impact that any such reform may have on us until a definitive reform plan is adopted. However, any restructuring or replacement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that restricts the current loan purchase programs of those entities may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, we have recorded on our balance sheet an intangible asset (mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs) relating to our right to service single and multifamily loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That MSR asset was valued at $123.3 million at December 31, 2014. Changes in the policies and operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or any replacement for or successor to those entities that adversely affect our single family residential loan and DUS mortgage servicing assets may require us to record impairment charges to the value of these assets, and significant impairment charges could be material and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, our ability to generate income through mortgage sales to institutional investors depends in part on programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, which facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of those programs could have a material adverse effect on our loan origination and mortgage sales as well as our results of operations. Also, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary market or the underwriting criteria of these entities could negatively impact our results of business, operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements under Basel III.\nAs of January 1, 2015, we are subject to new rules relating to capital standards requirements, including requirements contemplated by Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III. A substantial portion of these rules applies to both the Company and the Bank, including a requirement that both the Company and the Bank have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0% and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0%. In addition, beginning in 2016, both the Company and the Bank will be required to establish a \u201cconservation buffer\u201d, consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, equal to 2.5%, which means in effect that, once the conservation buffer is fully phased in, in order to prevent certain regulatory restrictions, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement will be 7.0%, the Tier 1 risk-based ratio requirement will be 8.5% and the total risk-based ratio requirement will be 10.5%. Any institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The requirement for a conservation buffer will be phased in beginning in 2016 and will take full effect on January 1, 2019.\nBeginning in 2015, additional prompt corrective action rules will apply to the Bank, including higher and new ratio requirements for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized. The new rules also modify the manner for determining when certain capital elements are included in the ratio calculations. Under current capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, banking organizations that are not required to use advanced approaches, including the Company and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and Bank expect to make this election in 2015 in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company's securities portfolio.\nIn addition, deductions include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets not dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from the new common equity Tier 1 capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of new common equity Tier 1 capital, or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of new common equity Tier 1 capital. Maintaining higher capital levels may result in lower profits for the Company as we will not be able to grow our lending as quickly as we might otherwise be able to do if we were to maintain lower capital levels. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision of Home Street Bank - Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements - New Capital Regulations\u201d in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe sale of approximately 24% of our MSR portfolio in the second quarter of 2014 was consummated in part to facilitate balance sheet and capital management in preparation for Basel III. The application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that may restrict our activities, including declaring cash dividends or capital distributions, and imposes financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the FDIC, the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve, and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject are evolving and change frequently. Changes to those laws, rules and regulations are also sometimes retroactively applied. Examination findings by the regulatory agencies may result in adverse consequences to the Company or the Bank. We have, in the past, been subject to specific regulatory orders that constrained our business and required us to take measures that investors may have deemed undesirable, and we may again in the future be subject to such orders if banking regulators were to determine that our operations require such restrictions. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the authority to restrict our operations, adversely reclassify our assets, determine the level of deposit premiums assessed and require us to increase our allowance for loan losses.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has increased our costs of operations and may have a material negative effect on us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the laws as they apply to financial institutions and revised and expanded the rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority of federal banking regulators. It is also having a material impact on our relationships with current and future customers.\nSome of these changes were effective immediately, although others are still being phased in gradually. In addition, the statute in many instances calls for regulatory rulemaking to implement its provisions. While many of the provisions are now being implemented, such as the Basel III capital standards, not all of the regulations called for by Dodd-Frank have been completed or are in effect, so the precise contours of the law and its effects on us cannot yet be fully understood. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the subsequent exercise by regulators of their revised and expanded powers thereunder could materially and negatively impact the profitability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a requirement that private securitizers of mortgage and other asset backed securities retain, subject to certain exemptions, not less than five percent of the credit risk of the mortgages or other assets backing the securities. The regulatory agencies published the final Risk Retention rules in December 2014; compliance is required beginning in December 2015 for residential mortgage-backed securitizations and December 2016 for all other securitization types. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNew federal and state legislation, case law or regulatory action may negatively impact our business.\nEnacted legislation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future federal and state legislation, case law and regulations could require us to revise our operations and change certain business practices, impose additional costs, reduce our revenue and earnings and otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance,\n\u2022\nRecent legislation and court decisions with precedential value could allow judges to modify the terms of residential mortgages in bankruptcy proceedings and could hinder our ability to foreclose promptly on defaulted mortgage loans or expand assignee liability for certain violations in the mortgage loan origination process, any or all of which could adversely affect our business or result in our being held responsible for violations in the mortgage loan origination process.\n\u2022\nCongress and various regulatory authorities have proposed programs that would require a reduction in principal balances of \u201cunderwater\u201d residential mortgages, which if implemented would tend to reduce loan servicing income and which might adversely affect the carrying values of portfolio loans.\nThese or other judicial decisions or legislative actions, if upheld or implemented, may limit our ability to take actions that may be essential to preserve the value of the mortgage loans we service or hold for investment. Any restriction on our ability to foreclose on a loan, any requirement that we forego a portion of the amount otherwise due on a loan or any requirement that we modify any original loan terms may require us to advance principal, interest, tax and insurance payments, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Given the relatively high percentage of our business that derives from originating residential mortgages, any such actions are likely to have a significant impact on our business, and the effects we experience will likely be disproportionately high in comparison to financial institutions whose residential mortgage lending is more attenuated.\nIn addition, while these legislative and regulatory proposals and courts decisions generally have focused primarily, if not exclusively, on residential mortgage origination and servicing, other laws and regulations may be enacted that affect the manner in which we do business and the products and services that we provide, restrict our ability to grow through acquisition, restrict our ability to compete in our current business or expand into any new business, and impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on us or increase our regulatory oversight.\nPolicies and regulations enacted by CFPB may negatively impact our residential mortgage loan business and compliance risk.\nOur consumer business, including our mortgage, credit card, and other consumer lending and non-lending businesses, may be adversely affected by the policies enacted or regulations adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) which under the Dodd-Frank Act has broad rulemaking authority over consumer financial products and services. For example, in January 2014 new federal regulations promulgated by the CFPB took effect which impact how we originate and service residential mortgage loans. Those regulations, among other things, require mortgage lenders to assess and document a borrower\u2019s ability to repay their mortgage loan. The regulations provide borrowers the ability to challenge foreclosures and sue for damages based on allegations that the lender failed to meet the standard for determining the borrower\u2019s ability to repay their loan. While the regulations include presumptions in favor of the lender based on certain loan underwriting criteria, it is uncertain how these presumptions will be construed and applied by courts in the event of litigation. The ultimate impact of these new regulations on the lender\u2019s enforcement of its loan documents in the event of a loan default, and the cost and expense\nof doing so, is uncertain, but may be significant. In addition, the secondary market demand for loans that do not fall within the presumptively safest category of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d as defined by the CFPB is uncertain. The 2014 regulations also require changes to certain loan servicing procedures and practices, which result in increased foreclosure costs and longer foreclosure timelines in the event of loan default, and failure to comply with the new servicing rules may result in additional litigation and compliance risk. On November 20, 2014, the CFPB released its Final Integrated Disclosure Rule (\u201cRule\u201d) that will become effective on August 1, 2015. Among other things, the new rule requires lenders to combine the initial Good Faith Estimate and Initial Truth in Lending (\u201cTIL\u201d) disclosures into a single new Loan Estimate disclosure and the HUD-1 and Final TIL disclosures into a single new Closing Disclosure. The definition of an application and timing requirements will also change, and a new Closing Disclosure waiting period has been added. These changes, along with other changes required by the Rule, will require significant systems modifications, process and procedures changes and training. Failure to comply with these new requirements may result in penalties for disclosure violations under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d) and the Truth In Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d).\nIn addition, the CFPB recently proposed additional rules under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\u201cHMDA\u201d) that are intended to improve information reported about the residential mortgage market and increase disclosure about consumer access to mortgage credit. As drafted, the proposed updates to the HMDA increase the types of dwelling-secured loans that would be subject to the disclosure requirements of the rule and expand the categories of information that financial institutions such as the Bank would be required to report with respect to such loans and such borrowers, including potentially sensitive customer information. If implemented, these changes would increase our compliance costs due to the need for additional resources to meet the enhanced disclosure requirements, including additional personnel and training costs as well as informational systems to allow the Bank to properly capture and report the additional mandated information. The anticipated volume of new data that would be required to be reported under the updated rules would also cause the Bank to face an increased risk of errors in the information. More importantly, because of the sensitive nature of some of the additional customer information to be included in such reports, the Bank would face a higher potential for a security breach resulting in the disclosure of sensitive customer information in the event the HMDA reporting files were obtained by an unauthorized party. The comment period for these proposed rules closed on October 29, 2014 and the final rules have not yet been released.\nWhile the full impact of CFPB's activities on our business is still unknown, we anticipate that the proposed rule change under the HMDA and other CFPB actions that may follow may increase our compliance costs and require changes in our business practices as a result of new regulations and requirements and could limit the products and services we are able to provide to customers. We are unable to predict whether U.S. federal, state or local authorities, or other pertinent bodies, will enact legislation, laws, rules, regulations, handbooks, guidelines or similar provisions that will affect our business or require changes in our practices in the future, and any such changes could adversely affect our cost of doing business and profitability.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and we use estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be imprecise and result in significant changes in valuation.\nA portion of our assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, including investment securities available for sale, mortgage servicing rights related to single family loans and single family loans held for sale. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or internal valuation models that utilize observable market data inputs to estimate their fair value. In certain cases, observable market prices and data may not be readily available or their availability may be diminished due to market conditions. We use financial models to value certain of these assets. These models are complex and use asset-specific collateral data and market inputs for interest rates. Although we have processes and procedures in place governing internal valuation models and their testing and calibration, such assumptions are complex as we must make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation, which in turn could affect earnings or result in significant changes in the dollar amount of assets reported on the balance sheet.\nIf we fail to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring of internal control from time to time we have discovered deficiencies in our internal control as defined under standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, that have required remediation. Under the PCAOB standards, a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material\nmisstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. A \u201csignificant deficiency\u201d is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affect a company\u2019s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a more than remote likelihood that a misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected.\nTo support our growth initiatives and to create operating efficiencies the company has implemented, and will continue to implement, new systems and processes. If our project management processes are not sound and adequate resources are not deployed to these implementations we may experience internal control lapses that could expose the company to operating losses.\nIf we discover additional deficiencies in our internal controls, we may also identify defects in our disclosure controls and procedures that require remediation. If we discover additional deficiencies, we will take affirmative steps to improve our internal and disclosure controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal and disclosure controls, including the deficiencies identified in this report, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nHomeStreet, Inc. primarily relies on dividends from the Bank and payment of dividends by the Bank may be limited by applicable laws and regulations.\nHomeStreet, Inc. is a separate legal entity from the Bank, and although we may receive some dividends from HomeStreet Capital Corporation, the primary source of our funds from which we service our debt, pay any dividends that we may declare to our shareholders and otherwise satisfy our obligations is dividends from the Bank. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations, as well as by our policy of retaining a significant portion of our earnings to support the Bank's operations. New capital rules impose more stringent capital requirements to maintain \u201cwell capitalized\u201d status which may additionally impact the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Management - New Capital Regulations\u201d as well as \u201cRegulation of Home Street Bank - Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements - New Capital Rules\u201d in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. If the Bank cannot pay dividends to us, we may be limited in our ability to service our debts, fund the Company's operations and acquisition plans and pay dividends to the Company's shareholders. While the Company has made special dividend distributions to its public shareholders in prior quarters, the Company has not adopted a dividend policy and the board of directors determined that it is in the best interests of the shareholders not to declare a dividend to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2014. As such, our dividends are not regular and are subject to restriction due to cash flow limitations, capital requirements, capital needs of the business or other factors.\nWe cannot assure you that we will remain profitable.\nWe have sustained significant losses in the past and our profitability has declined in recent quarters. We cannot guarantee that we will remain profitable or be able to maintain the level of profit we are currently experiencing. Many factors determine whether or not we will be profitable, and our ability to remain profitable is threatened by a myriad of issues, including:\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates may limit our ability to make loans, decrease our net interest income and noninterest income, reduce demand for loans, increase the cost of deposits and otherwise negatively impact our financial situation;\n\u2022\nVolatility in mortgage markets, which is driven by factors outside of our control such as interest rate changes, housing inventory and general economic conditions, may negatively impact our ability to originate loans and change the fair value of our existing loans and servicing rights;\n\u2022\nChanges in regulations may negatively impact the Company or the Bank and may limit our ability to offer certain products or services or may increase our costs of compliance;\n\u2022\nIncreased costs from growth through acquisition could exceed the income growth anticipated from these opportunities, especially in the short term as these acquisitions are integrated into our business;\n\u2022\nChanges in government-sponsored enterprises and their ability to insure or to buy our loans in the secondary market may result in significant changes in our ability to recognize income on sale of our loans to third parties;\n\u2022\nCompetition in the mortgage market industry may drive down the interest rates we are able to offer on our mortgages, which will negatively impact our net interest income;\n\u2022\nChanges in the cost structures and fees of government-sponsored enterprises to whom we sell many of these loans may compress our margins and reduce our net income and profitability; and\n\u2022\nOur hedging strategies to offset risks related to interest rate changes may not prove to be successful and may result in unanticipated losses for the Company.\nThese and other factors may limit our ability to generate revenue in excess of our costs, which in turn may result in a lower rate of profitability or even substantial losses for the Company.\nFederal, state and local consumer protection laws may restrict our ability to offer and/ or increase our risk of liability with respect to certain products and services and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain practices considered \u201cpredatory\u201d or \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d. These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, failing to disclose key features, limitations, or costs related to products and services, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans, imposing excessive fees for overdrafts, and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans or engage in deceptive practices, but these laws and regulations create the potential for liability with respect to our lending, servicing, loan investment and deposit taking activities. As we offer products and services to customers in additional states, we may become subject to additional state and local laws designed to protect consumers. The additional laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business, and ultimately may prevent us from making certain loans, offering certain products, and may cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans and other products and services that we do provide.\nThe significant concentration of real estate secured loans in our portfolio has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our asset quality and profitability.\nSubstantially all of our loans are secured by real property. Our real estate secured lending is generally sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in real estate sales and prices, significant increases in interest rates, and a degeneration in prevailing economic conditions may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, foreclosures, problem loans, OREO, net charge-offs and provisions for credit and OREO losses. Although real estate prices are stable in the markets in which we operate, if market values decline, the collateral for our loans may provide less security and our ability to recover the principal, interest and costs due on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, leaving us more likely to suffer additional losses on defaulted loans. Such declines may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose loan portfolios are more geographically diversified.\nWorsening conditions in the real estate market and higher than normal delinquency and default rates on loans could cause other adverse consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nThe reduction of cash flows and capital resources, as we are required to make cash advances to meet contractual obligations to investors, process foreclosures, and maintain, repair and market foreclosed properties;\n\u2022\nDeclining mortgage servicing fee revenues because we recognize these revenues only upon collection;\n\u2022\nIncreasing loan servicing costs;\n\u2022\nDeclining fair value on our mortgage servicing rights; and\n\u2022\nDeclining fair values and liquidity of securities held in our investment portfolio that are collateralized by mortgage obligations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures. Future additions to our allowance for loan losses will reduce our earnings.\nOur business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. As with most financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for defaults and nonperformance, which represents management's best estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management's estimate is the result of our continuing evaluation of specific credit risks and loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, industry concentrations and other factors that may indicate future loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Generally, our nonperforming loans and\nOREO reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers and weaknesses in the economies of the markets we serve. This allowance may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and future provisions for losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, as a result of our acquisitions of Simplicity Bank on March 1, 2015 and Fortune Bank, Yakima National Bank and two branches of AmericanWest Bank in the second half of 2013, we have added the loans previously held by the acquired companies or related to the acquired branches to our books. Any future acquisitions we may make will have a similar result. Although we review loan quality as part of our due diligence in considering any acquisition, the addition of such loans may increase our credit risk exposure, requiring an increase in our allowance for loan losses or we may experience adverse effects to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows stemming from losses on those additional loans.\nOur real estate lending also exposes us to environmental liabilities.\nIn the course of our business, it is necessary to foreclose and take title to real estate, which could subject us to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. Hazardous substances or waste, contaminants, pollutants or sources thereof may be discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. We could be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial and could substantially exceed the value of the real property. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. We may be unable to recover costs from any third party. These occurrences may materially reduce the value of the affected property, and we may find it difficult or impossible to use or sell the property prior to or following any environmental remediation. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA failure in or breach of our security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, resulting from cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Those parties also may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks, either managed directly by us or through our data processing vendors. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, we are heavily reliant on our third party vendors, and our vendors\u2019 or our own technologies, systems, networks and our customers' devices may become the target of cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, unauthorized access, hackers or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Company or our customers' confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt the Company's or its customers' or other third parties' business operations.\nThird parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. In addition, some of our primary third party service providers may be subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny due to regulatory findings during examinations of such service provider(s) conducted by federal regulators. While we have and will subject such vendor(s) to higher scrutiny and monitor any corrective measures that the vendor(s) are taking or would undertake, we are not able to fully mitigate any risk which could result from a breach or other operational failure caused by this, or any other vendor\u2019s breach.\nTo date we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to implement our Internet banking and mobile banking channel, our expanding operations and the outsourcing of a significant portion of our business operations. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices\ndesigned to protect customer information, our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to insure, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate important information security vulnerabilities, however, our measures may be insufficient to prevent physical .and electronic break-ins, denial of service and other cyber-attacks or security breaches.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, financial losses, the inability of our customers to transact business with us, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, additional regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage, litigation, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe network and computer systems on which we depend could fail or experience security breaches.\nOur computer systems could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Because we conduct a part of our business over the Internet and outsource several critical functions to third parties, operations will depend on our ability, as well as the ability of third-party service providers, to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical break-ins or similar catastrophic events. Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in operations may compromise our ability to perform critical functions in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as our reputation and customer or vendor relationships.\nIn addition, a significant barrier to online financial transactions is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our Internet banking system relies on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms our third-party service providers use to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise of security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to protect our customers\u2019 confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to state and federal privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations that, among other things restrict the use and dissemination of, and access to, the information that we produce, store or maintain in the course of our business. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and customers. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information, and in some instances may impose indemnity obligations on us relating to unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of any such information.\nThe actions we may take in order to promote compliance with these obligations vary by business segment and may change over time, but may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nTraining and educating our employees and independent contractors regarding our obligations relating to confidential information;\n\u2022\nMonitoring changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements;\n\u2022\nDrafting and enforcing appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues;\n\u2022\nMaintaining secure storage facilities and protocols for tangible records;\n\u2022\nPhysically and technologically securing access to electronic information; and\n\u2022\nIn the event of a security breach, providing credit monitoring or other services to affected customers.\nIf we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, penalties or fines, increased compliance costs, litigation and damage to our reputation, which in turn could result in decreased revenues and loss of customers, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service and technology providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend, to a significant extent, on a number of relationships with third-party service and technology providers. Specifically, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems and deposit and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers, or if any parties to whom our third party service providers have subcontracted services, experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted and our operating expenses may be materially increased. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if our third-party service and technology providers, including our mortgage loan origination technology provider, fail to update their systems or services in a timely manner to reflect new or changing regulation, our ability to meet regulatory requirements may be impacted and may expose us to heightened regulatory scrutiny and the potential for payment of monetary penalties.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many national vendors provide turn-key services to community banks, such as Internet banking and remote deposit capture that allow smaller banks to compete with institutions that have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able, however, to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment with respect to investment securities, including the FHLB stock we hold.\nOur securities portfolio currently includes securities with unrecognized losses. We may continue to observe declines in the fair market value of these securities. We evaluate the securities portfolio for any other than temporary impairment each reporting period. In addition, as a condition of membership in the FHLB, we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB. Our FHLB stock is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. Future negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings. The FHLB is currently subject to a Consent Order issued by its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nA change in federal monetary policy could adversely impact our mortgage banking revenues.\nThe Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the supply of money in the United States, and as a result its monetary policies strongly influence our costs of funds for lending and investing as well as the rate of return we are able to earn on those loans and investments, both of which impact our net interest income and net interest margin. The Federal Reserve Board's interest rate policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, including debt securities and mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs. These monetary policies can also negatively impact our borrowers, which in turn may increase the risk that they will be unable to pay their loans according to the terms or be unable to pay their loans at all. We have no control over the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board and cannot predict when changes are expected or what the magnitude of such changes may be.\nFor example, as a result of the Federal Reserve Board's concerns regarding continued slow economic growth, the Federal Reserve Board, in 2008 implemented its standing monetary policy known as \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d a program involving the purchase of mortgage backed securities and United States Treasury securities, the volume of which was aligned with specific economic targets or measures intended to bolster the U.S. economy. Although the Federal Reserve Board has ended quantitative easing, it still holds the securities purchased during the program and, if economic conditions worsened, could revive that program.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenues and our net income historically have been, and in the foreseeable future are expected to be, derived from gain on the origination and sale of mortgage loans and on the continuing servicing of those loans, the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policies may have had the effect of supporting higher revenues than might otherwise be available. If the rebound in employment and real wages is not adequate to offset the termination of the program, or if the\nFederal Reserve begins selling off the securities it has accumulated, we may see a reduction in mortgage originations throughout the United States, and may see a corresponding rise in interest rates, which could reduce our mortgage origination revenues and in turn have a material adverse impact upon our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from residential mortgage lending which is a market sector that experiences significant volatility.\nA substantial portion of our consolidated net revenues (net interest income plus noninterest income) are derived from originating and selling residential mortgages. Residential mortgage lending in general has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods. An increase in interest rates in the second quarter of 2013 resulted in a significant adverse impact on our business and financial results due primarily to a related decrease in volume of loan originations, especially refinancings. The Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates may rise again as early as June 2015. Any such increase in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our future loan origination volume, margins, and the value of the collateral securing our outstanding loans, may increase rates of borrower default, and may otherwise adversely affect our business. Additionally, in recent periods we have experienced very low levels of homes available for sale in many of the markets in which we operate. The lack of housing inventory has had a downward impact on the volume of mortgage loans that we originate. Further, it has resulted in elevated costs, as a significant amount of loan processing and underwriting that we perform are to qualifying borrowers for mortgage loan transactions that never materialize. The lack of inventory of homes for sale may continue to have an adverse impact on mortgage loan volumes into the foreseeable future.\nWe may incur losses due to changes in prepayment rates.\nOur mortgage servicing rights carry interest rate risk because the total amount of servicing fees earned, as well as changes in fair-market value, fluctuate based on expected loan prepayments (affecting the expected average life of a portfolio of residential mortgage servicing rights). The rate of prepayment of residential mortgage loans may be influenced by changing national and regional economic trends, such as recessions or depressed real estate markets, as well as the difference between interest rates on existing residential mortgage loans relative to prevailing residential mortgage rates. Changes in prepayment rates are therefore difficult for us to predict. An increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of some borrowers to pay the interest and principal of their obligations. During periods of declining interest rates, many residential borrowers refinance their mortgage loans. The loan administration fee income (related to the residential mortgage loan servicing rights corresponding to a mortgage loan) decreases as mortgage loans are prepaid. Consequently, the fair value of portfolios of residential mortgage loan servicing rights tend to decrease during periods of declining interest rates, because greater prepayments can be expected and, as a result, the amount of loan administration income received also decreases.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective hedging of interest rate risk related to our loans sold with a reservation of servicing rights.\nBoth the value our single family mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs, and the value of our single family loans held for sale changes with fluctuations in interest rates, among other things, reflecting the changing expectations of mortgage prepayment activity. To mitigate potential losses of fair value of single family loans held for sale and MSRs related to changes in interest rates, we actively hedge this risk with financial derivative instruments. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models, experienced and skilled personnel and continual monitoring. Changes in the value of our hedging instruments may not correlate with changes in the value of our single family loans held for sale and MSRs, and we could incur a net valuation loss as a result of our hedging activities. Following the expansion of our single family mortgage operations in early 2012 through the addition of a significant number of single family mortgage origination personnel, the volume of our single family loans held for sale and MSRs has increased. The increase in volume in turn increases our exposure to the risks associated with the impact of interest rate fluctuations on single family loans held for sale and MSRs.\nChanges in fee structures by third party loan purchasers and mortgage insurers may decrease our loan production volume and the margin we can recognize on conforming home loans, and may adversely impact our results of operations.\nCertain third party loan purchasers revised their fee structures in the third quarter of 2013 and increased the costs of doing business with them. For example, certain purchasers of conforming loans, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, raised costs of guarantee fees and other required fees and payments. These changes increased the cost of mortgages to consumers and the cost of selling conforming loans to third party loan purchasers which in turn decreased our margin and negatively impacted our profitability. Additionally, the FHA raised costs for premiums and extended the period for which private mortgage insurance is required on a loan purchased by them. Additional changes in the future from third party loan purchasers may have a negative impact on our ability to originate loans to be sold because of the increased costs of such loans and may decrease our profitability with respect to loans held for sale. In addition, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the\nsecondary market or the underwriting criteria of these third party loan purchasers could negatively impact our results of business, operations and cash flows.\nIf we breach any of the representations or warranties we make to a purchaser or securitizer of our mortgage loans or MSRs, we may be liable to the purchaser or securitizer for certain costs and damages.\nWhen we sell or securitize mortgage loans in the ordinary course of business, we are required to make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Our agreements require us to repurchase mortgage loans if we have breached any of these representations or warranties, in which case we may be required to repurchase such loan and record a loss upon repurchase and/or bear any subsequent loss on the loan. We may not have any remedies available to us against a third party for such losses, or the remedies available to us may not be as broad as the remedies available to the purchaser of the mortgage loan against us. In addition, if there are remedies against a third party available to us, we face further risk that such third party may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available to us. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces remedies against us, we may not be able to recover our losses from a third party and may be required to bear the full amount of the related loss.\nIf repurchase and indemnity demands increase on loans or MSRs that we sell from our portfolios, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIf we breach any representations or warranties or fail to follow guidelines when originating a FHA/HUD-insured loan or a VA-guaranteed loan, we may lose the insurance or guarantee on the loan and suffer losses, pay penalties, and/or be subjected to litigation from the federal government.\nWe originate and purchase, sell and thereafter service single family loans that are insured by FHA/HUD or guaranteed by the VA. We certify to the FHA/HUD and the VA that the loans meet their requirements and guidelines. The FHA/HUD and VA audit loans that are insured or guaranteed under their programs, including audits of our processes and procedures as well as individual loan documentation. Violations of guidelines can result in monetary penalties or require us to provide indemnifications against loss or loans declared ineligible for their programs. In the past, monetary penalties and losses from indemnifications have not created material losses to the Bank. As a result of the housing crisis, the FHA/HUD has stepped up enforcement initiatives. In addition to regular FHA/HUD audits, HUD's Inspector General has become active in enforcing FHA regulations with respect to individual loans and has partnered with the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") in filing lawsuits against lenders for systemic violations. The penalties resulting from such lawsuits can be much more severe, since systemic violations can be applied to groups of loans and penalties may be subject to treble damages. The DOJ has used the Federal False Claims Act and other federal laws and regulations in prosecuting these lawsuits. Because of our significant origination of FHA/HUD insured and VA guaranteed loans, if the DOJ were to find potential violations by the Bank, we could be subject to material monetary penalties and/or losses, and may even be subject to lawsuits alleging systemic violations which could result in treble damages.\nWe may face risk of loss if we purchase loans from a seller that fails to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nWe generally receive representations and warranties from the originators and sellers from whom we purchase loans and servicing rights such that if a loan defaults and there has been a breach of such representations and warranties, we may be able to pursue a remedy against the seller of the loan for the unpaid principal and interest on the defaulted loan. However, if the originator and/or seller breach such representations and warranties and does not have the financial capacity to pay the related damages, we may be subject to the risk of loss for such loan as the originator or seller may not be able to pay such damages or repurchase loans when called upon by us to do so. Currently, we only purchase loans from WMS Series LLC, an affiliated business arrangement with certain Windermere real estate brokerage franchise owners.\nSome provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of Washington law may deter takeover attempts, which may limit the opportunity of our shareholders to sell their shares at a favorable price.\nSome provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our shareholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests, or to effect changes in control. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nA classified board of directors so that only approximately one third of our board of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022\nElimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nProcedures for advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals;\n\u2022\nThe ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\nThe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as the board of directors may determine.\nIn addition, as a Washington corporation, we are subject to Washington law which imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.", "PERMNO": 13278, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HMST"}
