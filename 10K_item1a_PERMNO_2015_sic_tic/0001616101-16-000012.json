{"cik": "1616101", "company": "Symmetry Surgical Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. We believe the risks described below are the material risks that we face. However, the risks described below may not be the only risks that we face. Additional unknown risks, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial condition. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the price of our common stock could decline. Some of these risks include:\n\u2022\nThe potential impact of an increase in prices we pay for our products or decrease in the prices that we may charge for them;\n\u2022\nSymmetry Surgical\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain financing on reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nSymmetry Surgical\u2019s ability to adapt to a shift in technologies or methods used in surgery;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in demand for Symmetry Surgical\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nSymmetry Surgical\u2019s ability to maintain contracts with its large customers and dealers; and\n\u2022\nSymmetry Surgical\u2019s ability to operate as a micro-cap public company.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nOur Supply Agreement with SMI will expire after five years and prices may increase after two years.\nWe have historically procured goods and services from SMI through internal agreements that now are formalized in our Supply Agreement with SMI dated August 4, 2014. As part of our separation from SMI on December 5, 2014, we entered into a five-year supply agreement for products which they supply to us and we supply to them. We have limited revenue resulting from sales to SMI. The current prices paid by us for SMI\u2019s products were frozen for two years from the date of the Supply Agreement, after that time, prices will adjust to a pre-set SMI\u2019s \u201ccost plus 25%,\u201d and will be in place for three additional years. Were the day of the Spin-Off's mix and volume to be subject to this price increase, and if we were not able to find alternative, lower cost providers, we would have incurred approximately $1,000 of incremental expenses for products during 2015. Management believes that mix and volume has and will continue to change over the coming year, and that the current projected impact could instead be between $500 and $700 if were unable to find alternative, lower cost providers. There is no guarantee that we will be able to re-source this volume at a lower cost, nor that the mix and volume impact will not be greater or that prices will not rise further after the expiration of the Supply Agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nLoss of a large GPO contract, a proprietary hospital system contract, a large U.S. dealer or a significant, country-specific international distributor (or their poor performance) could adversely affect revenue and could adversely affect our business.\nWe maintain positive relationships with several GPOs and large proprietary hospital systems. As these organizations continue to pursue cost reduction opportunities, they may demand contractual concessions which we are not willing to accept or they may consolidate their purchases into one or more suppliers, excluding us in the process. Additionally, inside the U.S. we are represented in some significant geographic areas by independent dealers and outside the U.S. we sell through country-specific distributors, either of whom may also demand contractual concessions which may be undesirable for us in that market, may perform poorly or may decide to terminate their relationships with us. While we believe we could pursue other dealers and distributors in local and global markets and engage GPO or hospital system hospitals directly, the loss of their contracts would impede our ability to generate demand and revenue, or could impair our margins, and could adversely affect sales and profitability.\nA significant shift in technologies or methods used in surgery could make our products obsolete or less attractive or enable surgical procedures to move to a site of care in which we do not have a significant presence.\nThe development of new technologies could reduce or shift demand for our products. For example, new surgical procedures such as natural orifice surgery or growth in robotic surgery and the associated increase in demand for proprietary surgical instruments could reduce demand for our surgical instruments. New sterilization methods could also limit the demand for our sterilization cases. Adoption of advanced or differentiated energy forms could similarly reduce demand for our electro-surgery instruments. Provider concerns with infection associated with reusable instruments or the shift to using only single use instruments could reduce demand for our reusable instruments. Any of these or other shifts in technologies or methods used in surgery could adversely affect demand for our products. Additionally, the re-use/reprocessing of single use surgical instruments could reduce demand for traditional reusable instruments and place pricing pressure on some instrument products, leading to reduced revenue.\nThe development of new technologies or greater patient and insurer acceptance of non-hospital or office-based surgical interventions could result in a shift in site of care, reducing demand for our products or shifting demand to customers or distributors with whom we have little experience, resulting in reduced revenue, demand or pricing pressure.\nThe medical device industry and surgical instrument segment in which we operate is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies.\nThe medical device industry is intensely competitive. We compete with subsidiaries of larger, more established medical device companies as well as smaller, private companies and international manufacturers that purport to provide low-cost solutions for our primary customers. Many of our competitors have access to greater financial, technical, research and development, marketing, manufacturing, sales, distribution, administrative, consulting and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be more effective in marketing or pricing or contracting, and may have a longer history of developing, sourcing, and gaining regulatory approval of products. Our competitors may be also able to gain market share by offering lower-cost products or by offering larger bundles of products across additional clinical areas, or by entering into sole-source agreements with customers, to our exclusion.\nOur success will depend on our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, innovate new products that meet market needs, implement sourcing and production plans, execute commercial plans, gain regulatory approval for products under development, obtain Intellectual Property protection and source or produce products consistently in sufficient quantities to meet demand. We must compete against current technologies on the market as well as respond to new innovations brought by existing or unknown competitors. We may need to invest in clinical or health economic research to support our technologies and may not be as well-resourced or effective in our research as our competition. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may not realize all of the revenue expected from new products we develop or those we distribute.\nWe incur expenses in developing and testing new products and related medical devices. These expenses are projected to continue to increase. Our realization of additional revenue from new product development efforts is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including, directly or indirectly, end-user acceptance of the product, reimbursement approval of the product or the procedure in which it is used by third-party payers such as Medicaid, Medicare and private insurers and, in some cases, FDA or comparable foreign regulatory approval of the product. In addition, our customers typically have no contractual requirement to purchase the products that we develop from us. We also incur costs for new product development and production based upon certain estimates of volume for our existing and anticipated products. If the actual demand for our products is less than planned, our revenue and net income may decline.\nWe also enter into contractual relationships with Alliance Partners under which we distribute products for third parties. The initial work to develop customer acceptance of these products, as well as the sales cycle for new products can divert our attention from current products, or result in reduced sales if these efforts are not successful. In addition, we may purchase inventories of Alliance Partners products which may not sell, or which may sell at lower than anticipated prices, in each case potentially resulting in reduced revenues and profits.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, our suppliers or our customers our business may be harmed.\nThe manufacture and sale of our healthcare and other products exposes us and our suppliers to potential product liability claims and product recalls, including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of, or design or manufacturing flaws in, our products, or use of our products with components or systems not manufactured by us. Product liability claims or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or otherwise require us to pay significant damages or costs of settlement, which could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. Such lawsuits or claims against our suppliers could also impair our supply of products or increase the prices we must pay for\nthem. The product liability insurance that we carry is limited in scope and amount and may not be adequate to protect us against the full extent of costs or damages related to product liability claims. Further, significant litigation or adverse awards could render us unable to maintain this insurance at reasonable costs and on reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe rely on our independent sales dealers, sales representatives, and international distributors to market and sell our products and their efforts, success or decisions to transition to other product lines or employers could adversely impact our business.\nOur success in both the U.S. and international markets depends largely upon marketing arrangements with independent sales dealers (U.S.), sales representatives (U.S.), and international distributors (outside U.S.) under which we receive their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace. Any of these partners may terminate their relationships with us or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products. We do not control our independent dealers or international distributors, and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans. Our failure to maintain our existing relationships with our independent dealers, sales representatives, or international distributors could have an adverse effect on our operations. We have experienced turnover with some of our independent sales dealers and international distributors in the past, which adversely affected short-term financial results while we transitioned to new independent sales dealers and international distributors. While we believe these transitions have been managed effectively, similar occurrences could happen in the future, with different results, which could have a greater adverse effect on our operations than we have previously experienced.\nOur operating results are subject to significant potential fluctuation and historical results should not be relied on as an indication of our future results.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year in the future due to a combination of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe number, timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements achieved by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\npotential acquisitions by us or any acquisition of our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing policies by us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in medical treatment or regulatory practices;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by the regulatory approval process for our new products;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet customer demand for certain products or types of products;\n\u2022\ndecisions regarding the utilization of our manufacturing assets;\n\u2022\nsignificantly changing quality and regulatory requirements mandated by the FDA and/or our customers;\n\u2022\ndisruption in our supply network or demand greater than supply; and\n\u2022\navailability and cost of raw materials.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance. We cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period. Any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period.\nIf we do not retain and/or attract key individuals, skilled professionals and sales representatives we may not be able to operate successfully, and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives.\nOur success depends in part upon the retention of key managerial, sales and technical personnel, financial professionals, and skilled supply chain professionals and operators. We and our key suppliers, dealers and distributors compete for such personnel with other companies and organizations, many of which are larger and have greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we or our key suppliers, dealers. and distributors do. Many of these competitors are located in the same geographic areas in which our current operations are located or can attract personnel to work virtually globally or relocate. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel, or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future. The loss by us, our suppliers, dealers or distributors of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully. We also do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, senior management or other key personnel, so we could incur financial costs associated with their death or disability related to paying obligations to their estates and replacing them, as well as operating without their abilities.\nOur efforts to differentiate our products in the marketplace with breadth, innovation, intellectual property, quality, service, education/training, or branding may fail, resulting in reduced demand for our products.\nOur comprehensive portfolio, complemented by our commercial efforts, generates demand in the marketplace. Should we fail to differentiate ourselves with portfolio breadth, product innovation, patented technologies, and quality, demand for our products could erode. We must continue to have a broad offering of proprietary products as well as Alliance Partners products offered on behalf of other manufacturers that are complementary in nature. In 2015, Alliance Partners products represented 9.0% of our sales. In May 2014, an Alliance Partner ended its contract with us with respect to its New Wave products. Relationships with our Alliance Partners are dynamic in nature and while we have contractual agreements in place, there is no guarantee that this revenue cannot be lost with or without compensation due to acquisition of the manufacturer by another party, termination of the relationship by either party, or other factors. The loss of any or all of such products, or inability to replace such products, could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe depend on suppliers, and in some cases a single third-party supplier, and our key suppliers in turn can depend on a single supplier, for key products and raw materials. The loss of these sources or our inability to source a product from a new supplier in a timely fashion should the need arise due to demand or supplier performance could harm our business. Additionally, commodity price fluctuations in key metals and plastics could impact profitability.\nWe sell products which are sourced from specific manufacturers. Additionally the products we sell are made of plastic, titanium, stainless steel and various other raw materials. While we generally believe that the raw materials used in our products are readily available from multiple sources, from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor. Additionally, our suppliers will sometimes, in turn, rely on a limited number of raw material suppliers. For example, our supply chain requires the supply of a patented Radel\u00ae R plastic, which is designed to withstand the intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations, for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases. This plastic is sourced from a single supplier. Further, some of our raw materials are produced in areas of the world that are subject to political and other disruptions that could impair the supply of raw materials to our suppliers or the supply of their products to us. Any supply interruption in a limited or sole-sourced component or raw material could materially harm our ability to produce or source our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found. Further, our efforts to cover such materials could be costly and impair our ability to meet our contractual obligations for certain products on a profitable basis, if at all. Additionally, while the finished products we procure can often be sourced from multiple vendors, sourcing of products from a new supplier can often take significant time to allow for appropriate development, knowledge transfer, quality certification and regulatory approvals, thus making it difficult to respond rapidly to disruptions. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. This challenge could interrupt our business, cause us to become involved in litigation with suppliers or customers, impair our profitability and/or reduce the quality, price or availability of our products. In addition, changes in manufacturing or supply processes may require regulatory approval, which could delay the production and sale of the products we manufacture and source.\nIf our suppliers experience issues with their ability to supply the products we require, raise the price of those products (including as a result of global commodity price increases), or otherwise impair our ability to obtain the products, it would impair our ability to sell our products to our customers and impact our sales and profit. We source a large number of products under the Supply Agreement with SMI, and plan to continue to do so for several years. If SMI experiences issues with its ability to supply the products we require, raises the price of those products upon termination of the two-year price freeze in the Supply Agreement, or otherwise impairs our ability to obtain the products, it would delay or prevent products from reaching our customers or result in our prices increasing, all negatively impacting sales and profit.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrevenue generated by sales of our products;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in acquiring, manufacturing and selling our products;\n\u2022\ncosts of developing new products or technologies;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with capital expenditures;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our expansion;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with regulatory compliance, including maintaining compliance with the quality system regulations imposed by the FDA;\n\u2022\nthe number, cost and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nworking capital requirements related to growing new acquisitions or existing business;\n\u2022\nexpansion of our international or domestic facilities; and\n\u2022\ncosts associated with litigation, judicial or administrative awards or other legal issues that arise.\nAs a result of these factors, we may need to raise additional funds, and these funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business strategy, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements, or we could be unable to continue our business operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property and property rights, or are subject to intellectual property claims by third parties, our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our technologies and products. Additionally, we share a significant amount of intellectual property with SMI through our cross license agreement. We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that they will deter infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any litigation could result in substantial expenses and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may result in our loss of those rights. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all, and we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries. If our trade secrets become known, we may lose the competitive advantages associated with them.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology, in part, with confidentiality agreements with our employees, independent dealers and distributors and customers. We cannot be certain, however, that:\n\u2022\nthese agreements will not be breached;\n\u2022\nthese agreements will be enforced by a court or other judicial body;\n\u2022\nwe will have adequate remedies for any breach; or\n\u2022\ntrade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors through an undiscovered breach of an agreement or otherwise.\nIn addition, third parties may claim that we are infringing, misappropriating or violating their intellectual property rights. We could be found to infringe those intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to manufacture any affected product. In addition, any litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could require substantial financial resources, divert the time and effort of our management and cause customers to delay or limit their purchases of the affected product until resolution of the litigation.\nAny litigation or claims against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and could harm our reputation. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, which could adversely affect our revenue;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022\nre-design or, in the case of trademark claims, rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may not be possible and could be costly and time-consuming if it is possible to do so.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our foreign operations.\nWe have significant international operations and we continue to expand and grow these operations. We have operations in Switzerland and Germany and sales into approximately 100 countries worldwide through local market distributors. Certain risks are inherent in international operations that could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or profitability, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nforeign customers who may have longer payment cycles than do our customers in the U.S.;\n\u2022\ntax rates in certain foreign countries may exceed those in the U.S. and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in countries where we operate or where end users of our products reside;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental approaches to foreign industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax, training or other incentives upon which we relied (or rely) in deciding to do business in a particular country;\n\u2022\nwars, insurrections or other strife;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncompliance obligations under a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with complex international laws and regulations.\nIf a natural or man-made disaster (including cyber-attacks) strikes one or more of our offices, procurement/distribution facilities, key suppliers\u2019 facilities, our information technology infrastructure or software, or our global carrier network we may be unable to manufacture/procure certain products or receive, process, ship and deliver customer orders for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on the support of our information technology systems. Our global business operations reside on a central enterprise resource planning system and internal server network. Failure of this system, the reliability of the data maintained in it, our telephony infrastructure, or our customer connectivity could result in significant disruption to our business. In addition, despite our security measures and our best attempts, our systems may be damaged by cyber-attacks, viruses, disasters, hackers, hardware failure, power failure or other disruptions. Any significant disruption could adversely affect our ability to operate efficiently, which could negatively impact our sales and profits.\nOur facilities or those of our key suppliers may be affected by natural or man-made disasters. In the event that one or more of our facilities, or those operated by a key supplier, were affected by a disaster, we would be forced to attempt to shift sourcing to another source or rely on third-party manufacturers, who may or may not have the capability to effectively supply the affected products. We provide global distribution from our Nashville, Tennessee facility. Should a disaster strike this facility, we would be forced to attempt to shift distribution to another facility in the U.S. or Europe, which could adversely affect our ability to ship and invoice product for a substantial time period and potentially increase costs associated with distribution. Destruction of this facility could also result in our credit agreement being terminable by the lender. Disruptions to the global transportation network could also affect our ability to procure ship and invoice products. Although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages, other labor matters, or new labor laws.\nCurrently, our U.S. and Swiss facilities are not unionized and we are not aware of any employee consideration of or efforts to become unionized. Our German facility is represented by a works council pursuant to applicable local country laws and regulations. While we have not experienced any adverse effects from work stoppages or slow-downs, work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by us, our suppliers, or their suppliers could result in the interruption of production at facilities where our products are made or used. We cannot assure you that we will not encounter strikes, further unionization efforts, new labor laws, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business as a whole.\nWe are subject to complex and costly regulation that can increase costs or impair our ability to bring products to market.\nOur products are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other national, federal and state governmental authorities in the U.S. and abroad. It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory clearance and/or approval to market medical products. Clearance and/or approval might not be granted for a new or modified device or other product on a timely basis, if at all. Regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action or interpretation, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. Unless an exception applies, the FDA requires that the manufacturer of new medical products or a new indication for use of, or other significant change in, an existing medical device\nobtain either 510(k) pre-market notification clearance or pre-market approval before those products can be marketed or sold in the U.S. Modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the product, technology, materials, labeling, packaging, or manufacturing process may also require a new 510(k) clearance.\nIn addition, we are subject to regulations covering manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising, and adverse-event reporting that apply after we have obtained clearance or approval to sell a product. Our failure to maintain clearances or approvals for existing products, to obtain clearance or approval for new or modified products, or to adhere to regulations for manufacturing, labeling, advertising or adverse event reporting could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we determine a product manufactured or marketed by us does not meet our specifications, published standards or regulatory requirements, we may seek to correct the product or withdraw the product from the market, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Many of our facilities and procedures, and those of our suppliers, are subject to ongoing oversight, including periodic inspection by governmental authorities. Compliance with production, safety, quality control and quality assurance regulations can be costly and time-consuming.\nThe sales and marketing of medical products is coming under increased scrutiny by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and enforcement bodies, including but not limited to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, state anti-kickback laws and the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act. If our sales and marketing activities fail to comply with FDA regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings or enforcement actions from the FDA or other enforcement bodies.\nCompetitor and distributor consolidation could adversely affect demand and pricing, which could adversely affect our business.\nCompetitor consolidation may increase downward pricing pressure as a consequence of the resulting larger competitor\u2019s greater product and service offerings or its ability to purchase or supply on a more cost-efficient scale. Distributor consolidation, domestically or in specific countries, may increase margin pressure or reduce our revenue, either of which could impact our operating results.\nOur commercial efforts may not be successful.\nWe rely upon our ability to provide products to customers on competitive quality, clinical education/training, service, differentiated innovation, price, and quantity terms. If our sales efforts are unable to bring our value proposition to our customers, customers may consider competitive products. Some of our customers utilize a single or small group of suppliers and may choose to rationalize their supplier base if our commercial team does not successfully execute our value proposition. Further, we may be unable to secure distribution rights for products required by our customers, causing them to consolidate their purchasing with competitors who are able to provide such broader array of products. If any of these events should occur, it would impair our direct sales business and cause a decline in revenue and profit.\nEfforts to acquire additional companies or product lines may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations, and if we complete additional acquisitions, we may incur or assume additional liabilities or experience integration problems resulting in a failure to realize the anticipated benefits.\nIn addition to internally generated growth, our current strategy involves growth through acquisitions. In the future, we may seek to acquire additional businesses or product lines for various reasons, including in order to obtain new product manufacturing capabilities, add new customers, increase penetration with existing customers or expand into new geographic markets. Our ability to successfully grow through additional acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing.\nWe may be unable to continue to implement our acquisition strategy or the strategy we implement ultimately may be unsuccessful. We intend to pursue the acquisition of businesses and product lines complementary to our own; both products which are consistent with those we sell today as well as medical device adjacencies in the hospital environment. Acquisitions could range in size from a single product to a large product family to an entirely new clinical line which, if consummated, could be significant to us.\nIf we pursue and/or complete acquisitions, we may experience the following, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results:\n\u2022\nmaterial transaction expenses;\n\u2022\ndebt or increased interest and amortization expense;\n\u2022\nincreased depreciation expense;\n\u2022\nincreased operating expense;\n\u2022\nincreased capital investment;\n\u2022\npossible in-process research and development charges for acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a \u2018\u2018business;\u2019\u2019\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating any acquired companies, personnel and products into our existing business;\n\u2022\ndelays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nlimited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;\n\u2022\nhigher costs of integration than we anticipated;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies;\n\u2022\nloss of customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nlitigation and/or other disputes brought with the acquired business could result in negative consequences; and\n\u2022\nadverse customer reaction to such acquisition.\nSome acquisition target businesses or products may not have adequate financial, disclosure, regulatory, quality or other compliance controls at the time we acquire them. As we grow by acquisition, we must manage any new businesses to integrate them into our systems for financial, disclosure, compliance, regulatory and quality control, realize synergies, and control costs. Acquisitions also involve other risks, including diversion of management resources otherwise available for execution and development of our business and risks associated with entering clinical or geographic markets in which our commercial and product development teams have limited experience or where experienced distribution partners are not available.\nOur ability to develop our resources to adapt to new products or business areas and to identify and enter into or maintain satisfactory distribution networks for new acquisitions will in part determine our future success. We may fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future, obtain acceptable financing or consummate an acquisition. If we cannot integrate acquired operations, manage the cost of providing our products or price our products appropriately, our profitability and return on investment could suffer. In addition, as a result of our acquisitions of other medical device products or businesses, we may be subject to the risk of unanticipated uncertainties, regulatory and other compliance matters or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not indemnify us, for which we may not be able to obtain insurance (or adequate insurance), or for which the indemnification provided may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate liabilities.\nOur earnings would be negatively impacted if we write off goodwill or intangible assets created as a result of our various acquisitions.\nWe have accumulated goodwill amounting to $9,341 as of January 2, 2016, or 6% of our total assets as of such date. Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment by us annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances develop that would likely result in impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal or business climate, an adverse regulatory action, or unanticipated competition or financial restatements. Additional acquisitions could result in increased risk of further impairments.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we did impair certain definite-lived intangible assets aggregating $1,014. We conducted our annual impairment test and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. During fiscal 2014, impairment charges were an aggregate of $55,817 for goodwill and other assets. These charges are recorded in the consolidated and combined statements of operations within asset impairment. See Note 7 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information.\nIf we are unable to continue to improve our current products, develop new products or achieve customer quality expectations, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products, our products could become obsolete, or we may incur higher costs in attempts to respond to customer expectations.\nWe sell our products to customers in markets that are characterized by technological change, product innovation and evolving industry standards and expectations. We are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs, both in collaboration with our customers and independently. In addition, our competitors may produce products that are more appealing to our customers and thereby impair our ability to compete effectively with them. Our competitors\u2019 product development capabilities could also become more effective than ours, and their new products may get to market before our products, may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete. Compliance with the lengthy regulatory process may impair our ability to develop innovative products, as well as our ability to do so on a commercially effective timeline. If our customers change or increase quality expectations or requirements, and we are unable to achieve them, whereas\nour competitors are, we may lose volume and revenue. Additionally, we may significantly increase our costs in attempts to achieve product quality expectations. If one or more of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nCertain minerals that are mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries are restricted from use in manufacturing our products, and the Company is required to investigate its supply chain to confirm that there are no such minerals used in its products. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the potential cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These requirements may increase our cost for products or render some products less marketable.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenue and financial results.\nWe incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We have operations in Switzerland and Germany, as well as sales to many countries worldwide. While our sales to international customers are in U.S. dollars, their purchases may be affected by the cost of acquisition. Currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to, among other things, changes in local, regional or global economic conditions, the imposition of currency exchange restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments. Exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our margins and financial results.\nIf we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals to commercially distribute our future products our ability to sell our products could suffer.\nSome of our products are subject to rigorous regulatory pre-approval by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. We are responsible for obtaining the applicable regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our products. The process of obtaining this approval, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will obtain the required approvals on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA, for example, assigns medical devices to one of three classes which determine, among other things, the type and degree of FDA approval required to commercially distribute the device in the U.S. We produce Class I, II and III devices. Class I devices are deemed to present little risk to patients and are generally exempt from FDA approval requirements. Class II devices can generally be commercially distributed only after the device has received 510(k) clearance. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if certain design, testing and validation requirements are met and it is demonstrated that the device is \u2018\u2018substantially equivalent\u2019\u2019 to a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, or to another commercially available device subsequently cleared through the 510(k) Pre-Market Notification process. This process generally takes three to six months, but recently has taken substantially longer, up to nine months or more, due to increased review time and scrutiny\nof requirements to assure safe and effective products for consumers. Before a Class III device can be commercially distributed in the U.S., a pre-market approval, or PMA, must be obtained from the FDA. The PMA process can be expensive and uncertain, requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and other data and generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The commercial distribution of any products we develop that require regulatory clearance may be delayed. In addition, because we cannot assure you that any new products or any product enhancements we develop for commercial distribution in the U.S. will be exempt from the FDA market clearance requirements or subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, the regulatory approval process for our products or product enhancements may take significantly longer than anticipated by us or our customers. In addition, our products are or will be required to have a Universal Device Indicator on the package and device by 2018. If we are unable to achieve these labeling requirements our product distribution could be restricted, impairing our operations and financial condition. Similarly, we may incur significant costs in complying with this requirement, which could negatively impact our pricing to customers or our revenue.\nAny claims in excess of our insurance coverage limits may result in substantial costs and a reduction in our available capital resources.\nWe maintain a wide array of insurance coverage, including property insurance policies covering physical damage to our equipment, facilities, buildings and inventory; employer\u2019s liability insurance generally covering our employees\u2019 workplace death or injury; product liability insurance covering product liability claims arising from the use, consumption or operation of our products; general liability insurance covering certain incidents to third parties that occur on or in our premises; business interruption insurance, and directors and officers liability insurance, among others. Our insurance coverage, however, may not be sufficient to cover all claims or coverage may be denied or unavailable in certain circumstances. As we expand our sales\nefforts into multiple international countries and product categories such expansion could increase the risk of claims that may not be covered sufficiently, if at all, by our policies of insurance.\nWe may experience difficulties, delays, performance impacts or unexpected costs from facility infrastructure changes or outsourcing.\nWe regularly evaluate the location and function of our facilities. In the future, we may be required to consolidate, move or outsource our operations in order to improve our cost structure, achieve increased operating efficiencies, and improve our competitive standing or results of operations and/or to address unfavorable economic conditions. We may also lose favorable tax incentives or not be able to renew a lease on acceptable terms, resulting in the need to consolidate or relocate. As part of these actions, we may further reduce staff, make changes to certain capital projects, close certain operations or abandon leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our operations. In conjunction with any actions, we will continue to make significant investments and build the framework for our future growth and business continuity. We may not realize, in full or in part, all of the anticipated benefits and savings from these efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to achieve or maintain all of the resulting savings or benefits to our business or other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nImplementation and achievement of our growth objectives may be impeded by political, social, and economic uncertainties or unrest in countries in which we conduct operations or market or distribute our products. In addition, compliance with multiple, and potentially conflicting, international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, anti-corruption laws, and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome or expensive.\nWe have significant international efforts and we continue to expand and grow these operations. We have operations in Switzerland and Germany and sales into many countries worldwide through local market distributors. Should disruptions, including those related to political or economic circumstances in those countries occur, or should there be unrest, social disruption, terrorist attacks, political upheaval, revolutions, wars or conflicts, they may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States and similar anti-bribery laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot assure you that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics and our training and monitoring efforts. The occurrence or allegation of violations of these laws or regulations may result in legal action against our Company or our employees and the consequences thereof, as well as the cost of addressing such a claim, could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the negative impact of social media and customer/market perception.\nWe utilize social media to provide an information channel to customers, prospective customers, employees, and investors. Despite our best efforts, we may be adversely affected by negative commentary generated (accurate or not) by other users of social media. This may adversely affect our reputation, the reputation of our brands, and customer perception, any or all of which could negatively impact our sales and profits.\nWe may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could incur fines, penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Environmental laws tend to become more stringent over time, and we could incur material expenses in the future relating to compliance with future environmental laws. In addition, we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. Such costs could be material.\nFuture levels of indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business, finance acquisitions and pursue new business strategies.\nOur possible future indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to obtain additional financing (or maintain current levels of financing) in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmake us susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates that affect the cost of our borrowings to the extent that our variable rate debt is not covered by interest rate derivative agreements; and\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to pursue strategic acquisitions, alliances and collaborations.\nOur ability to service any future indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, including but not limited to all of the factors and risks discussed herein. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Our ability to service any future indebtedness also relies on certain assumptions including, among others, that we will continue to be successful in implementing our business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our other obligations and commitments, we may be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. If necessary, we cannot be certain that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations in the future, the risks associated with our indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase.\nFailure to satisfy the obligations and maintain compliance with our lending agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur lending arrangement includes various restrictive covenants where compliance is essential for credit availability. We may be unable to comply with the financial ratios or covenants and, if we fail to do so, we may be unable to obtain waivers from our lender. Failure to comply with any payment or compliance requirements of our debt would entitle the lender to, among other things, accelerate the maturity or terminate the availability of credit commitments. Such an action could render our business unsustainable.\nOur credit agreement and future lending agreements may contain restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt, make acquisitions and make other investments.\nOur Credit Agreement includes customary covenants for facilities of its type, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, investments and acquisitions, loans and advances, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, and dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments. If we are successful in obtaining additional financing in the future, any such lending agreement into which we enter may similarly contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders or other payments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios. These lending agreements may also contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, invest in our foreign operations, acquire other businesses and make capital expenditures and impose various other restrictions. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncost of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrevenue generated by sales of our products;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in manufacturing and selling our products;\n\u2022\ncosts of developing new products or technologies;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with capital expenditures;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our expansion;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with regulatory compliance, including maintaining compliance with the quality\n\u2022\nsystem regulations imposed by the FDA;\n\u2022\nthe number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nworking capital requirements related to growing new acquisitions or existing business;\n\u2022\nexpansion of our international or domestic facilities; and\n\u2022\ncosts associated with litigation, judicial or administrative awards or other legal issues that arise.\nAs a result of these factors, we may need to raise additional funds, and these funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business strategy, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business is subject to healthcare industry cost containment measures and other industry trends affecting pricing that could result in reduced sales of, or prices for, our products.\nAcceptance of our products by hospitals, outpatient centers, physicians and other customers depends on, among other things, reimbursement approval of third-party payers such as Medicaid, Medicare and private insurers (or other governmental and non-governmental sources outside the United States). The continuing efforts of government, insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to lower reimbursement rates or non-reimbursement for medical procedures that use our products or for our products themselves. As that occurs, customers might insist that we lower prices on products related to the affected medical device or they might significantly reduce or eliminate their purchases from us of such products. We also have relationships with GPOs which negotiate pricing for member hospitals, and which require price discounts for certain products. Pricing pressure from all of the foregoing sources may have an impact on our financial results.\nChanges in the healthcare industry may eliminate or reduce the size of the market for our products, which could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nIn the United States the movement toward managed care and healthcare cost containment, as well as other global government and private sector initiatives in markets in which we do business, are placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective care that could adversely affect the sale and/or the prices of our products. Examples of potentially problematic movements include:\n\u2022\na trend toward site of care outside the tertiary hospital where our resources are mainly focused;\n\u2022\nalignment of physicians with healthcare institutions, reducing physician preference and increasing commoditization of our products;\n\u2022\nreduced funding constraining capital and operating budgets at our customers\u2019 businesses; and\n\u2022\ngainsharing proposals, physician profiling, and collaboration with service providers which could alter current standards of care.\nReduced hospital or operating room construction and customer consolidation could adversely affect demand and pricing, which could adversely affect our business.\nMany healthcare providers are consolidating to create new companies that possess greater regional or national market power. As the healthcare industry continues to consolidate, our customers may delay purchases or reduce their future needs as they integrate operations and consolidate facilities/operating rooms. Customer consolidation may also impact demand for our products, as the consolidated company implements centralized procurement to reduce inventory. Larger customers may increase pricing pressure. Additionally, reduced capital budgets in the U.S. or decreased government funding abroad could result in fewer new hospital constructions or the addition of operating rooms to existing hospitals which would reduce large tender opportunities and reduce sales opportunities.\nSignificant changes to U.S. federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations that apply to our operations and activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the U.S., U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. For example, our effective tax rate reflects the impact of our Schaffhausen, Switzerland global supply chain operations and undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended\nto be invested indefinitely outside the U.S. Substantial changes in U.S. tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe full impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act on our business remains uncertain.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the \u201cPPACA\u201d) continues to significantly impact the medical device industry, and its terms and date(s) of effective regulations remain uncertain. For example, PPACA imposed a 2.3% excise tax on all domestic sales of medical devices after December 31, 2012. In 2015 and 2014, we incurred $847 and $767, respectively in excise tax, which was included as a general and administrative expense. The tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017 although there is no guarantee that the suspension will continue (or that it will not return at a higher figure). We determine revenue subject to the excise tax on the basis of which entity is the registered owner of the device, the first sale in the U.S. and other factors. With the exception of revenue growth and product mix subject to the excise tax, we do not expect a material change in our excise tax responsibility going forward, although some excise tax that was paid by SMI prior to the Spin-Off may be shifted to us under the terms of our Supply Agreement and is already reflected in our pricing agreements to the extent it is re-implemented. We cannot predict with certainty whether regulators will implement any changes to the excise tax or the ultimate effect of any changes to the excise tax or the federal health care reform in general will have on us when fully implemented. Specifically, unless and until the law and associated regulations are finalized, fully implemented and not subject to further legislative efforts to modify or overturn them, we are unable to accurately estimate the future impact of the PPACA on our business, as its continued implementation could lead to an impact on our customers\u2019 business, including surgical volumes, hospital construction or capital spending. The legislation could have a material adverse effect on our customers\u2019 businesses and our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany significant parts of the law will be phased in during the next decade and require further clarification in the form of regulations. As a result, many impacts will not be known until those regulations are enacted (if at all).\nEffective August 1, 2013, certain manufacturers of medical devices covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program who make payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, including us, were required to begin tracking and reporting such payments and transfers under the regulations known as the National Physician Payment Transparency Program. Efforts to comply with these requirements on an ongoing basis may result in an increase in operational expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities. Failure to comply fully could cause us to incur costs and expenses associated with remedial compliance or fines (or both).\nChanging laws and increasingly complex corporate governance and public disclosure requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards, including those relating to corporate governance and public disclosure such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and recently enacted and proposed SEC regulations, have created additional compliance requirements for companies such as ours. These include, but are not limited to, the reporting of the use of conflict minerals. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in operational expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock may be volatile and could decline substantially.\nThere has been volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the medical device industry, which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nloss of any of our key management or technical personnel;\n\u2022\nconditions affecting the medical device industry generally;\n\u2022\nproduct liability lawsuits against us or our customers;\n\u2022\nclinical trial results with respect to our or our suppliers' or customers\u2019 medical devices;\n\u2022\nchanges in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding our patents or proprietary rights, or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nFDA and international actions with respect to the government regulation of medical devices and third-party reimbursement practices;\n\u2022\npublic concern as to the safety of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in health care policy in the U.S. and internationally;\n\u2022\nconditions in the financial markets in general or changes in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nour inability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or the medical device industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and five percent stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nthe announcement of financial restatements.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities or financial restatements, litigation has often been brought against that company. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could be extremely expensive, not covered by insurance (in full or in part) and divert management\u2019s attention and the Company\u2019s resources.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or management.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions through which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nrequiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal the by-laws; and\n\u2022\nauthorizing the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock and common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nWe are also protected by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a 15.0% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or stockholder approvals were obtained.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions for so long as we are an emerging growth company, which could be as long as five years following the completion of the Spin-Off. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less\nattractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We chose to \"opt in\" to the extended transition period, and as a result, we may delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Our financial statements, therefore, may not be comparable to those companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nOther General Risks.\nOur future viability and profitability is also dependent on a number of other factors that affect the performance of all industries and not just the medical device industry, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\u2022\nfinancial failure or default by a party to any contract to which we are, or may become, a party;\n\u2022\ninsolvency or other managerial failure by any of our customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nindustrial disputes;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters; and\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism or an outbreak of international hostilities.", "PERMNO": 15090, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "SSRG"}
