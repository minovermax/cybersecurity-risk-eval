We encourage our stockholders to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Form 10-K\nin their entirety for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from our recent results or from our anticipated future results.\nRisks related to the commercialization of Firdapse\u00ae\n\u2022\nWe depend substantially on the commercial success of Firdapse\u00ae\n.\n\u2022\nOur business may in the future require additional capital.\n\u2022\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to successfully commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\n. We are primarily a single product company with limited commercial experience, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business, predict our future prospects and forecast our financial performance and growth.\n\u2022\nWe have limited experience as a company in marketing or distributing pharmaceutical products. If we are unable to expand our marketing capabilities and effectively commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\n, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nOur business is subject to substantial competition.\n\u2022\nOur recently adopted strategy of seeking to acquire or in-license\ninnovative technical platforms or earlier stage drug development programs outside of the neuromuscular disease space may not be successful.\n\u2022\nThe obligations incident to being a public company place significant demands on our management.\n\u2022\nWe are highly dependent on our small number of key personnel and advisors.\n\u2022\nThe ongoing COVID-19\npandemic and the worldwide attempts to contain it could harm our business and results of operations and financial condition and could be adversely impacted by it.\n\u2022\nWe face a risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance.\n\u2022\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm our development efforts and increase our costs and expenses.\nRisks Related to the Development of Additional Indications for Firdapse\u00ae\n\u2022\nOur efforts may fail.\n\u2022\nFailure can occur at any stage of our drug development efforts.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical\nstudies and clinical studies and trials, and if they do not perform their obligations to us we may not be able to obtain approval for additional indications.\n\u2022\nWe will need to continue to develop and maintain distribution and production capabilities or relationships to be successful.\n\u2022\nIf we rely on a sole source of supply to manufacture our products we could be impacted by the viability of our supplier.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to sufficiently scale-up\nmanufacturing of our drug candidates.\n\u2022\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nPressure on drug product third-party payor coverage, reimbursement and pricing may impair our ability to be reimbursed at prices or on terms sufficient to provide a viable financial outcome.\n\u2022\nWe cannot assess the impact on our business of the public concerns expressed by a U.S. Senator and a vocal group of neuromuscular physicians and patients with LEMS about our pricing of our drug product.\n\u2022\nBecause the target patient populations for Firdapse\u00ae\nand our other drug candidates are small, we must achieve significant market share and obtain relatively high per-patient\nprices for our products to achieve meaningful gross margins.\n\u2022\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our contract research organizations and other key vendors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\n\u2022\nOur employees, sales agents and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\n\u2022\nThe regulatory approval process is lengthy, and we may not be able to obtain all of the regulatory approvals required to manufacture and commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\nfor additional indications.\n\u2022\nIf our pre-clinical\nstudies or our clinical studies and trials are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, our ability to commercialize our products will be impaired.\n\u2022\nWe may face significant delays in our clinical studies and trials due to an inability to recruit patients for our clinical studies and trials or to retain patients in the clinical studies and trials we may perform.\n\u2022\nIf our third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers do not maintain appropriate standards of manufacturing in accordance with cGMP and other manufacturing regulations, our development and commercialization activities could suffer significant interruptions or delays.\n\u2022\nEnacted and future legislation or judicial action may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\non any other drug candidates we develop, and affect the prices we may obtain.\n\u2022\nFirdapse\u00ae\nis subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing United States and applicable foreign regulations, we could lose those approvals, and our business would be severely harmed.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to obtain or subsequently maintain orphan drug exclusivity or regulatory exclusivity for Firdapse\u00ae\nand our other orphan drug candidates, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions at greatly reduced prices, and our revenues would be significantly adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe cannot guarantee that the design of, or data collected from, that trial or any of our clinical trials conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) will be sufficient to support filing or approval of an NDA.\n\u2022\nOur operations and relationships with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, customers and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-bribery, anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to, among other things, enforcement actions, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on our relationships and license agreements, and we rely upon the patent rights granted to us pursuant to the license agreements.\n\u2022\nOur success will depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\n\u2022\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nThere are also general risk factors relating to us that you should consider that relate to our business and to our common stock.\nRisk Factors\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, and all of the other information contained in this Form 10-K\nin assessing the risks relating to ownership of our common stock. The risks described below could cause our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects to materially suffer and the market price of our stock to decline.\nRisks related to the commercialization of Firdapse\u00ae\nWe depend substantially on the commercial success of Firdapse\u00ae\n.\nUntil we launched Firdapse\u00ae\nfor the treatment of LEMS in January 2019, we focused all of our efforts on obtaining regulatory approval for Firdapse\u00ae\nfor the treatment of LEMS, on evaluating Firdapse\u00ae\nfor the treatment of other neuromuscular diseases including CMS, MuSK-MG\nand SMA Type 3, on raising capital, and on recruiting personnel. On November 28, 2018, the FDA approved our first product, Firdapse\u00ae\nfor the treatment of adults with LEMS, which became commercially available in January 2019. While we reported net income of $75.0 million for fiscal 2020 and $31.9 million for fiscal 2019, we have a prior history of operating losses in all prior fiscal years of our existence. There can be no assurance that we will remain profitable.\nOur business may in the future require additional capital.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future in order to fund our business and generate significant revenue in order to achieve and maintain profitability. If necessary, we would likely raise additional funds in the future through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations, or other means. We may also seek governmental grants to support our clinical and pre-clinical trials. However, there is no assurance that any such funding will be available, and, even if it is available, whether it will be available on terms that are favorable to us. We may also seek to raise additional capital to fund additional product development efforts, even if we have sufficient funds for our planned operations.\nAny sale by us of additional equity or debt securities convertible into additional equity could result in dilution to our stockholders. Further, to the extent that we raise funds through collaborative arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or grant sublicenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are not able to secure funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to successfully commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\n. We are primarily a single product company with only limited commercial experience, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business, predict our future prospects and forecast our financial performance and growth.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources into the development and commercialization of our lead product, Firdapse\u00ae\n, which was approved by the FDA as a treatment for adults with LEMS on November 28, 2018. Our success depends on our ability to effectively commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\n, and we expect that the vast majority of our product revenues in the foreseeable future will be from sales of Firdapse\u00ae\n. Successful commercialization of Firdapse\u00ae\nis subject to many risks. Until we launched Firdapse\u00ae\n, we had never launched or commercialized a product, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to be profitable based on our sales of Firdapse\u00ae\n. There are numerous examples of unsuccessful product launches and failures to meet high expectations of market growth potential, including by pharmaceutical companies with more resources and experience than we have. The commercial success of Firdapse\u00ae\ndepends on the extent to which patients and physicians accept and adopt Firdapse\u00ae\n. For example, if the expected patient population is smaller than we estimate or if physicians are unwilling to prescribe or patients are unwilling to take Firdapse\u00ae\n, or if patients discontinue from use of the medication at rates that are higher than we expect, or if payers decide not to reimburse for our product, the commercial potential of Firdapse\u00ae\nwill be limited. Thus, significant uncertainty remains regarding the ultimate commercial potential of Firdapse\u00ae\n.\nMoreover, our ability to effectively generate product revenue from Firdapse\u00ae\nwill depend on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncompete successfully with Ruzurgi\u00ae\n, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals\u2019 version of amifampridine;\n\u2022\nbe successful in our suit against the FDA seeking to maintain our exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act for treating LEMS patients;\n\u2022\neducate patients and physicians successfully about efficacy expectations, side effects expectations, and how to successfully dose and titrate the medication to optimal patient benefit in order to minimize discontinuation due to perceived lack of efficacy or side effects;\n\u2022\nachieve and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, including those related to our required post-approval studies, promotion and advertising requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease awareness for and achieve market acceptance of Firdapse\u00ae\nthrough our sales and marketing activities and other arrangements established for the promotion of Firdapse\u00ae\n;\n\u2022\ntrain, deploy, support, and retain a qualified field sales and marketing force;\n\u2022\nsecure continued formulary approvals for Firdapse\u00ae\nwith a substantial number of targeted payors;\n\u2022\nensure that our third-party manufacturers manufacture Firdapse\u00ae\nin sufficient quantities, in compliance with requirements of the FDA and at acceptable quality and pricing levels, in order to meet commercial demand;\n\u2022\nensure that our third-party manufacturers develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations;\n\u2022\nimplement and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nensure that our entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers Firdapse\u00ae\nto our customers;\n\u2022\nprovide co-pay\nassistance to help qualified patients with out-of-pocket\ncosts associated with their Firdapse\u00ae\nprescription, and/or other programs to ensure patient access to our products, educate physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of Firdapse\u00ae\n, and obtain acceptance of Firdapse\u00ae\nas safe and effective by patients and the medical community;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for Firdapse\u00ae\nfrom commercial health plans and governmental health programs;\n\u2022\ngenerate positive experience with our Catalyst Pathways\u2122\nprogram in helping patients obtain access to Firdapse\u00ae\nat an acceptable patient out-of-pocket\ncost;\n\u2022\nmaintain quality relationships with patient advocacy groups;\n\u2022\ninfluence the nature of publicity related to our product relative to the publicity related to our competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory approvals for additional indications for the use of Firdapse\u00ae\nin treating other rare neuromuscular diseases.\nAny disruption in our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of Firdapse\u00ae\nwill have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have limited experience as a company in marketing or distributing pharmaceutical products. If we are unable to continue to successfully commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\n, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur strategy is to continue to successfully commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\nin the United States. While we have established our commercial team and launched our product, we have limited experience commercializing pharmaceutical products as an organization. In order to successfully market Firdapse\u00ae\n, we must continue to build our sales, marketing, managerial, compliance, and related capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we are unable to continue to have adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to appropriately commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\nand may not become profitable.\nThere are risks involved both with maintaining our own sales and marketing capabilities, and with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, any efforts to maintain a direct sales and marketing organization are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe expense and time required to recruit, retain, and motivate members of the sales force;\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, retain or motivate adequate numbers of effective marketing personnel and partner marketing agencies;\n\u2022\nthe inability to provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe expense and time required to monitor regulatory compliance;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or convince adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any product; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nSimilarly, as we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenue or the profitability associated with any product revenue may be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We may have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. Moreover, we may be negatively impacted by other factors outside of our control relating to such third parties, including, but not limited to, their inability to comply with regulatory requirements. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.\nFinally, because we are using a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies to distribute our product, if the organizations that we work with to deliver our drug do not perform in a lawful manner or have issues unrelated to our business, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to substantial competition.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs and more experience developing products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and manufacturing and marketing products than we have. We compete against pharmaceutical companies that are developing or currently marketing therapies that will compete with us. In addition, we compete against biotechnology companies, universities, government agencies, and other research institutions in the development of pharmaceutical products. Our business could be negatively impacted if our competitors\u2019 present or future offerings are more effective, safer or less expensive than ours, or more readily accepted by regulators, healthcare providers or third-party payors. Further, we may also compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities.\nEven with the FDA approval of Firdapse\u00ae\n, the bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient in the drug (i.e., amifampridine) may be used by compounding pharmacies pursuant to Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the ingredient is a component of an FDA-approved\ndrug product, and pharmacies may lawfully compound for individually identified patients under Section 503A using components of approved drug products. In addition, drugs that are not approved by FDA for the treatment of LEMS, such as a related aminopyridine drug, dalfampridine (Ampyra\u00ae\n), may nonetheless be prescribed by physicians for the treatment of LEMS.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully.\nOur recently adopted strategy of seeking to acquire or in-license\ninnovative technical platforms or earlier stage drug development programs outside of the neuromuscular disease space may not be successful.\nOn January 6, 2021, we announced an expansion in our strategic focus to include acquiring or in-licensing\ninnovative technology platforms and earlier stage programs in other therapeutic categories outside of neuromuscular diseases. We are evaluating opportunities to in-license\nor acquire products, product candidates and technologies on a selective and targeted basis. Our business development efforts may fail to result in our acquiring rights to additional products, product candidates or technologies, or may result in our consummating transactions with which you do not agree.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate is lengthy and complex, and we may be unable to in-license\nor acquire the rights to any such products, product candidates or technologies from third parties for several reasons. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select and acquire or in-license\npromising product candidates and technologies.\nThe in-licensing\nand acquisition of pharmaceutical products is an area characterized by intense competition, and a number of companies (both more established and early stage biotechnology companies) are also pursuing strategies to in-license\nor acquire product candidates or technologies that we may consider attractive. We believe that other companies may be particularly active in pursuing opportunities to in-license\nor acquire the same or similar products which we may seek to acquire. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater research, preclinical or clinical development or commercialization capabilities, while earlier stage companies may be more aggressive or have a higher risk tolerance. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to in-license\nor acquire the rights to the relevant product candidate or technology on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing\nopportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts or we may incorrectly judge the value of an acquired or in-licensed\nproduct candidate or technology.\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates or technologies, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer. In addition, acquisitions and in-licensing\narrangements for product candidates and technologies are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition or license transaction or integrate an acquired or licensed product candidate or technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition or license to the extent anticipated and the perception of the effectiveness of our management team and our company may suffer in the marketplace. In addition, even if we are able to successfully identify, negotiate and execute one or more transactions to acquire or in-license\nnew product candidates or technologies, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity.\nIn addition, acquisitions and in-licenses\nmay entail numerous operational, financial and legal risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to known and unknown liabilities, including possible intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, tax liabilities and commercial disputes;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nrestructuring charges related to eliminating redundancies or disposing of assets as part of any such combination;\n\u2022\nlarge write-offs and difficulties in assessing the relative percentages of in-process\nresearch and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount that must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses or, in the event that we write down the value of acquired assets, impairment losses;\n\u2022\npotential failure of the due diligence process to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired or licensed product candidate or technology, including problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, partner disputes or issues and other legal and financial contingencies and known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nentry into therapeutic modalities, indications or markets in which we have no or limited direct prior development or commercial experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions.\nThe obligations incident to being a public company place significant demands on our management.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including periodic reports, disclosures and more complex accounting rules. As directed by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in their Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on current rules, we are required to annually report under Section 404(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley regarding our management\u2019s assessment as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Further, under Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley, our auditors are required to report on their assessment as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we or our auditors are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock.\nWe are highly dependent on our small number of key personnel and advisors.\nWe are highly dependent on our officers and key employees and on our Board of Directors. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could significantly impede the achievement of our scientific and business objectives. Other than an employment agreement with Patrick J. McEnany, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer with respect to his services, we have no employment or retention agreements with any of our other officers or key employees. If we lose the services of any of our existing officers or key employees, or if we were unable to recruit qualified replacements on a timely basis for persons who leave our employ, our efforts to develop our drug candidates might be significantly delayed. We do not carry key-man\ninsurance on any of our personnel.\nThe ongoing COVID-19\npandemic and the worldwide attempts to contain it could harm our business and results of operations and financial condition and could be adversely impacted by it.\nThe ongoing global outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19,\nand the various attempts throughout the world to contain it, have created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption. The COVID-19\npandemic has had, and may continue to have, significant effects on our operations. There can be no assurance as to whether and how long these effects will last and whether following the pandemic whatever trends have occurred will not remain in place and continue to affect our business.\nWe face a risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that may arise from the clinical testing, manufacture, and/or sale of our pharmaceutical products. Patients have received substantial damage awards in some jurisdictions against pharmaceutical companies based on claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of pharmaceutical products used in clinical trials or after FDA approval.\nLiability claims may be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments against us. We currently carry liability insurance that we believe to be adequate. Our insurance may not reimburse us for certain claims or the coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims made against us. We cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our current drug candidates, or any potential future products we may acquire and use in clinical trials or after FDA approval and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur. If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our products, our liability could exceed our ability to pay the liability. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any adverse litigation, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and stock price.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm our development efforts and increase our costs and expenses.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our ongoing or planned research and development activities. Global health concerns, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, clinical trial sites, regulators and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted. It is also possible that global health concerns such as the COVID-19\npandemic could disproportionately impact the hospitals and clinical sites in which we conduct any of our clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Development of Additional Indications for Firdapse\u00ae\nOur efforts may fail.\nDevelopment of additional indications for Firdapse\u00ae\nis subject to risks of failure. For example:\n\u2022\nFirdapse\u00ae\nmay be found to be ineffective or unsafe for one or more additional indications, or fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nFirdapse\u00ae\nmay not be economical to market or take substantially longer to obtain necessary approvals for additional indications than anticipated; or\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop and market equivalent or superior products, including next generation products that act with the same mechanism of action as Firdapse\u00ae\n.\nAs a result, our drug development activities may not result in any safe, effective and commercially viable additional indications, and we may not be able to commercialize our products successfully. For example, for several years, we evaluated Firdapse\u00ae\nfor the treatment of CMS, MuSK-MG\nand SMA Type 3. However, Firdapse\u00ae\nfailed to meet the primary endpoints in a Phase 3 trial for CMS and we are no longer pursing this indication. Further, and even though we achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint in our proof-of-concept\ntrial for SMA Type 3 the lack of robust results in this trial has caused us to decide to no longer pursue this indication. Finally, our Phase 3 clinical trial (MSK-002)\nevaluating Firdapse\u00ae\nfor the treatment of adults with MuSK-MG\ndid not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint or its secondary endpoint even though clinical improvement was observed by patients and investigators during the initial dose-titration period of the trial and in the company\u2019s previous proof-of-concept\ntrial. We plan to redesign a Phase 3 study that may better demonstrate the efficacy of our drug for the treatment of MuSK-MG\nand discuss it with FDA during the first half of 2021. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will either grant a meeting, agree with our protocol design or, even if the study is successful, accept the results of a single study of a different trial design as sufficient evidence for approval of the MuSK-MG\nindication.\nOur failure to develop safe, effective, and/or commercially viable products would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure can occur at any stage of our drug development efforts.\nWe will only obtain regulatory approval to commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\nfor additional indications if we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA (or the equivalent foreign regulatory authorities) in adequate and well-controlled clinical studies and trials that the drug is safe and effective for its intended use, that the clinical and other benefits outweigh the safety risks and that it otherwise meets approval requirements. As we have experienced in the past, a failure of one or more pre-clinical\nor clinical trials or studies can occur at any stage of drug development. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, testing that could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for, or commercializing our drug candidates, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulators or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nconditions may be imposed upon us by the FDA regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials, or we may be required to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for review due to changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nthe number of subjects required for our clinical trials may be larger, patient enrollment may take longer, or patients may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may have to suspend or terminate one or more of our clinical trials if we, regulators, or IRBs determine that the participants are being subjected to unreasonable health risks;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors, clinical investigators or contractual collaborators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not accept clinical data from trials that are conducted at clinical sites in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;\n\u2022\nour tests may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional testing; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of our pre-clinical\nand/or clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical\nstudies and clinical studies and trials, and if they do not perform their obligations to us we may not be able to obtain approval for additional indications.\nWe do not currently have the ability to independently conduct pre-clinical\nstudies or clinical studies and trials, and we typically rely on third parties, such as third-party contract research and governmental organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators (including academic clinical investigators), to conduct studies and trials for us. Our reliance on third parties for development activities reduces our control over these activities. These third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our pre-clinical\nstudies and our clinical studies and trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be adversely affected, and our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\nfor additional indications may be delayed.\nIf we conduct studies with other parties, we may not have control over all decisions associated with that trial. To the extent that we disagree with the other party on such issues as study design, study timing and the like, it could adversely affect our drug development plans.\nAlthough we also rely on third parties to manage the data from our studies and trials, we are responsible for confirming that each of our studies and trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies will require us to comply with applicable regulations and standards, including Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), for conducting, recording and reporting the results of such studies and trials to assure that the data and the results are credible and accurate and that the human study and trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third-parties does not relieve us of these obligations and requirements, and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval for any additional indications if these requirements are not met.\nWe will need to continue to develop and maintain distribution and production capabilities or relationships to be successful.\nWe are licensed in Florida as a virtual drug manufacturer, which means we have no in-house\nmanufacturing capacity and we will be obligated to rely on contract manufacturers and packagers. We cannot be sure that we will successfully manufacture any product, either independently or under manufacturing arrangements, if any, with third party manufacturers. Moreover, if any manufacturer should cease doing business with us or experience delays, shortages of supply or excessive demands on their capacity, we may not be able to obtain adequate quantities of product in a timely manner, or at all. Manufacturers, and in certain situations their suppliers, are required to comply with current NDA commitments and current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements enforced by the FDA, and similar requirements of other countries. The failure by a manufacturer to comply with these requirements could affect its ability to provide us with product. Although we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMP. In addition, if, during a preapproval inspection or other inspection of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facility or facilities, the FDA determines that the facility is not in compliance with cGMP, any of our marketing applications that lists such facility as a manufacturer may not be approved or approval may be delayed until the facility comes into compliance with cGMP and completes a successful re-inspection\nby the FDA.\nAny manufacturing problem, natural disaster, or epidemic, affecting manufacturing facilities, or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally, we will be reliant on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our products. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to future contract manufacture caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of products, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales. If our suppliers were to be unable to supply us with adequate supply of our drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\nIf we rely on a sole source of supply to manufacture our products we could be impacted by the viability of our supplier.\nWe intend to attempt to source our products from more than one supplier. We also intend to enter into contracts with any supplier of our products to contractually obligate them to meet our requirements. However, if we are reliant on a single supplier and that supplier cannot or will not meet our requirements (for whatever reason), our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to sufficiently scale-up\nmanufacturing of our drug candidates.\nWe may not be able to successfully increase in a sufficient manner the manufacturing capacity for our drug candidates, whether in collaboration with third-party manufacturers or on our own, in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. If a contract manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our drug candidates, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to those improvements.\nSignificant scale-up\nof manufacturing may require additional validation studies, which are costly and which the FDA must review and approve. In addition, quality issues may arise during those scale-up\nactivities because of the inherent properties of a drug candidate itself or of a drug candidate in combination with other components added during the manufacturing and packaging process, or during shipping and storage of the finished product or active pharmaceutical ingredients. If we are unable to successfully scale-up\nmanufacture of any of our drug candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development of that drug candidate and regulatory approval or commercial launch for any resulting drug products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nTo manage future growth, we will need to hire, train, and manage additional employees. Concurrent with expanding our operational and marketing capabilities, we will also need to increase our product development activities. We may not be able to support, financially or otherwise, future growth, or hire, train, motivate, and manage the required personnel. Our failure to manage growth effectively could limit our ability to achieve our goals.\nOur success in managing our growth will depend in part on the ability of our executive officers to continue to implement and improve our operational, management, information and financial control systems, and to expand, train and manage our employee base, and particularly to expand, train and manage a specially-trained sales force to market our products. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition for such personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, universities and non-profit\nresearch institutions. Our inability to manage growth effectively could cause our operating costs to grow at a faster pace than we currently anticipate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPressure on drug product third-party payor coverage, reimbursement and pricing may impair our ability to be reimbursed at prices or on terms sufficient to provide a viable financial outcome.\nThe commercial success of Firdapse\u00ae\nwill continue to depend substantially on the extent to which the cost of Firdapse\u00ae\nwill be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities (such as Medicare and Medicaid), private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to continue to successfully commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\n. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to establish and maintain pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment.\nOur ability to commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\nor any other product candidate will depend in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. These payors may not view our products as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers, or may not be sufficient to allow our products, if any, to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues. If the prices for our products decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nThere may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.\nIn addition, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nThe pricing of pharmaceutical products, in general, and of specialty drugs, in particular, has been a topic of concern in the United States Congress, where hearings have been held on the topic, and several bills have been introduced proposing a variety of actions to restrain the prices of drugs. Former President Trump frequently discussed his intention to reduce drug prices, as has President Biden. The former Administration solicited public comment on a variety of regulatory proposals to reduce drug prices, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published an interim final rule that establishes a Most Favored Nation (MFN) Model for Medicare Part B drug payment. This regulation would substantially change the drug reimbursement landscape as it bases Medicare Part B payment for 50 selected drugs on prices in foreign countries instead of average sales price, or ASP. The MFN drug payment amount is expected to be lower than the current ASP-based\npayment limit because U.S. drug prices are generally the highest in the world. Although the MFN Model payment methodology was scheduled to begin on January 1, 2021, it faces uncertain prospects for implementation. By the end of December 2020, three federal courts had granted orders preventing implementation of the MFN Model rule. The likelihood of implementation of any of the former Administration reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the recent change in administration on January 20, 2021 and the new administration\u2019s silence to date on these issues. We cannot predict how any such laws or regulations, or new laws or regulations that have yet to be proposed, will affect the pricing of our product, of orphan drugs generally, or of pharmaceutical products generally.\nWe cannot assess the impact on our business of the public concerns expressed by a U.S. Senator and a vocal group of neuromuscular physicians and patients with LEMS about our pricing of our drug product.\nIn February 2019, we received a letter from Senator Bernie Sanders asking us to justify our pricing decision for Firdapse\u00ae\n. In the letter, Senator Sanders accuses us of \u201cfleecing\u201d Americans and \u201cimmoral exploitation\u201d because of our decision regarding the pricing of Firdapse\u00ae\n. We responded to Senator Sanders, who issued a public statement in response asking then-FDA\nCommissioner Scott Gottlieb to allow pharmacies and manufacturers who were previously making this drug to be permitted to resume providing it.\nThere can be no assurance as to how these matters will affect our business or results of operations.\nWe are also aware that the vocal group of neuromuscular physicians and a number of LEMS patients who have raised these issues in the past are continuing to raise concerns with the pricing of our product and with the appropriateness of the provisions in the Orphan Drug Act that grant us exclusivity for Firdapse\u00ae\n. A few of these patients continue to say negative things about us to the media, to other patients, to the FDA, and to politicians. We cannot assess the impact of these activities on our business.\nBecause the target patient populations for Firdapse\u00ae\nand our other drug candidates are small, we must achieve significant market share and obtain relatively high per-patient\nprices for our products to achieve meaningful gross margins.\nFirdapse\u00ae\ntargets diseases with small patient populations. A key component of the successful commercialization of a drug product for these indications includes identification of patients and a targeted prescriber base for the drug product. Due to small patient populations, we believe that we would need to have significant market penetration to achieve meaningful revenues and identifying patients and targeting the prescriber base are key to achieving significant market penetration. Typically, drugs for conditions with small prevalence have higher prices in order to generate a return on investment, and as a result, the per-patient\nprices at which we anticipate we may sell Firdapse\u00ae\nwill need to be relatively high in order for us to generate an appropriate return for the investment in these product development programs and achieve meaningful gross margins, and high per patient prices could drive physicians to seek out compounding pharmacies to provide compounded amifampridine to fill their prescriptions rather than Firdapse\u00ae\n, thereby lowering the Firdapse\u00ae\nmarket share or penetration in the market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving a sufficient degree of market penetration and/or obtaining or maintaining high per-patient\nprices for Firdapse\u00ae\nfor diseases with small patient populations. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for Firdapse\u00ae\n, because the potential target populations are very small, we may not be able to maintain profitability despite obtaining such significant market share. Additionally, patients who discontinue therapy or do not fill prescriptions are not easily replaced by new patients, given the limited patient population.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our contract research organizations and other key vendors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our contract research organizations and other key vendors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our drug candidates could be delayed.\nOur employees, sales agents and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, sales agents or consultants. Misconduct could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process is lengthy, and we may not be able to obtain all of the regulatory approvals required to manufacture and commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\nfor additional indications.\nWe will not be able to commercialize our products in other countries or for additional indications until we have obtained the requisite regulatory approvals from applicable governmental authorities. To obtain regulatory approval of a drug candidate for an indication, we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory agency that such drug candidate is safe and effective for that indication. The type and magnitude of the testing required for regulatory approval varies depending on the drug candidate and the disease or condition for which it is being developed. In addition, in the United States we must show that the facilities used to manufacture our drug candidates are in compliance with cGMP requirements. We will also have to meet similar regulations in any foreign country where we may seek to commercialize our drug candidates. In general, these requirements mandate that manufacturers follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures throughout the entire manufacturing process. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals typically takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial capital and other resources. Despite the time, expense and resources invested by us in the approval process, we may not be able to demonstrate that our drug candidate is safe and effective for such indications, in which event we would not receive the regulatory approval required to market it.\nThe FDA and other regulatory authorities generally approve products for particular indications. Firdapse\u00ae\nmay not be approved for any or all of the indications that we request, which would limit the indications for which we can promote it and adversely impact our ability to generate revenues. We may also be required to conduct costly, post-marketing follow-up\nstudies if FDA or other regulatory authorities request additional information.\nIf our pre-clinical\nstudies or our clinical studies and trials are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, our ability to commercialize our products will be impaired.\nBefore we can obtain future regulatory approval for the sale of our drug candidates for an indication, we may have to conduct, at our own expense, pre-clinical\ntests in animals in order to support the safety of our drug candidates. Pre-clinical\ntesting is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take several years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. Our pre-clinical\ntests may produce negative or inconclusive results, and on the basis of such results, we may decide, or regulators may require us, to halt ongoing clinical trials or conduct additional pre-clinical\ntesting.\nAdditionally, future clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be successfully completed or may take longer than anticipated because of any number of factors, including potential delays in the start of the trial, an inability to recruit clinical trial participants at the expected rate, failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy, unforeseen safety issues, or unforeseen governmental or regulatory delays. Further, our drug candidate may not be found to be safe and effective in particular indications and may not be approved by regulatory authorities for the proposed indication. Further, regulatory authorities and IRBs that must approve and monitor the safety of each clinical study may suspend a clinical study at any time if the patients participating in such study are deemed to be exposed to any unacceptable health risk. We may also choose to suspend human clinical studies and trials if we become aware of any such risks. We might encounter problems in our clinical trials, including our expanded access program, such as seizures, weakness or other side effects that will cause us, regulatory authorities, or IRBs to delay or suspend such trial or study. Moreover, FDA will consider the data, including safety data, from patients enrolled in our expanded access program in the evaluation of any NDA or sNDA we may submit for Firdapse\u00ae\n.\nIn other countries where Firdapse\u00ae\n, or any other product we develop or license may be marketed, we will also be subject to regulatory requirements governing human clinical studies, trials and marketing approval for drugs. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement varies widely from country to country.\nWe may face significant delays in our clinical studies and trials due to an inability to recruit patients for our clinical studies and trials or to retain patients in the clinical studies and trials we may perform.\nWe may encounter difficulties in our current and future clinical studies and trials recruiting patients, particularly since the conditions we are studying are rare, orphan conditions. The availability of approved therapies can also make enrollment difficult. We compete for study and trial subjects with others conducting clinical trials testing other treatments for the indications we are studying for our drug candidates. Further, unrelated third parties and investigators in the academic community have in the past and we expect will continue in the future to test our drug candidates, including Firdapse\u00ae\n.\nIf these third-party tests are unsuccessful, or if they show significant health risk to the test subjects, our development efforts may also be adversely affected.\nClinical trials in orphan diseases are often difficult to enroll given the small number of patients with these diseases. Completion of orphan clinical trials may take considerably more time than other trials, sometimes years, depending on factors such as type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. As a result of the uncertainties described above, there can be no assurance that we will meet timelines that we establish for any of our clinical trials.\nIf our third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers do not maintain appropriate standards of manufacturing in accordance with cGMP and other manufacturing regulations, our development and commercialization activities could suffer significant interruptions or delays.\nWe rely, and intend to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide us with materials for our clinical trials and commercial-scale production of our products. These suppliers and manufacturers must continuously adhere to cGMP as well as any applicable corresponding manufacturing regulations outside of the United States. In complying with these regulations, we and our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort in the areas of design and development, testing, production, record-keeping, and quality control to assure that our products meet applicable specifications and other regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in an enforcement action against us, including warning letters, the seizure of products, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, shutting down of production, and criminal prosecution. Any of these third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers will also be subject to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. If any of our third-party suppliers or contract manufacturers fail to comply with cGMP or other applicable manufacturing regulations, our ability to develop and commercialize our products could suffer significant interruptions and delays.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nreliance on the continued financial viability of the third parties;\n\u2022\nlimitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of the third parties;\n\u2022\nimpact on our reputation in the marketplace if manufacturers of our products fail to meet the demands of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nIf any of our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain appropriate manufacturing standards, patients using our products could be injured or die, resulting in product liability claims. Even absent patient injury, we may be subject to product recalls, product seizures or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing or delivery, cost overruns, or other problems that could seriously harm our business or profitability.\nFirdapse\u00ae\nis subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing United States and applicable foreign regulations, we could lose those approvals, and our business would be severely harmed.\nWe are and will continue to be subject to continuing regulatory review for our approved products, including the review of our required nonclinical and clinical post-marketing studies, and other clinical results which are reported after our drug candidates become commercially available approved drugs. As greater numbers of patients use a drug following its approval, side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated during preapproval clinical studies and trials. In addition, the manufacturer, and the manufacturing facilities we use to make any approved drugs, will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drug, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the drug, manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the drug from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension, or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions.\nOur product promotion and advertising are also subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. In particular, the marketing claims we will be permitted to make in labeling or advertising regarding our marketed products will be limited by the terms and conditions of the FDA-approved\nlabeling and available scientific data. We must submit copies of our advertisements and promotional labeling to the FDA at the time of initial publication or dissemination. If the FDA believes these materials or statements promote our products for unapproved indications, or with unsubstantiated claims, or if we fail to provide appropriate safety related information, the FDA could allege that our promotional activities misbrand our products. Specifically, the FDA could issue an untitled letter or warning letter, which may demand, among other things, that we cease such promotional activities and issue corrective advertisements and labeling to all recipients of the misbranded materials. The FDA also could take enforcement action including seizure of allegedly misbranded product, injunction, or criminal prosecution against us and our officers or employees. If we repeatedly or deliberately fail to submit such advertisements and labeling to the agency, the FDA could withdraw our approvals. Moreover, the Department of Justice can bring civil or criminal actions against companies and executives that promote drugs or biologics for unapproved uses, based on the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the False Claims Act, and other federal laws governing the marketing and reimbursement for such products under federally supported healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Monetary penalties in such cases have often been substantial, and civil penalties can include costly mandatory compliance programs and potential exclusion of a company\u2019s products from federal healthcare programs.\nEnacted and future legislation or judicial action may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\nor any other drug candidates we develop, and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of court cases, legislative and regulatory changes, and other potential changes relating to the healthcare system that restrict or regulate post-approval activities, which may affect our ability to profitably sell Firdapse\u00ae\nor any other drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient drug purchases by those covered by Medicare under a new Part D and introduced a reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies whereby they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, there is additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of the MMA could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products, and could seriously harm our business. Manufacturers\u2019 contributions to this area, including donut hole coverage (as described below) or potential excise taxes, are increasing and are subject to additional changes in the future.\nIn 2010, former President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the \u201cHealth Care Reform Law\u201d), a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional health policy reforms. The Health Care Reform Law, among other things, revised the definition of Average Manufacturer Price used by the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states and extended the rebate program to beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. The Health Care Reform Law also imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products and established an annual non-deductible\nfee on entities that sell branded prescription drugs or biologics to specified government programs in the United States. The Health Care Reform Law also expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), including the creation of new penalties for non-compliance\nand included a discount (now 70%, on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole.\u201d The Health Care Reform Law increased the Medicaid rebates for line extensions or reformulated drugs, which could substantially increase our Medicaid rebate rate (in effect limiting reimbursement for these patients).\nBeginning in January 2017, former President Trump signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. These actions include directing applicable federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Health Care Reform Law that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, an Executive Order was signed terminating the cost sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Health Care Reform Law. Several state Attorneys Generals filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018 the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12.0 billion in Health Care Reform Law risk corridor payments to third-party payors. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the Health Care Reform Law marketplace, providers, and our business, are not yet known. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Health Care Reform Law\u2019s individual mandate is unconstitutional but sent the matter back down to a district court to determine whether that provision can be removed from the rest of the Health Care Reform Law. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling, and oral argument was heard on November 10, 2020, and a decision may not be made until June 2021. President Biden has made statements regarding changes to the Health Care Reform Law, including possibly revoking some or all of former President Trump\u2019s executive orders. The likelihood of implementation of any of former President Trump\u2019s reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the recent change in administration.\nAdditionally, in response to controversies regarding pricing of pharmaceutical products, there has been a recent push to propose legislation, both on state and federal levels, that would require greater disclosure as to the reasoning behind drug prices and, in some cases, could give state or federal-level commissions the right to impose cost controls on certain drugs. These and other new provisions are likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. In that regard, President Biden and members of Congress in both parties have expressed concerns about high drug prices. However, whether and to what extent any such positions will result in changes of the law, and how any such changes could impact our business, cannot be determined at this time.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals also have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Delays in feedback from the FDA may affect our ability to quickly update or adjust our label in the interest of patient adherence and tolerability. We cannot predict whether other legislative changes will be adopted or how such changes would affect the pharmaceutical industry generally and specifically the commercialization of Firdapse\u00ae\n.\nIf we fail to obtain or subsequently maintain orphan drug exclusivity or regulatory exclusivity for Firdapse\u00ae\nand our other orphan drug candidates, our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions at greatly reduced prices, and our revenues would be significantly adversely affected.\nIn the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee\nwaivers. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the stated disease or condition for a period of seven years, with an additional six months of exclusivity if the product also qualifies for pediatric exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective, a subsequent product is deemed clinically superior, or if the manufacturer is unable to deliver sufficient quantity of the drug.\nBecause the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our drug products may be particularly limited, orphan drug designation is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible drugs, we plan to rely on the orphan exclusivity period to maintain a competitive position. However, if we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our drug candidates or we cannot maintain orphan exclusivity for our drug candidates, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition and our revenues will be reduced. Also, without strong patent protection, competitors may sell a generic version upon the expiration of orphan exclusivity if our patent position is not upheld.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug designation for our future drug candidates, we may not fulfill the criteria for exclusivity or we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any orphan indication. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a particular product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition, and FDA can approve the same drug for a different patient population. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. The FDA can discontinue orphan drug exclusivity after it has been granted if the orphan drug cannot be manufactured in sufficient quantities to meet demand.\nFinally, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity provisions currently in the law may not be changed in the future and the impact of any such changes (if made) on us. The orphan drug exclusivity contained in the Orphan Drug Act has been the subject of recent scrutiny from the press, from some members of Congress and from some in the medical community. There can be no assurance that the exclusivity granted in the Orphan Drug Act to orphan drugs approved by the FDA will not be modified in the future, and as to how any such change might affect our products, if approved.\nWe cannot guarantee that the design of, or data collected from, that trial or any of our clinical trials conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) will be sufficient to support filing or approval of an NDA.\nIn the context of a Phase 3 clinical trial, the purpose of a SPA is to reach agreement with the FDA on the protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim: in other words, if the agreed-upon clinical trial protocol is followed, the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, and there is a favorable risk-benefit profile, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of an NDA. However, FDA may rescind a SPA if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the trial began. Thus, a SPA is not binding on the FDA if, for example, the Agency identifies a safety concern related to the product or its pharmacological class, if FDA or the scientific community recognizes a paradigm shift in disease diagnosis or management, if the relevant data or assumptions provided by the sponsor in the SPA submission are found to be false or misstated, or if the sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with FDA. In addition, a SPA may be modified with the written agreement of the FDA and the trial sponsor. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of a SPA agreement and the data and results from the applicable clinical trial. Moreover, even if a clinical trial is conducted pursuant to a SPA, that does not mean that the study will be successful or, even if the study is successful, that the NDA will meet the standard for approval.\nOur operations and relationships with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, customers and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-bribery, anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to, among other things, enforcement actions, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, third-party payors, customers, and patients expose us to broadly applicable anti-bribery, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our drug candidates. In addition, we may be subject to patient data privacy and security regulation by the U.S. federal government and the states and the foreign governments in which we conduct our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state anti-bribery and healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nthe Federal health care program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits individuals and entities from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal and state healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe federal criminal and civil false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be imposed through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities, prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label\npromotion, may also violate false claims laws. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal legislation commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, with the information made publicly available on a searchable website; effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives must also be reported based on information collected during the prior year;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, which prohibits, among other things, U.S. companies and their employees and agents from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to foreign government officials, employees of public international organizations and foreign government owned or affiliated entities, candidates for foreign political office, and foreign political parties or officials thereof;\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental\nthird-party payors, including private insurers; and\n\u2022\ncertain state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug and therapeutic biologics manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf we or our collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include, not only civil and criminal penalties, but also exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs, and exclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, or reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are dependent on our relationships and license agreements, and we rely upon the patent rights granted to us pursuant to the license agreements.\nAll of our patent rights for Firdapse\u00ae\nare derived from our license agreement. In August 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) allowed U.S. Patent No. 10,793,893 (the \u2019893 patent) to our licensor and thereby to us, and the patent issued on October 6, 2020. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients, regardless of the therapeutic indication, that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section prior to April 7, 2034, the expiration date of the patent, could possibly infringe this patent. Generic drug product labels would necessarily have to do this, and we intend to take all appropriate actions to protect our intellectual property.\nWe may lose our rights to these patents and patent applications if we breach our obligations under the License Agreement, including, without limitation, our financial obligations to the licensor. If we violate or fail to perform any term or covenant of the License Agreement, the licensor may terminate the License Agreement upon satisfaction of any applicable notice requirements and expiration of any applicable cure periods. Additionally, any termination of the License Agreement, whether by us or by the licensor, will not relieve us of our obligation to pay any license fees owing at the time of such termination. If we fail to retain our rights under the License Agreement, we would not be able to commercialize Firdapse\u00ae\n, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to use patents and regulatory exclusivity to exclude others from competing with our products. The patent position of emerging pharmaceutical companies like us can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues. Until the \u2019893 patent is interpreted by a court, and unless and until our other pending applications are granted, we will not know the breadth of protection that they will afford us. Our pending applications, if granted, may not contain claims sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or marketing competing products. Third parties may intentionally attempt to design around any Firdapse\u00ae\npatents that ultimately grant so as to compete with us without infringing our patents. Although granted patents enjoy a presumption of validity, there is a risk that the \u2019893 patent and any patents resulting from our ongoing prosecution efforts may be invalidated or rendered unenforceable if challenged by others.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, we cannot be certain how much protection from competition patent rights will provide us.\nOur success will depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that we do not or will not infringe on patents held by third parties or that third parties in the future will not claim that we have infringed on their patents. In the event that our products or technologies infringe one or more patents or violate other proprietary rights of any third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing or commercializing any of our products using such technologies. For example, there may be patents or patent applications held by others that contain claims that our products or operations might be determined to infringe or that may be broader than we believe them to be. Given the complexities and uncertainties of patent laws, there can be no assurance as to the impact that future claims of infringement against us may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nIf a third party claims that we infringe its patents, any of the following may occur:\n\u2022\nwe may be preliminarily enjoined from making, using, selling, or offering to sell our allegedly infringing product by a court of competent jurisdiction in advance of any formal infringement determination;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay substantial financial damages if a court formally decides that our technologies infringe the third party\u2019s patent(s). Damages can be tripled if the infringement is deemed willful;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to discontinue or significantly delay developing, marketing, selling and licensing the allegedly infringing product(s) absent a license from the patent holder, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or which may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents; and\n\u2022\nwe may need to redesign our product so that it does not infringe the third party\u2019s patent rights, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time and require additional studies.\nIn addition, our employees, consultants, contractors and others may knowingly or unknowingly use the proprietary information of others in their work for us or disclose our proprietary information to others. If our employees, consultants, contractors or others disclose our data to others or use data belonging to others in connection with our business, it could lead to disputes over the ownership of inventions derived from that information or expose us to potential damages or other penalties.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nThere is substantial history of litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. We may be forced to defend claims of infringement brought by our competitors and others, and we may institute litigation against third parties who we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to substantial uncertainties and may, for example, turn on the interpretation of claim language by the court, which may not be to our advantage, or on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree.\nUnder our License Agreements, we have the right to bring legal action against any alleged infringers of the patents we license. In that regard, on October 19, 2020, we announced that we have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey against Jacobus and a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the specialty pharmacy marketing Ruzurgi\u00ae\n, PantherRx Rare LLC (PantherRx), for infringement of the \u2018893 Patent. The suits have since been combined in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. The lawsuit arises from Jacobus\u2019 and PantherRx\u2019s sales and marketing of Ruzurgi\u00ae\n(amifampridine, 10 mg). The lawsuit alleges that the Ruzurgi\u00ae\nproduct infringes the \u2018893 patent when administered in accordance with its product labeling. The lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief to prevent further marketing of Ruzurgi\u00ae\nin violation of our patent rights. Under our License Agreements, we are responsible for all costs relating to such potential litigation and we have the right to any proceeds received as a result of such litigation. However, even if we are successful in this or any other litigation we may file, there is no assurance we would be awarded any monetary damages.\nOur involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense to us. Some of our competitors have considerable resources available to them and a strong economic incentive to undertake substantial efforts to stop or delay us from commercializing products. Moreover, regardless of the outcome, intellectual property litigation against or by us could significantly disrupt our development and commercialization efforts, divert our management\u2019s attention and quickly consume our financial resources.\nIn addition, if third parties have filed patent applications or have issued patents claiming technology that is also claimed by us in any of our pending applications, we may be required to participate in interference or derivation proceedings with the third party at the United States Patent Office. We may also need to participate in proceedings outside the United States, such as an opposition at the European Patent Office, to determine whether or not a patent issued by the EPO was properly granted. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs, and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel will be diverted from product development or other more productive matters.\nGeneral Risk Factors Relating to our Common Stock\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and could in the future be highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. Market prices for biopharmaceutical companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our clinical studies and trials and our pre-clinical\nstudies;\n\u2022\nstatus of regulatory requirements for approval of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity regarding the pricing of Firdapse\u00ae\n;\n\u2022\nannouncements of product development successes and failures by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew products introduced or announced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the abilities of our third-party manufacturers to provide drug or product in a timely manner or to meet FDA requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in reimbursement levels;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactual or unanticipated variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nexpiration or termination of licenses (particularly our License Agreement for Firdapse\u00ae\n), research contracts, or other collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the regulatory climate and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in pharmaceutical company regulations or reimbursements for pharmaceutical products as a result of healthcare reform or other legislation;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our common stock, particularly sales by our officers, directors and significant stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur.\nIn addition, equity markets in general, and the market for emerging pharmaceutical and life sciences companies in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies traded in those markets. Further, changes in economic conditions in the United States, Europe, or globally could impact our ability to grow profitably. Adverse economic changes are outside our control and may result in material adverse impacts on our business or financial results. These broad market and industry factors may materially affect the market price of our shares, regardless of our own development and operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Any such litigation that we become involved in could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws\ncontain provisions that could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws,\nand applicable provisions of Delaware corporate law, may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our Board of Directors and management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to amend our charter documents, including stockholder supermajority voting requirements;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nrequirements that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by the Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures our stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates for election to our Board of Directors or to place stockholders\u2019 proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of stockholders.\nOn September 20, 2011, the board of directors approved the adoption of a stockholder rights plan (\u201cRights Plan\u201d), which was amended on September 19, 2016 and further amended on August 28, 2019. The rights will expire on September 20, 2022, unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged.\nThe Rights Plan was implemented through our entry into a rights agreement with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights agent, and the declaration of a non-taxable\ndividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (each, a Right) for each outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend was paid on October 7, 2011 to holders of record as of that date. Each right is attached to and trades with the associated share of common stock. The rights will become exercisable only if a person acquires beneficial ownership of 17.5% or more of our common stock (or, in the case of a person who beneficially owned 17.5% or more of our common stock on the date the rights plan was adopted, such person acquires beneficial ownership of any additional shares of our common stock) or after the date of the Rights Agreement, commences a tender offer that, if consummated, would result in beneficial ownership by a person of 17.5% or more of our common stock.\nThe intent of the Rights Plan is to protect our stockholders\u2019 interests by encouraging anyone seeking control of our company to negotiate with our Board of Directors. However, our Rights Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders. This plan may discourage, delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including offers or attempts that could result in a premium over the market price of our common stock. This plan could reduce the price that stockholders might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future. Furthermore, the anti-takeover provisions of our Rights Plan may entrench management and make it more difficult to replace management even if the stockholders consider it beneficial to do so.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any person who owns 15% or more of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless Board or stockholder approval is obtained. These provisions could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, or for members of our Board of Directors to be replaced, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nAny delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of March 11, 2021, we had 103,824,973 shares of our common stock outstanding, of which 7,234,820 shares were held by our officers and directors. We also had outstanding: (i) stock options to purchase an aggregate of 13,888,670 shares at exercise prices ranging from $0.79 to $6.63 per share (8,625,621 of which are currently exercisable); and (ii) restricted stock units for 235,671 shares of common stock (none of which are currently vested). Sales of shares, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock or other securities, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors should not invest in our common stock if they require dividend income. Our stockholders will not realize a return on their investment unless the trading price of our common stock appreciates, which is uncertain and unpredictable.", "PERMNO": 91606, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CPRX"}
