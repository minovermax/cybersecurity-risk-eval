Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under \"Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.\nPrices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. Historically, the markets for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. For example, beginning in the second half of 2014 and continuing into 2015, the WTI and Brent crude oil benchmarks have substantially declined. In addition, the Henry Hub natural gas benchmark began to decline in late 2014 and continued its decline into 2015. Many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nworldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of OPEC to agree to and maintain production controls;\n\u2022\nthe level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022\nchanges in weather patterns and climate;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;\n\u2022\nthe effect of conservation efforts;\n\u2022\nepidemics or pandemics;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions worldwide.\nThe long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in commodity prices could have adverse effects on our business, including:\n\u2022\nreducing the amount of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil that we can produce economically;\n\u2022\nreducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\ncausing us to reduce our capital expenditures, or delay or postpone some of our capital projects, resulting in lower production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to impair the carrying value of our assets;\n\u2022\nreducing the amounts of our estimated proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves that we may produce economically;\n\u2022\nreducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt and/or increasing the costs of obtaining such capital.\nA substantial, extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices could adversely affect the abilities of our counterparties to perform their obligations to us, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, oil sands mining or liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas transportation, with partners and other counterparties in order to share risks associated with those operations. In addition, we market our products to a variety of purchasers. If commodity prices remain at or fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. The inability of our joint venture partners to fund their portion of the costs under our joint venture agreements, or the nonperformance by purchasers, contractors or other counterparties of their obligations to us, could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us.\nOffshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities.\nEstimates of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our reserves.\nThe proved reserve information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been derived from engineering estimates. Estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group. The synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants, a third-party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands. Reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, as well as other conditions in existence at those dates. For 2014, the average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period were WTI crude oil of $94.99 per bbl, Henry Hub natural gas of $4.31 per mmbtu and Brent crude oil of $101.39 per bbl. Any significant future price change could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. The January 2015 benchmark closing prices for the first day of the month were WTI crude oil of $52.69 per bbl, Henry Hub natural gas of $2.99 per mmbtu and Brent crude oil of $55.55 per bbl. To the extent that we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices in 2015, there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation, among other things.\nReserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured. (Bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil.) Estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nlocation, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation;\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas;\n\u2022\nvolumes of bitumen in-place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs; and\n\u2022\nindustry economic conditions, levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations.\nAs a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated:\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of production;\n\u2022\nthe revenues and costs associated with that production; and\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of future development expenditures.\nThe discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future cash flows from our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and costs applicable at the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower.\nIn addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nIf we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition.\nThe rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil are produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nobtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil in promising areas;\n\u2022\ndrilling success;\n\u2022\nthe ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget;\n\u2022\nthe ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to fund such activity.\nFuture exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs.\nDrilling for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blowouts or surface cratering;\n\u2022\nlack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods; and\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.\nIf we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nDelays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndenial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;\n\u2022\nunplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;\n\u2022\nincreased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nshortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022\nmarket-related increases in a project\u2019s debt or equity financing costs; and\n\u2022\nnonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.\nAny one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our capital projects.\nWe may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and/or changes in environmental, health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur businesses are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas, waste management, pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of endangered species as well as laws, regulations, and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security. We have incurred and may continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws, regulations, and other requirements. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws, regulations, and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site clean-ups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us.\nWe believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation in countries where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, and Norway, and the European Union. Internationally, member countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol have made additional commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. has not ratified the Kyoto protocol, but may do so in the future. The EPA has announced its intention to specifically regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Finalization of new legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. These costs and capital expenditures could be material. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities.\nThe potential adoption of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.\nHydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. For example, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. Further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. In addition to such legislative and regulatory proposals, there are also a number of studies and initiatives underway that may lead to additional proposals in the future, such as the EPA research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to\noperational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells.\nWorldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.\nLocal political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us. A total of 41 percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes related to continuing operations in 2014 was derived from production outside the U.S. and 55 percent of our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2014 were located outside the U.S. All of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in Canada. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities or other armed conflict attendant to doing business within or outside of the U.S. There are many risks associated with operations in countries such as E.G., Angola, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Libya, and in global markets including:\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas and taxation;\n\u2022\nother political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism, armed conflict and civil disturbances;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and\n\u2022\nfluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.\nFor the past several years, there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests, including demonstrations which have been marked by violence and numerous incidences of terrorist acts, within some countries in the Middle East, including Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. Some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest.\nIf such unrest continues to spread, conflicts could result in civil wars, regional conflicts, and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the U.S. These may have the following results, among others:\n\u2022\nvolatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products;\n\u2022\nnegative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted;\n\u2022\nsecurity concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel;\n\u2022\ndamage to, or the inability to access, production facilities or other operating assets; and\n\u2022\ninability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations.\nContinued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks, or other armed conflict, could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate.\nActions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability, both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future. Changes in law could also adversely affect our results, including new regulations resulting in higher costs to transport our production by pipeline, rail car, truck or vessel or the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of other countries.\nOur commodity price risk management may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.\nTo the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure.\nOur business, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. Such technologies are integrated into our business operations and used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the U.S. and abroad, including those systems used to transport production to market. Use of the internet and other public networks for communications, services, and storage, including \u201ccloud\u201d computing, exposes users (including our business) to cybersecurity risks. While our information systems and related infrastructure experienced attempted and actual minor breaches of our cybersecurity in the past, we have not suffered any losses or breaches which had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or breaches in the future. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information systems and related infrastructure security vulnerabilities.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, rail and other transportation capacity constraints.\nThe marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities, rail cars, trucks and vessels. If any pipelines, rail cars, trucks or vessels become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, which could increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production. Both the cost and availability of pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our crude oil could be adversely impacted by new and expected state or federal regulations relating to transportation of crude oil.\nIf we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe typically seek the acquisition of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves (as previously discussed), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and many competitors, including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do. We compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel, including petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other specialists, required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas to end-users. Such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources, which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment, leases and other properties. They may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel.\nMany of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners, which may decrease our ability to manage risk.\nWe often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations, such as oil and gas exploration and production, or oil sands mining, with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations. However, these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs, particularly where we are not the operator. We could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations. In addition, misconduct, fraud, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. We do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.\nOur North America E&P and International E&P operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, labor disputes and accidents. Our OSM operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or other interruptions. These same risks can be applied to the third-parties which transport our products from our facilities. A prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipelines, rail cars, trucks, or vessels to transport our production could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs.\nOur operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Various hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico region has increased.\nLitigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance.\nWe currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. The subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, privacy laws, antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. In some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants, and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances. If we are not able to successfully defend such claims, they may result in substantial liability. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations.\nIn connection with our separation from MPC, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that MPC agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from MPC will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that MPC will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from MPC any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.\nThe spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.\nWe obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections\n355 and 368 and related provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). If the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, then we will not be able to rely on the ruling. Furthermore, the IRS does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin-off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Rather, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling. In connection with the spin-off, we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel, substantially to the effect that, the distribution of shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off qualified as tax free to MPC, us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by MPC and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail.\nIf, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the spin-off were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, each U.S. holder of our common stock who received shares of MPC common stock in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of MPC common stock received. That distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin-off. For each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. We would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of MPC common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares.\nUnder the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with MPC in connection with the spin-off, MPC is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on MPC or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of actions taken, or breaches of representations and warranties made in the Tax Sharing Agreement, by MPC or any of its affiliates. However, if the spin-off and/or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates, we would be responsible for all such taxes.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over Marathon Oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Marathon Oil common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.", "PERMNO": 15069, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MRO"}
