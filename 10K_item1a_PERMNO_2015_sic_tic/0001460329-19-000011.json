{"cik": "1460329", "company": "Fluent, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this 2018 Form 10-K, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business is subject to a significant number of governmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses or reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions, and failure to comply with them could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation under the FTC Act, TCPA, Do Not Call Implementation Act, CAN-SPAM Act, TSR, the California Anti-Spam Act, COPPA, and other federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which generally are designed to prevent deceptive practices in advertising, online marketing and telemarketing; protect the privacy of the public; and prevent the misuse of personal information available in the marketplace are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We incur significant expenses in our attempt to ensure compliance with these laws and successfully defend ourselves in litigation.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which can be enforced by government entities or, in some cases, private parties, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Keeping or bringing our business in compliance with new laws may be costly and may adversely affect our revenue or results of operations. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and they may be interpreted and applied inconsistently across jurisdictions or with our current policies and practices. Parts of our business, which rely on third-party publishers to drive users to our sites, could be adversely impacted if we or any of our third-party publishers or clients violate applicable laws. In addition, new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our clients could affect the activities or strategies of such clients and, therefore, lead to reductions in their levels of business with us.\nThe following legal and regulatory developments could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations:\n\u2022\namendment, enactment or interpretation of laws and regulations that restrict the collection, access and use of personal information or reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions or the supply of data available;\n\u2022\nchanges in cultural and consumer attitudes in favor of further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions;\n\u2022\nour failure or the failure of our third-party publishers, service providers or clients to comply with laws or regulations, where mutual compliance is required;\n\u2022\nfailure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\nChanges in applicable legislation or regulations that restrict or dictate how we collect, maintain, combine and disseminate information could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the future, we may be subject to significant additional expenses to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to investigate, defend or remedy actual or alleged violations.\nWe supply data to call center clients for telemarketing campaigns and manage text messaging campaigns, both of which may subject us or our clients to claims under the TCPA. In recent years, the TCPA has become a fertile source for both individual and class action lawsuits and regulatory actions. We have expended considerable resources to comply with the TCPA and defend ourselves against legal claims, in addition to costs to insure against TCPA-related claims, though we have not experienced material losses from TCPA claims to this point. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes and procedures in response to and to defend against TCPA-related claims could result in legal and monetary liability, significant fines and penalties, or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with our third-party publishers\u2019 email campaigns to generate traffic for our websites, we are subject to various state and federal laws regulating commercial email communications, including the CAN-SPAM Act and the California Anti-Spam Act. If we or any of our third-party publishers fail to comply with any provisions of these laws or regulations, we could\nbe subject to regulatory investigation, enforcement actions, litigation or claims. Any negative outcomes from such regulatory actions or litigation or claims, including monetary penalties or damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to safeguard such data and user privacy could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and results of operations.\nThe user profiles in our database contain user information such as name, age, personal address, phone number and email address. Our ability to provide services using that information is critical, and a breach of the security measures on our systems or on those of our third-party vendors could result in the misappropriation of either our proprietary information or the personal information of users that we collect, or the interruption or breakdown of our operations. Although we have physical and cyber security controls and associated procedures, we cannot guarantee that our websites, database and information technology systems, and those of our third-party service providers, will be free of security breaches, computer malware or viruses, phishing impersonation attacks, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, ransomware and similar incidents or disruptions from unauthorized use of our database and systems. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by users, or any interruptions, delays or website shutdowns, could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of litigation and possible liability, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is largely dependent on consumer-facing websites, which could become inaccessible due to service interruptions or subject to hacking or computer attacks. If our or our third-party publishers' websites are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not return as often in the future, or at all. As we grow and obtain more visibility, we may become more vulnerable to these types of attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage networks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and may not be recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Because our websites, database and systems are critical to our success, if an actual or perceived breach were to occur or if our websites or systems were to otherwise cease to function properly, our operations could be adversely affected, our advertiser clients and users could lose confidence and trust in us, and we could lose revenue or proprietary information, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such threats or to remediate problems that could be caused by security breaches. Additionally, any server interruptions, breakdowns or system failures, including failures which may be attributable to events within our control, could increase our future operating costs and cause us to lose business. We maintain insurance policies covering losses relating to our network systems, business continuities or other cybersecurity liabilities. However, these policies may not cover the cost of any claims. Any disruptions in our systems, whether caused by hacking or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our future results.\nIn the event of unauthorized access or cyber-attacks, the integrity of our data may be affected. Security and privacy concerns, any actual or perceived unauthorized release of user information or any of the other issues described above could adversely affect our ability to maintain engagement of existing users or attract new users, cause users to resist providing the personal information necessary to our business, cause existing advertiser clients to cease doing business with us or subject us to governmental or third-party lawsuits, investigations, regulatory fines or other actions or liability, thereby harming our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and the handling of personal information are complex and evolving. While we strive to comply with all legal and contractual obligations regarding these matters, any failure or perceived failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we store, process and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contractual requirements, regarding privacy, data protection and the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of personal information. These laws and regulations involve matters central to our business, including user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, electronic contracts and other communications, e-commerce, sweepstakes, rewards and other promotional marketing campaigns, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, libel, defamation, internet or data usage, and online payment services. Both in the United States and abroad, these laws and regulations continuously evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent across jurisdictions and may conflict with other rules or our practices, or that new regulations could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could seriously harm our business. Moreover, if third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations also may put user information at risk and could, in turn, harm our reputation, business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, compliance with privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to new constraints on our business, the development of new processes, the effects of potential non-compliance by us or third-party service providers, and enforcement actions.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our data collection practices and any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information, whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse, or error, could harm our reputation, impair our ability to attract website visitors or to attract and retain clients, result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by users, and thereby harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we could incur significant costs which our insurance policies may not cover and could cause us to expend significant resources in protecting against security breaches and complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign regulations regarding data privacy and data breach notification obligations.\nThe GDPR adopted by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), which took effect on May 25, 2018, as well as other regulatory and legal developments, are imposing new requirements and restrictions on entities involved in the collection, use and storage of personal information. These changes could increase our costs or impact our ability to collect personal information and generate revenue therefrom.\nThe GDPR imposes new requirements on entities and grants individuals new rights in connection with the collection, use and storage of the personal information of EU residents. Many of these new requirements are more restrictive than those under existing U.S. law, and the individual rights granted by the GDPR are more expansive than the rights typically granted to U.S. residents. For example, under the GDPR, an EU resident must affirmatively opt-in to receive email marketing (unless there is another basis to send the individual email marketing, as expressly permitted under the GDPR), while U.S. residents can be sent commercial email unless and until they opt-out. The GDPR also grants EU residents the rights: (a) to be forgotten, which entails the right to have their personal data removed from an entity\u2019s database (as well as the databases of all third parties that received the personal data from that entity); (b) to modify their collected personal data; (c) to restrict use of their collected personal data; and (d) to \u201cdata portability,\u201d which entails the right to request that personal data collected be provided to the individual in a machine-readable, usable format.\nOur websites that are available to UK residents are subject to the GDPR for as long as the UK remains an EU member state, and it is likely that these websites will be subject to data protection laws substantially similar to the GDPR following any exit by the UK from the EU (\u201cSuccessor Legislation\u201d). Our websites available to UK residents have been designed, and are operated, in compliance with the GDPR. The fines for failing to comply with the GDPR are significant and the potential ways that the GDPR, or any Successor Legislation, could be applied to a business such as ours are uncertain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these websites in compliance with the GDPR or any Successor Legislation. Additionally, if we expand into additional international markets, we may be subject to additional data protection laws.\nIn addition, some of our advertiser clients have required that the personal information we deliver to them be collected and maintained in compliance with the GDPR for our U.S. operations. While we do not believe that the GDPR applies to our U.S. operations, if we are contractually required to comply with the GDPR in the U.S., that could increase our costs and expenses associated with providing advertising services.\nWe expect the trend towards enhanced regulation and personal rights applicable to the collection, use, storage and sharing of personal information to continue. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which establishes requirements for businesses and grants individual rights similar to those contained in the GDPR. The CCPA, which takes effect in 2020, includes a right to be forgotten, a right for individuals to object to having their data shared with third parties and a right to be informed of what data is being shared. While significantly less restrictive than the GDPR, the\nCCPA will, nevertheless, require changes to our operations which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outcome of litigation, inquiries, investigations, examinations or other legal proceedings in which we are involved, in which we may become involved, or in which our clients or competitors are involved could distract management, increase our expenses or subject us to significant monetary damages or restrictions on our ability to do business.\nAlthough we are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, legal proceedings arise frequently in the normal course of our business. These may include individual consumer cases, class action lawsuits and inquiries, investigations, examinations, regulatory proceedings or other actions brought by federal (e.g., the FTC) or state (e.g., state attorneys general) authorities. Regardless of whether any claims in which we are involved have merit, or whether we are ultimately held liable or subject to payment of damages, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management\u2019s time away from our operations.\nThe scope and outcome of these proceedings is often difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in lawsuits may seek recovery of large amounts, and the cost to defend such litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity and uncertainty associated with investigations, litigation and orders (whether pertaining to us, our clients or our competitors) that could diminish consumers' view of our services and/or result in material discovery expenses. In addition, a court-ordered injunction or an administrative cease-and-desist order or settlement may require us to modify our business practices or prohibit conduct that would otherwise be legal and in which our competitors may engage. Many of the complex and technical statutes to which we are subject, including state and federal financial privacy requirements, may provide for civil and criminal penalties and may permit consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits against us and obtain statutorily prescribed damages. Additionally, our clients might face similar proceedings, actions or inquiries which could affect their businesses and, in turn, our ability to do business with those clients.\nWhile we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened legal proceeding, investigation, examination or supervisory activity will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, such events are inherently uncertain and adverse outcomes could result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key personnel, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including Ryan Schulke, our Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Conlin, our President, and other key employees in all areas of our organization, each of whom is important to the management of certain aspects of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction, and each of whom may be difficult to replace. We carry \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policies on Mr. Schulke and Mr. Conlin in the amounts of $10.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, the beneficiary of which is HIG Whitehorse, the holder of our $70.0 million term loans pursuant to the Credit Agreement dated December 8, 2015, (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The loss of the services of these key individuals and the process to replace these individuals could involve significant time and expense and could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nAdditionally, given the number of employees we have relative to our revenue, we rely heavily upon certain key employees to support different operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained.\nWe also believe that, as our business continues to grow, our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial, technical and operational personnel. Competition for such personnel is considerable, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel.\nWe attract a substantial majority of visitors to our websites through media purchases from third-party publishers, internet search providers and social media platforms. There is substantial competition for this web traffic, and any decline in the supply of media available through these third parties or increase in the price of this media could increase the cost to attract visitors to our websites and reduce our profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract users to our websites and generate revenues from their activities thereon in a cost-effective manner. A substantial majority of our revenue is attributable to visitor traffic originating from third-party publishers, including ad networks, social media platforms and search engines. Our ability to maintain the number of users who come to our and our third-party publishers\u2019 websites is not entirely within our control. Third-party publishers can change the media inventory they make available to us at any time and/or place significant restrictions on our content offerings. Many of these publishers have their own guidelines on acceptable content, advertisements and the types of advertisers and websites that can advertise on their properties. These guidelines change frequently and can often be unpublished. If a third-party publisher\ndecides not to make media inventory available to us, decides to demand higher pricing or a higher revenue share, or places significant restrictions on the use of such inventory, we may not be able to find media inventory from other websites that satisfy our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nMoreover, there is substantial competition for web traffic among both established media buyers and smaller operators, and we expect this competition to continue to increase, given the limited barriers to entry into the market. Additionally, if we expand the scope of our services, we may compete with a greater number of websites, clients and traditional media companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. Major internet search engine operators, such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft, as well as social media platforms such as Facebook, have significant numbers of direct sales personnel and substantial proprietary advertising inventory and web traffic that provide them significant competitive advantages. Past and possible future consolidation of online advertising networks has led to and could lead to further concentration of desirable inventory on websites or networks owned by a small number of persons or entities, which could affect pricing and availability of media inventory and web traffic available to us. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors enjoy other competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, larger client bases, greater access to media inventory on high-traffic websites, and greater financial, technical and marketing resources. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these competitors in order to acquire media inventory that meets our performance, price and quality requirements. If we are not able to do so, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be harmed if we or our third-party publishers are unable to contact users through specific channels.\nWe and our third-party publishers use email, text messages, push notifications and telephone calls, among other channels, to reach users for marketing purposes. The laws and regulations governing such usage continue to evolve, and changes in technology, the marketplace, or consumer preferences may lead to the adoption of additional laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations. If new laws or regulations are adopted, or existing laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, to impose additional restrictions on our ability to send email, text messages or push notifications to users, or engage in telemarketing, we may not be able to communicate with users in a cost-effective manner.\nAdditionally, if email providers or internet service providers (\"ISPs\") implement new or more restrictive email or content delivery or accessibility policies, including with respect to net neutrality, it may become more difficult to deliver emails to consumers or for consumers to access our websites and services. For example, certain email providers, including Google, may categorize our emails as \u201cpromotional,\u201d and these emails may be directed to an alternate, and less readily accessible, section of a consumer\u2019s inbox. If email providers materially limit or halt the delivery of emails advertising our websites, or if we fail to deliver emails to users in a manner compatible with email providers\u2019 handling or authentication technologies, our ability to contact users through email could be significantly restricted. In addition, if we are placed on \u201cspam\u201d lists or lists of entities that have been involved in sending unwanted, unsolicited emails, our operating results and financial condition could be substantially harmed. Further, if ISPs prioritize or provide superior access to our competitors\u2019 content, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, telephone carriers may block or put consumer warnings on calls originating from call centers. Consumers increasingly screen their incoming emails and telephone calls, including by using such tools and warnings, and therefore it is possible that users may not reliably receive our emails or telephone messages. If we are unable to contact users effectively by email or telephone as a result of legislation, blockage, screening technologies or otherwise, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nAdditionally, as we expand our usage of text messaging and push notifications to contact users, we become more dependent on third-party providers that control the dissemination and deliverability of such communications. These third parties may include mobile operating systems, internet service providers, wireless carriers and internet browsers, each of which may have its own guidelines on acceptable content. These guidelines are subject to change, which could restrict our ability to re-engage mobile users, leading our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nThird-party publishers or vendors may engage in unauthorized or unlawful acts that could subject us to significant liability or cause us to lose clients.\nWe generate a significant portion of our web visitors from online media that we purchase from third-party publishers. While we actively monitor our publishers\u2019 activities, we cannot police all such behavior. Any activity by third-party publishers that clients view as potentially damaging to their brands, whether or not permitted by our contracts with our clients, could harm our relationships with such clients, in which instance they may refuse to pay or terminate their relationships with us, resulting in a loss of revenue. In addition, we may also face liability for any failure of our third-party publishers or vendors to comply with\nregulatory requirements. Users or clients may complain about the content of publisher ads or the methods by which ads are delivered by third-party publishers, which may expose us to lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny. Despite our efforts to monitor and deter unauthorized or unlawful actions by these third-party publishers, and to contractually limit our liability in such instances, it is possible that we could be held responsible for this behavior. As a result, we could be subject to costly litigation and, if we are unsuccessful in defending, could incur damages for the unauthorized or unlawful acts of third-party publishers or vendors.\nLimitations on our or our third-party publishers\u2019 ability to collect and use data derived from user activities, as well as new technologies that block our or our third-party publishers\u2019 ability to deliver internet-based advertising, could significantly diminish the value of our services and have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue.\nWhen a user visits our websites, we use technologies to collect information and use registration data provided by users and user responses to our dynamically populated survey questions to create robust user profiles, which we use in our targeted ad serving and consumer data offerings. The use of personal information is the subject of litigation, regulatory scrutiny and industry self-regulatory activities, including the discussion of \u201cdo-not-track\u201d technologies and guidelines.\nTechnologies, tools, software and applications (including new and enhanced web browsers) have been developed, and are likely to continue to be developed, that can block or allow users to opt out of display, search and internet-based advertising and content, or shift the location where advertising appears on pages so that our advertisements are presented in less favorable locations or are obscured. Certain of these technologies only allow ads that are deemed \u201cacceptable,\u201d which could be defined in ways that place us at a disadvantage. Recently, app developers have developed ad blocking apps for smartphones and other mobile devices which may hinder marketing activities to smartphone users. As a result, the adoption of such technologies, tools, software, and applications could reduce the number of display and search advertisements that we or our third-party publishers are able to deliver and this, in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nInterruptions, failures or defects in our data collection systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory changes or enforcement actions affecting our ability to collect user data, could also limit our ability to analyze data from, and thereby optimize, our clients\u2019 marketing campaigns. If our access to data is limited in the future, we may be unable to provide effective services to clients and may lose clients and revenue.\nAn increasing number of people are accessing the internet primarily from their mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets and other devices. Our ability to remain competitive with the shift to mobile devices, including the increasing prevalence of mobile apps, is critical to maintaining our revenue and profitability.\nMobile devices are increasingly becoming the primary means by which people access the internet. While we design and build our websites with a \u201cmobile first\u201d approach, we will need to ensure our websites continue to attract and engage users as they continue to shift their online interactions from desktop computers to smartphones, tablets and other next-generation platforms and devices. Mobile users have a more finite experience with our websites than desktop or laptop users, and there is a greater chance of interruption, which means we have a shorter timeframe in which to engage them. Additionally, the functionality and user experience associated with some mobile devices, as a result of smaller screen sizes, may make the use of our websites through such devices more difficult than through a desktop or laptop computer. Moreover, users are increasingly accustomed to using mobile applications, rather than internet browsers, to access information online. At this time, mobile applications are not a primary driver of our business, which could place us at a disadvantage in the marketplace. If we fail to effectively engage these users, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if our technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of confidence, data security breaches or lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and products are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in optimizing our websites for these alternative devices, and we may need to devote significant resources to the development, support and maintenance of such websites. If we experience difficulties optimizing our websites, including problems with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems (e.g., Apple or Google) or social media platforms such as Facebook, our growth and consumer acquisition capabilities may be impaired. If we fail to maintain the monetization of the mobile versions of our websites effectively, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon third-party service providers in our operations.\nWe utilize numerous third-party service providers in our operations, and a failure by a third-party service provider could expose us to an inability to operate our websites, connect our advertiser clients with users and provide online marketing and advertising services. As with all software and web applications and systems, there may be, from time to time, technical malfunctions that arise with some of these third-party providers. It is possible that to remedy any such situation would require\nsubstantial time, resources and technical knowledge that we may not have or be able to acquire in a timely fashion. Additionally, some of these third-party service providers may face financial instability, which could lead to extended periods in which their platforms or applications are unavailable or fail to accurately track or account for online activity. If any of these platforms or applications goes down for an extended period of time, it is possible that we may lose clients and/or incur significant costs to either internalize some of these services or find suitable alternatives.\nOur operations have grown significantly over the past several years, which may make it difficult to effectively manage any future growth and scale our products quickly enough to meet our clients\u2019 needs while maintaining profitability.\nWe have historically experienced growth in our operations. This growth has placed, and any future growth will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Growth, if any, may make it more difficult for us to accomplish the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully scale our technology to accommodate a larger business and integrate acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmaintain our standing with key vendors, including third-party publishers and media platforms;\n\u2022\nmaintain our client service standards;\n\u2022\ndevelop and improve our operational, financial and management controls and maintain adequate reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022\nhire, train and manage additional staff needed to manage future growth.\nOur future success depends in part on the efficient performance of our ad serving and lead generation systems and technology infrastructure. As the number of websites and internet users and the amount of data collected increases, our technology infrastructure may not be able to meet the increased demand. Unexpected constraints on our technology infrastructure could lead to slower website response times or system failures and adversely affect the availability of websites and the level of user responses received, which could result in the loss of clients or revenue or have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nIn addition, our systems, procedures, processes and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations. The improvements required to manage growth may require us to make significant expenditures and reallocate valuable management resources. We may take on substantial costs to secure hosting and other technical services and data storage, upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our owned-and-operated websites, and deploy new products and services. This expansion could be expensive and complex and could result in inefficiencies or operational failures. If we do not implement this expansion successfully, or if we experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures during our implementation, the quality of our products and services and our users\u2019 experiences could decline. This could damage our reputation and cause us to lose current and potential users and clients. The costs associated with these adjustments to our infrastructure could harm our operating results. Accordingly, if we fail to effectively manage growth, our operating performance may suffer, and we may lose clients, key vendors and key personnel.\nWe also will likely need to continue to expand our workforce to meet the growing needs of our business. We operate in a specialized niche of the digital marketing and data marketplace, and there is a limited pool of experienced, qualified candidates. We may not be able to hire experienced qualified candidates if they are subject to non-competition restrictions imposed by prior employers. Finding and training suitable candidates can prove challenging, as the skills required to effectively and efficiently use our proprietary systems are not necessarily transferable from other businesses. If we are unable to effectively hire, train and manage a sufficient number of new employees, we may not be able to capitalize on opportunities and/or may not be able to continue to grow our business at past levels.\nHistorically, our quarterly and annual results of operations have rapidly improved due to several favorable factors, some of which are beyond our control. As we continue to grow, we may not be able to increase our market share and/or sustain our recent growth. Our inability to sustain our growth could cause our performance and outlook to be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors.\nAs we continue to grow our business, we may acquire additional businesses or personnel, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, disrupt our operations or otherwise subject us to risks inherent in identifying, acquiring and operating newly-acquired business units.\nAs we continue to grow our business, we may, in the future, determine to do so through the acquisition of additional business units and personnel that we believe could complement or expand our current business or offer growth opportunities. We may experience difficulties in identifying potential acquisition candidates that complement our current business at appropriate\nprices, or at all. We cannot assure you that our acquisition strategy will be successful. We may spend significant management time and resources in analyzing and negotiating acquisitions or investments that are not consummated. Furthermore, the ongoing process of integrating an acquired business unit or personnel is distracting, time-consuming, expensive and requires continuous optimization and allocation of resources, which could disrupt our operations. Additionally, if we use stock as consideration for an acquisition, this would dilute our existing shareholders, and if we use cash, this would reduce our liquidity and impact our financial flexibility. We may seek debt financing for particular acquisitions, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot overcome these and other challenges associated with a business acquisition strategy, we may not consummate or realize tangible benefits from any future acquisitions, which could impair our overall business results.\nWe operate in an industry that is rapidly evolving, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from digital marketing services, which is an industry that has undergone rapid and significant changes in its relatively short history, and which is characterized by rapidly-changing internet media and advertising technology, evolving industry standards, regulatory uncertainty, and changing user and client demands. Our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to the rapidly changing needs of our clients, as well as competitive technological developments and industry changes by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis. As a result of this continual evolution, we face risks and uncertainties such as:\n\u2022\nthe rapidly evolving industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic condition, market dynamics, regulatory enforcement or legislative environment affecting our, our third-party publishers\u2019, and our clients\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022\nour dependence on the availability and affordability of quality media from third-party publishers;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage cybersecurity risks and costs associated with maintaining a robust security infrastructure;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and expand existing client relationships;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new services, enhancements and features to meet new demands from our clients; and\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with and avoid regulatory scrutiny in a rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment.\nIf we are unable to address these risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to enhance and adapt our products and services to address the evolving needs of our clients and keep pace with rapidly changing technologies.\nThe digital media and marketing industry is characterized by rapidly changing standards and technologies, frequent new product and service introductions, and changing user and client demands. As our clients\u2019 needs evolve, we will need to continue to enhance our services and solutions to address these needs in order to maintain these relationships. We have invested in developing new products, markets, services and technologies and plan to expand our work force to meet the needs of our clients and continue our revenue growth. However, based on our experience, new websites, products and services may be less predictable and have lower margins than more established websites, products and services. Further, we may not be able to develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or at all. The time, expense and effort associated with developing and offering new and enhanced products and services may be greater than anticipated. If we are unsuccessful in enhancing our websites, products and services, we may fail to maintain our profitability, attract new clients or grow our revenue. Moreover, if we are unable to develop and bring to market additional products and services, and enhancements thereto, in a timely manner, or at all, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to offer such new products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the introduction of new technologies and services, including voice assistance, artificial intelligence, internet-of-things and machine learning, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices related to these technological developments could render our existing technologies and services obsolete and unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in technology. In particular, as we continue to transition to cloud-based technology, we may face new and additional costs to operate our business.\nWhile we continually make enhancements and other modifications to our proprietary technologies, such changes may contain design or performance defects that are not readily apparent. If our proprietary technologies fail to achieve their intended purpose or are less effective than technologies used by our competitors, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully adapt to our clients\u2019 needs and the rapidly changing digital media formats and other technologies. If we fail to adapt successfully, it could damage our reputation and our relationships with our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nUnfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry may damage our reputation, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith the growth of online advertising and e-commerce, there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public, privacy advocates, mainstream media, governmental bodies and others regarding online marketing, advertising and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests. Certain other companies within our industry may engage in activities that others may view as unlawful or inappropriate. These activities by third parties, including our competitors, or even other data-focused industries, may be seen as indicative of participants in our industry and may therefore harm the reputation of all participants in our industry, including us. Moreover, any such unfavorable publicity or negative public perception could lead to digital publishers and platforms such as Facebook and Google changing their business practices or additional regulatory scrutiny or lawmaking, which could adversely affect us or our industry. Heightened scrutiny on the part of the public or regulators may lead to general distrust of our industry, consumer reluctance to share and permit use of personal data and increased consumer opt-out rates, any of which could negatively influence, change or reduce our current and prospective clients\u2019 demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on attracting a large number of visitors to our websites and providing inquiries, clicks, calls, application installations and customers to our clients, which depends in part on our reputation within the industry, with our clients and with users. Our ability to attract potential users and, thereby, clients, also depends in part on users receiving incentives, job listings, prizes, samples and other content, as well as attractive offers from our clients. If our users are not satisfied with the content of our websites, the incentives or opportunities offered or our clients\u2019 offerings, our reputation and therefore our ability to attract additional clients and users could be harmed.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may be subject to investigations, inquiries or litigation by various regulators, which may harm our reputation, regardless of the outcome of any such action. Any damage to our reputation, including from publicity from legal proceedings against us or companies that work within our industry, governmental proceedings, class action litigation, or the disclosure of information security breaches or private information misuse, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to compete effectively against other digital marketing and advertising companies or fail to meet performance metrics required by our clients, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nThe market for digital marketing is intensely competitive, and we expect this competition to continue and to increase in the future, both from existing and new competitors. We compete for advertiser clients against other digital marketing companies on the basis of a number of factors, including return on investment of client\u2019s marketing spending, price and client service. We compete for a share of our advertiser clients\u2019 overall marketing budgets with online and traditional media companies, including:\n\u2022\ntraditional and digital advertising agencies;\n\u2022\nmajor internet portals and search engine companies with advertising networks;\n\u2022\nother digital marketing service providers, including online affiliate advertising networks and industry-specific portals or email marketing companies;\n\u2022\nthird-party publishers with their own sales forces that sell their online marketing services directly to clients;\n\u2022\nin-house marketing groups within current or potential clients;\n\u2022\noffline direct marketing agencies;\n\u2022\nmobile and social media; and\n\u2022\ntelevision, radio, print and other traditional media format companies.\nWhen our clients experience a reduction in their advertising budgets, newer media sources such as those we offer can often be the first expenditures to be cut. Our advertiser clients have expectations as to the quality and conversion rates of the leads that we generate and choose to do business with us based on the quality and convertibility of the leads we generate. The expectations of these clients may change over time, and the leads that we supply to our clients may not always meet these expectations. Conversion rates for leads can be impacted by factors other than the lead quality, many of which are outside our control. Such factors include the competition in our clients\u2019 industries and the sales practices of our clients. Lower conversion rates could be even more likely as we expand our services and relationships with our clients by moving our conversion point\nfurther \u201cdown the funnel,\u201d closer to where our clients are able to monetize the leads we provide. Our clients may curtail their advertising spend with us or stop using our services altogether if we fail to meet their expectations in terms of quality and convertibility of leads or otherwise fail to compete effectively against other online marketing and advertising companies.\nOur top ten advertisers account for 27% of our revenue, and the loss of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur clients\u2019 needs may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and such fluctuations could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nBecause the majority of our contracts with our advertiser clients do not have fixed commitments, these clients have the ability to unilaterally terminate their agreements with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time, with little or no prior notice. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements with any of our clients on acceptable terms, or at all.\nMoreover, while our websites receive an average of over 900,000 first-party user registrations daily, some of our advertiser clients seek specific sub-sets of these users and, despite the return they are able to achieve on the leads we provide, determine not to renew their agreements with us because we are unable to provide significant additional user profiles that meet their criteria.\nAdditionally, because of the nature of our performance-based agreements, we typically bear the costs of purchasing media without the guarantee of advertising spend by any particular advertiser client. In these contractual relationships, our advertiser clients pay us on a performance basis, whereby our right to receive payment is triggered when a user takes a particular action, such as signing up for an offer, downloading an app, or clicking on an ad and registering on an advertiser\u2019s site. We buy media largely when a user lands on one of our sites or on a per-registration basis, and we must be able to generate more revenue from our users than our cost to acquire such users in order to be profitable. Our ability to do so is dependent on many factors, including having the right media sources to drive engaged users to our sites, providing content and experiences that engage users and displaying relevant advertisements and other content to users. Other factors, some of which are outside of our control, such as competition, changing consumer tastes and general economic conditions, may inhibit our ability to operate our business profitably, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results are also subject to fluctuation as a result of seasonality and cyclicality in our and our clients\u2019 businesses. For example, our fourth fiscal quarter ending December 31 is typically characterized by higher advertiser budgets, which can be somewhat offset by seasonal challenges of lower availability and/or higher pricing for some forms of media during the holiday period. Further, as reflected in data from the IAB, industry spending on internet advertising has generally declined sequentially in the first quarter of the calendar year from the fourth quarter. Similar to the industry overall, some of our clients have lower advertising budgets during our first fiscal quarter ending March 31; however, we believe that the breadth of industries in which our clients operate provides us with some insulation from these fluctuations.\nIn addition to variations in budgets from quarter to quarter, certain clients have budgets that start stronger at the beginning of quarterly or monthly periods, may reach limits during such periods and then may have needs to satisfy their performance objectives at the end of such periods. Beyond these budgetary constraints and buying patterns of clients, other factors affecting our business may include the macroeconomic conditions affecting the digital media industry and the various market verticals we serve. Poor macroeconomic conditions could decrease our clients\u2019 advertising spending and, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from and occasionally have payment disputes with our clients, and we may not be able to collect on amounts owed to us.\nMany of our clients are thinly capitalized and pose credit risks, and we may have difficulty collecting on amounts owed to us. Some of our clients may challenge the determination of amounts we believe they owe or may refuse to pay because of performance-related claims. In these circumstances, we may have difficulty collecting on amounts we believe are owed.\nA portion of our client business is sourced through advertising agencies. In many cases, agencies are not required to pay us unless and until they are paid by the underlying client. In addition, many agencies are thinly capitalized and have or may develop high-risk credit profiles. If an agency became insolvent, or if an underlying client does not pay the agency, we may be required to write off accounts receivable as bad debt.\nWe could lose clients if we fail to detect click-through or other fraud on advertisements in a manner that is acceptable to our clients.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks or actions on our websites or our third-party publishers\u2019 websites, which could lead our clients to become dissatisfied with our campaigns and, in turn, lead to a loss of clients and related revenue. Click-through fraud occurs when automated systems (sometimes called \"bots\") are used to create an individual click on an ad displayed on a website, with the intent of generating a revenue share payment to the publisher, rather than an individual user actually viewing the underlying content. Action fraud occurs when online lead forms are completed with false or fictitious information in an effort to increase a publisher\u2019s compensable actions. From time to time, we have experienced fraudulent clicks or actions, and the risk of fraud may increase as bots become more sophisticated and difficult to detect. We do not charge our clients for fraudulent clicks or actions when they are detected, and such fraudulent activities could negatively affect our profitability or harm our reputation. If fraudulent clicks or actions are not detected, the affected clients may experience a reduced return on their investment in our marketing programs, which could lead the clients to become dissatisfied with our campaigns, and in turn, lead to loss of clients and related revenue. Additionally, we have terminated and may, in the future, terminate our relationships with publishers who we believe to have engaged in fraud. Termination of such relationships entails a loss of revenue associated with the legitimate actions or clicks generated by such publishers.\nAs a creator and a distributor of digital media content, we face potential liability and expenses for legal claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we create or distribute, including materials provided by third parties. If we are required to pay damages or expenses in connection with these legal claims, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe display original content and third-party content on our websites and in our marketing messages. As a result, we face potential liability based on a variety of theories, including deceptive advertising and copyright or trademark infringement. We believe that our use of any third-party brand names or marks falls within the \u201cfair use\u201d exception, but these third parties may disagree, and the laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. We are also exposed to risk that content provided by third parties is inaccurate or misleading, and for material posted to our websites by users and other third parties. These claims could divert management time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to investigate and defend, regardless of the merit of these claims. Although we maintain general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type, or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance, or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and advertiser clients may be subject to sales and use tax and other taxes.\nThe application of sales and use tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax on our digital marketing/advertising services is complex and evolving. In general, sales of tangible personal property are subject to sales and use tax unless a specific exemption applies, while services are generally excluded from sales tax unless specifically subject to such tax. Advertising services are considered a service and are generally not subject to sales and use tax, except in a few states. Some states, including New York, impose a sales tax on \u201cinformation services.\u201d In New York, the sales tax explicitly excludes \u201cadvertising\u201d services from sales and use tax; however, the line between excluded advertising services and taxable information services may, in practice, be unclear. Further complicating the determination of the sales taxability of services is the need to determine where the taxable sale occurs (i.e., on the origin of the service or at the destination where the service is consumed). Either or both of the origin jurisdiction\u2019s or the destination jurisdiction\u2019s laws may apply to a single transaction that spans two or more states.\nIn addition, many state governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues to offset sales tax revenues lost from online sales of merchandise where online merchants with no physical presence in a state have, in general, not been required to collect and remit sales taxes. Some jurisdictions have implemented laws that require remote sellers of goods and services to collect and remit sales taxes on sales to customers within the jurisdiction based on economic nexus (i.e., where the business exceeds a dollar volume or number of transactions in the jurisdiction), even when the seller has no physical presence within the jurisdiction. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al, overturned prior law which required physical presence for nexus and endorsed economic nexus as a basis for South Dakota to require online merchants to collect and remit sales taxes, even when the online merchant has no physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state.\nApproximately half of the states have adopted economic nexus as a basis to require online merchants to collect sales tax. Most of such laws apply prospectively or have delayed effective dates. More states may be expected to follow suit. The impact of the Wayfair decision on our business is uncertain. In states that adopt economic nexus and also tax specified enumerated services, if our services are found to be subject to that state\u2019s sales tax on services, we may have to collect and remit sales tax,\nwhich adds complexity and compliance costs and, due to the increased overall cost of our service, could make our service offerings less attractive and adversely affect our business.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position and business may suffer.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our proprietary systems and technology. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law, confidentiality agreements, and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisers, client vendors and publishers. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or unauthorized parties from copying aspects of our services or obtaining and using our proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosures or uses, and we cannot assure you that our rights under such agreements will be enforceable. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights can be difficult and costly. Litigation, while it may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could adversely affect our business, even if we are successful on the merits. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties.\nCovenants in our Credit Agreement impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of significant restrictions and affirmative and negative covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including dividends, distributions, stock repurchases or redemptions;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase specified indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements containing certain prohibitions affecting us or our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, which require us to maintain minimum EBITDA levels, total leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Agreement also requires us to make scheduled mandatory principal repayments and requires that a portion of our \u201cExcess Cash Flow,\u201d as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, be applied to prepay amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement. These mandatory prepayments may reduce the amount of cash available to us to fund the growth of our business.\nThe Credit Agreement also includes significant penalties for prepayments other than the mandatory prepayments discussed above. The amount of these prepayment penalties is reduced annually over a three-year period. If we borrow additional amounts under the Credit Agreement, this three-year period restarts on the newly borrowed amounts. These prepayment penalties make it less attractive for us to make additional borrowings under the Credit Agreement and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt on terms that would be acceptable to us.\nThese covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand and pursue our business strategies and otherwise conduct our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to comply with such covenants. These restrictions also limit our ability to obtain future financings or to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nA breach of any covenant in the Credit Agreement or the agreements governing any other indebtedness that we may have outstanding from time to time would result in a default under that agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in an acceleration of the debt outstanding under the agreement and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the debt outstanding under other debt agreements. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such debt. Even if new financing were available at such time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or terms as favorable as our current agreements. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may require additional capital in the future in order to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our growth and may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Disruptions in the global equity and credit markets may limit our ability to access capital.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders would experience dilution, which may be significant and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Any debt financing, if available, may restrict our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue certain operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" and avail ourselves of certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company,\" as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"smaller reporting companies,\" including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer a \"smaller reporting company.\" We will remain a \"smaller reporting company\" until the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $250 million or more and annual revenue as of our most recently completed fiscal year is $100 million or more, or the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $700 million or more, regardless of annual revenue.\nOur management and independent auditors have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls in future periods, which may lead to errors or omissions in our financial statements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations require that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. Maintaining and adapting our internal controls is expensive and requires significant management attention. Moreover, as we continue to grow, our internal controls may become more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amid dynamic regulatory and other guidance.\nAs described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this 2018 Form 10-K, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018 and that we had, as of such date, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to internal control deficiencies over the revenue recognition process; specifically, the aggregation of control deficiencies related to inadequate segregation of duties, significant deficiencies within the Company\u2019s information technology general controls, and ineffective manual preventative and detective controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This material weakness identified in Item 9A did not result in any adjustments or restatements of our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements or disclosures for any prior period previously reported by the Company. However, until the material weakness is remediated and our associated disclosure controls and procedures\nimproved, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting occur in the future, our future consolidated financial statements or other information filed with the SEC may contain material misstatements.\nWe are evaluating and developing a plan, which will include the implementation of appropriate processes and controls to remediate the material weakness described above. While we work towards the design and implementation of these processes and controls, we may rely significantly on manual procedures to assist us with meeting the objectives otherwise fulfilled by an effective control environment. The implementation of new procedures and controls could be costly and distract management from other activities. Prior to the complete remediation of this material weakness, there remains a risk that the transitional controls on which we currently rely will fail to be sufficiently effective, which could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements. If the new controls being implemented to address the material weakness and to strengthen the overall internal control are not designed or do not operate effectively, if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following these new processes or if we are otherwise unable to remediate this material weakness, it may result in untimely or inaccurate reporting of our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, although we review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any such additional weakness or failure to remediate the existing weakness could materially adversely affect our financial condition or ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements, which could result in violations of applicable securities laws and NASDAQ listing requirements, subject us to litigation and investigations, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements, and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets.\nRisks Related to the Spin-off\nFollowing the Spin-off, we face additional costs associated with being a standalone public company.\nPrior to the Spin-off on March 26, 2018, Fluent and Red Violet shared certain elements of the corporate reporting structure, including many of the corporate governance and financial reporting functions. Because Fluent is now an independent company with a different management team, the corporate functions are no longer conducted or overseen at a separate corporate level. As a relatively new standalone public company, Fluent is continuing to develop its own policies, systems, processes and operations. Although many components of operating as a standalone public company are well established, there are a number of business and organizational changes that have been made and will need to be made in order to complete our transition to a new standalone public company.\nAdditionally, as a standalone public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to implement specific corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements under Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as the rules of NASDAQ. The Exchange Act requires us to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Sarbanes-Oxley requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these requirements places additional demands on our legal, accounting, finance and investor relations staff and on our accounting, financial and information systems. We also may have additional legal and accounting compliance costs, including additional compensation expenses, as we may be required to hire additional legal, accounting, tax, finance and investor relations staff. These additional efforts may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPrior to the Spin-off, the Company had a history of losses and negative cash flow from operations, and we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a stand-alone company.\nPrior to the Spin-off, the Company incurred operating losses and had negative cash flow from operations, despite positive financial results from what was then the performance marketing segment of our business. Since the Spin-off, we have begun to generate net income and positive cash flow from continuing operations. We may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a stand-alone operating company or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all, in which case, we may not be able to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future.\nUnder the Separation Agreement, we agreed to indemnify Red Violet for certain liabilities.\nUnder the Separation Agreement, Fluent agreed to indemnify Red Violet for certain liabilities. Although no such liabilities are known or anticipated, we cannot assure you that liabilities will not arise. If we have to indemnify Red Violet for unanticipated liabilities, the cost of such indemnification obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control. As a result, the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may have a significant impact on the trading price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of new competitors or new technologies;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly-traded companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions or pursuant to our stock incentive plans could have a dilutive effect on your investment in us.\nDuring 2017 and 2018 we issued 22,807,585 shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions, vesting of awards made under our 2008 Share Incentive Plan, our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, and our 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"Plans\" collectively), or for other business purposes. Also, as of December 31, 2018, an additional 9,352,658 shares underlying awards made under the Plans, outstanding warrants and other compensatory arrangements might vest and be delivered through 2021. The benefits derived by us from any future acquisition might not exceed the dilutive effect of the acquisition. Pursuant to the Plans, our board of directors has granted and may continue to grant stock options, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), or other equity awards to our directors and employees. When these awards vest or are exercised, the issuance of shares of common stock underlying these awards may have a dilutive effect on our common stock, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership may limit individual stockholder ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our executive officers, directors and holders of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned and have the ability to exercise some voting control over, in the aggregate, approximately 44.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. As a result, these stockholders may be in a position to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and determination of significant corporate actions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and these stockholders may act in a manner that advances their interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, which might affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our Credit Agreement prohibits us from paying dividends on our equity securities, other than dividends on common stock which accrue (but are not paid in cash) or are paid in kind, or dividends on preferred stock which accrue (but are not paid in cash) or are paid in kind. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.", "PERMNO": 92486, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "FLNT"}
