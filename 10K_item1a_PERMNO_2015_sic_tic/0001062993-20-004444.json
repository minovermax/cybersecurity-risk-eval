{"cik": "1041514", "company": "NET 1 UEPS TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business. We are unable to ascertain the impact the pandemic will have on our future financial position, operations, cash flows and stock price.\nOur business has been, and continues to be, impacted by government restrictions and quarantines related to COVID-19. Like many other companies, we have been subject to government-imposed restrictions on, among other things, pricing for certain products and services and our ability to sell certain \"non-essential\" services. For example, until June 1, 2020, the restrictions imposed by the South African government suspended our lending and other financial services activities, and imposed limitations on the level of banking-related fees that we were permitted to charge our customers, which consequently impacted our business. Most employees in South Africa, including many of our employees, were required to work from home following the publication of government-imposed restrictions. Governments, including the South African government, have recommended that employees continue to work from home even after mandatory quarantine requirements were relaxed. As a result of the work from home environment, we face additional challenges providing employees with secure remote access to computer networks as well as initiating and accepting instructions via e-mail or other electronic media. Responsible action to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic may impact productivity and introduce new operating risks to us, our business partners, customers and suppliers.\nOur business model depends on the expansion of our financial services activities in South Africa and relies on face-to-face interactions with our customers. As a result of the restrictions described above, our business was significantly and adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. In particular, we were unable to charge fees for certain transactions and were not permitted to originate loans or sell insurance policies through face-to-face interactions for a period of time. Going forward, we believe that our business activities will be adversely impacted if stricter restrictions are reintroduced to combat the spread of the pandemic. Furthermore, should there be an increase in mortality rates across our customer base, we may see an increase in microloan defaults and funeral policy claim payouts.\nIn addition to the adverse consequences on our business as described above, the pandemic has impacted global markets, including reduced economic activity and increased market volatility. Our stock price may be influenced by these events.\nWe are unable to accurately predict the impact of the pandemic and government-imposed restrictions on our future financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price. Circumstances may change rapidly as matters related to the pandemic evolve.\nWe have recently modified our business strategy to focus on South Africa, and to exit or reduce our activities outside the African continent. Our future success, and our ability to return to profitability and positive cash flow is substantially dependent on our ability to implement this strategy successfully.\nDuring the last several months, our board has conducted an extensive review of our business strategy and operations. After completion of the strategic review in July 2020, our board has determined to focus on our South African operations and other business opportunities in South Africa and to a lesser extent, the rest of the African continent, and to exit or reduce our presence in other geographies. Our future success will depend on our ability to deploy the significant levels of cash generated from our recent asset dispositions effectively and efficiently. Any new businesses that we acquire or strategic investments that we make may not generate the level of returns that we expect them to generate. Further, we may face difficulty in optimizing the disposal of our non-African assets and operations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our new strategy successfully and return to profitability and positive cash flow.\nEven if we do return to profitability, achieving net income does not necessarily ensure positive cash flows. Future periods of net losses from operations could result in negative cash flow and may hamper ongoing operations and prevent us from sustaining or expanding our business. We cannot assure you that we will achieve, sustain or increase profitability in the future and if we do not, our business will be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the price of our common stock, which has declined substantially over the past several years, may not recover or decline even further if we do not successfully execute our new strategy.\nFurther, as we exit our other non-core operations and strategic investments, we may have charges associated with the write-down of assets and closure of certain of the regulated entities we operate may adversely impact our relationship with regulators. It may be difficult to dispose of some or all of these operations or investments on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe face challenges in transforming our South African operations to a business-to-consumer model through our various bank account products and ATM infrastructure.\nFollowing the conclusion of the SASSA contract on September 30, 2018, we refocused our resources and technology on the provision of financial inclusion services to our target market. In particular, we enabled our mobile ATM payment infrastructure to become part of the South African National Payment System and concentrated on taking our ATMs to the rural populations of South Africa so that they have the same access to financial inclusion as they had during the tenure of our contract, without the many inconveniences and inefficiencies of SASSA's new payment model. While we believe that our financial services offerings are convenient and cost-effective, the success of our strategy will depend on the extent to which South African customers continue to use our financial products and services on a widespread basis.\nFactors that may prevent us from successfully operating and growing our South African financial services business include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 reduced adoption and utilization of our EPE accounts and related products and services;\n\u2022 insufficient utilization of our ATM infrastructure, especially our mobile ATM infrastructure;\n\u2022 inability to access sufficient funding for our ATM infrastructure;\n\u2022 competition in the marketplace;\n\u2022 restrictions imposed by SASSA or government on the manner in which recipients may transact;\n\u2022 additional and/or protracted legal proceedings with SASSA or other parties;\n\u2022 political interference;\n\u2022 changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u2022 dependence on existing suppliers to provide the hardware (such as ATMs, cards and POS devices) we require to execute our rollout as anticipated;\n\u2022 logistical and communications challenges; and\n\u2022 loss of key technical and operations staff.\nCPS has been involved in continuous litigation for a number of years in relation to its contract with SASSA. Two of these cases may present a risk to us if a court were to hold us responsible for CPS' liabilities.\nThe first case relates to the February 2020 order of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, or Constitutional Court, the highest court in South Africa, rejecting CPS' appeal of a lower court judgment ordering CPS to repay SASSA more than ZAR 316 million, plus interest, of contract implementation costs reimbursed to CPS in 2014, thus exhausting CPS legal remedies in this case. Because CPS' liability on this judgment substantially exceeds the value of its assets, CPS has, pursuant to a resolution of its board, been placed into business rescue, which is a South African process similar to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. SASSA is seeking to set aside the business rescue and has brought an application to liquidate CPS instead in order to hold inquiries into the affairs of CPS. Refer also to \"Item 3.-Legal Proceedings-CPS placed into business rescue and SASSA application to place CPS into liquidation.\"\nThe second case arises from the 2012 order of the Gauteng Division of the High Court of South Africa, or High Court, declaring the invalidity of the SASSA contract and requiring CPS to file a financial statement, to be audited by independent auditors, detailing CPS' revenues earned, expenses incurred and profits derived from the SASSA contract. After CPS filed two independent audit verification reports (and after SASSA filed one such report as well), Freedom Under Law, or FUL, a South African non-governmental organization, made an application to the Constitutional Court alleging that CPS underreported its profits from the SASSA contract and requested the Constitutional Court to order CPS to repay such profits. CPS has opposed FUL's request on the basis that FUL is asking for new relief that does not fall under the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. Refer also to \"Item 3.-Legal Proceedings- Freedom Under Law application to the Constitutional Court.\"\nWhile no claim has been made against us that we should be held liable for the obligations of CPS resulting from the February 2020 Constitutional Court order or from any potential judgment ordering CPS to repay its contract profits, and while we do not believe that there would be a legitimate legal basis for any such claims, we cannot assure you that any such claim will not be made against us. If SASSA or another third party were to seek and ultimately succeed in obtaining a judgment against us in respect of CPS' liabilities, any such judgment would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to operate effectively and efficiently in South Africa in the future will be adversely impacted if we are unable to communicate persuasively that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the customers who purchase our financial services products.\nThe South African public, media, non-governmental organizations and political parties have utilized a number of platforms, including social media, to criticize SASSA over its failure to implement the orders of the Constitutional Court over the last two years and express their dissatisfaction with the state of affairs. Among the criticisms, we have been accused of being responsible for SASSA's inability to bring the payment service in-house. In addition, we were publicly accused of illegally providing our services and defrauding social welfare grant recipients. We have publicly denied these accusations and believe they have no merit.\nOur reputation in South Africa has been tarnished as a result of these accusations. We have attempted to refute the allegations made against us and have appointed a public relations firm to assist us in communicating effectively to the public and our stakeholders that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the social welfare grant recipients who purchase the financial services products that we offer. It is difficult to quantify to what extent we have been successful in effectively repudiating these unsubstantiated allegations against us. If we are unable to communicate persuasively that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the customers who purchase our financial services products, our ability to operate effectively and efficiently in South Africa in the future will be adversely impacted, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or lengthy or severe recession in South Africa or elsewhere could harm our operations.\nA prolonged economic downturn or recession in South Africa could materially impact our results from operations, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and our strategic decision to focus on our South African operations. Economic confidence in South Africa, our main operating environment, is currently low and, as a result, the risk of a prolonged economic downturn is enhanced. A recessionary economic environment could have a negative impact on mobile phone operators, our cardholders and retailers and could reduce the level of transactions we process, the take-up of the financial services we offer and the ability of our customers to repay our microloans or to pay their insurance premiums, which would, in turn, negatively impact our financial results. If financial institutions and retailers experience decreased demand for their products and services, our hardware, software and related technology sales will decrease, resulting in lower revenue.\nWe may undertake acquisitions or make strategic investments that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business.\nAcquisitions and strategic investments are an integral part of our new growth strategy as we seek to grow our business and to deploy our technologies in new markets in South Africa. However, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition or investment candidates at prices that we consider appropriate. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition or investment candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of the transaction, finance it or, if the transaction occurs, integrate the new business into our existing business. These transactions may require debt financing or additional equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership.\nAcquisitions of businesses or other material operations and the integration of these acquisitions or their businesses will require significant attention from our senior management which may divert their attention from our day to day business. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. We also may not be able to retain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. Acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition.\nWe may need to record write-downs from future impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recognized impairment losses of $6.3 million, $14.4 million and $20.9 million, respectively. In addition, as disclosed in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements, one of our strategic partners, Finbond, restated its consolidated financial statements, which impacted our reported results and caused us to restate our 2019 and 2018 financial statements to correct for the Finbond restatement. If, in the future, any similar events occur, additional restatements may be required, which could impact our reported earnings.\nOur ability to fund our ATM network requires that we continue to have access to sufficient lending facilities which require compliance with restrictive and financial covenants.\nThe expansion of our fixed and mobile ATM network, along with an increase in our consumer banking client base, necessitates access to large amounts of cash to stock the ATMs and maintain uninterrupted service levels. We have credit facilities from Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited, or RMB, and Nedbank Limited, South African banks. Our RMB debt facility expires in September 2020. We may not be able to extend the terms of these debt facilities or refinance, in each case, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, any adverse change to the terms of our credit facilities, a significant reduction in the amounts available under our credit facilities, or our failure to increase our facilities if required, will have an adverse impact on our ability to continue uninterrupted operation of our ATM network and our revenues from this business. We will also suffer reputational damage if our service levels are negatively impacted due to the unavailability of cash.\nOur facilities are secured by intercompany cross-guarantees, a guarantee from Net1 and a pledge by Net1 SA of its entire equity interest in Cell C. The terms of the lending arrangement contain covenants that require Net1 SA to maintain certain asset cover ratios and restrict the ability of Net1 SA, and certain of its subsidiaries to make certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, prepay other debt, encumber their assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investment above specified levels, engage in certain business combinations and engage in other corporate activities without the approval of the lenders. These security arrangements and covenants may reduce our operating flexibility or our ability to engage in other transactions that may be beneficial to us. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in South Africa, we could be in default and the indebtedness could be accelerated. If this were to occur, we might not be able to obtain waivers of default or to refinance the debt with another lender and as a result, our business and financial condition would suffer.\nWe may be unable to recover the carrying value of certain Cell C airtime that we own which is subject to resale restrictions.\nWe own a substantial amount of Cell C airtime inventory ($14.3 million translated at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2020). We have entered into an agreement with our co-shareholder in Cell C under which $4.2 million of the airtime inventory may only be sold after October 1, 2020. These restrictions expose us to market risk for this inventory. The balance of the airtime acquired was subject to resale restrictions through April 1, 2020 and is not readily saleable in the current market without realising a loss. In light of this, we recorded a loss of $1.3 million during fiscal 2020, related to this airtime inventory. We may be required to record further losses in the future or we may be unable to recover the carrying value of this airtime inventory as a result of the business failure of Cell C. Failure to recover the carrying value of this inventory may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur microlending loan book exposes us to credit risk and our allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable may not be sufficient to absorb future write-offs.\nAll of our microfinance loans made are for a period of six months or less. We have created an allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable related to this book. Management has considered factors including the period of the finance loan outstanding, creditworthiness of the customers and the past payment history of the borrower when creating the allowance. We consider this policy to be appropriate taking into account factors such as historical bad debts, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns. However, additional allowances may be required should the ability of our customers to make payments when due deteriorate in the future. In particular, we cannot predict the impact the current pandemic may have on collections, though to date we have not experienced any material deterioration in collection rates. A significant amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these finance loan receivables, including on-going evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer.\nWe face competition from the incumbent retail banks in South Africa and SAPO in the unbanked market segment, which could limit our growth.\nCertain South African banks have also developed their own low-cost banking products targeted at the unbanked and underbanked market segment. According to the 2018 FinScope SA 2018 Fact Sheet, a survey conducted by the FinMark Trust, a non-profit independent trust, 80% of South Africans are banked. As the competition to bank the unbanked in South Africa intensifies, we may not be successful in marketing our low-cost products to our target population. Moreover, as our product offerings increase, gain market acceptance and pose a competitive threat in South Africa, especially our UEPS/EMV product with biometric verification and our financial services offerings, the banks and SAPO may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as disrupting their transactional or other businesses.\nWe may face competition from other companies that offer innovative payment technologies and payment processing, which could result in the loss of our existing business and adversely impact our ability to successfully market additional products and services.\nOur primary competitors in the payment processing market include other independent processors, as well as financial institutions, independent sales organizations, new digital and fintech entrants and, potentially card networks. Many of our competitors are companies who are larger than we are and have greater financial and operational resources than we have. These factors may allow them to offer better pricing terms or incentives to customers, which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well. Either of these actions could have a significant effect on our revenues and earnings.\nIn addition to competition that our UEPS system faces from the use of cash, checks, credit and debit cards, existing payment systems and the providers of financial services and low-cost bank accounts, there are a number of other products that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system. During the past several years, smart card technology has become increasingly prevalent. We believe that the most competitive product in this marketplace is EMV, a system that is promoted by most of the major card companies such as Visa, MasterCard, JCB and American Express. Also, governments and financial institutions are, to an increasing extent, implementing general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards as a low-cost alternative to provide financial services to the unbanked population. Moreover, as the acceptance of using a mobile phone to facilitate financial services has increased exponentially, other companies have introduced such services to the marketplace successfully and customers may prefer those services to ours, based on technology, price or other factors.\nWe are in the process of transitioning to a new chief executive officer. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage this transition successfully, and to attract, integrate, retain and incentivize other key personnel.\nOn August 5, 2020, we announced that Herman G. Kotz\u00e9 will resign from his position as our chief executive officer and as a member of our board of directors, effective as of September 30, 2020. Alex M.R. Smith, our chief financial officer, will serve as interim chief executive officer upon Mr. Kotz\u00e9's departure, until the board of directors finalizes the appointment of a permanent chief executive officer. We have entered into a consultancy agreement with Mr. Kotz\u00e9, which is effective for the period from December 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021. Replacing a departing chief executive officer can involve organizational disruption and uncertainty. If we fail to manage this transition successfully, we could experience significant delays or difficulty in the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe must also attract, retain and motivate additional highly-qualified employees. We may experience difficulty in managing transitions and assimilating our newly-hired personnel, which may adversely affect our business. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense. Competitors may attempt to recruit our top management and employees. In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive pay packages, including cash and equity-based compensation and the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. Many of our key responsibilities in South Africa are currently performed by Messrs. Kotz\u00e9 and Smith, as well as by Mr. Nanda Pillay, our Managing Director: Southern Africa. We do not maintain any \"key person\" life insurance policies. If we fail to attract, integrate, retain and incentivize key personnel, our ability to manage and grow our business could be harmed.\nWe face a highly competitive employment market and may not be successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled employees, particularly in the technical and sales areas and senior management.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to develop new products and to market these products to our targeted users. In order to succeed in our product development and marketing efforts, we need to identify, attract, motivate and retain sufficient numbers of qualified technical and sales personnel. An inability to hire and retain such technical personnel would adversely affect our ability to enhance our existing intellectual property, to introduce new generations of technology and to keep abreast of current developments in technology. Demand for personnel with the range of capabilities and experience we require is high and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining these employees. The risk exists that our technical skills and sales base may be depleted over time because of natural attrition. Furthermore, social and economic factors in South Africa have led, and continue to lead, to numerous qualified individuals leaving the country, thus depleting the availability of qualified personnel in South Africa. If we cannot recruit and retain people with the appropriate capabilities and experience and effectively integrate these people into our business, it could negatively affect our product development and marketing activities.\nSystem failures, including breaches in the security of our system, could harm our business.\nWe may experience system failures from time to time, and any lengthy interruption in the availability of our back-end system computer could harm our business, and could subject us to the scrutiny of our customers. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers and users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to avoid our technology altogether, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. These interruptions would increase the burden on our staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new applications and services. Finally, because our customers may use our products for critical transactions, any system failures could result in damage to our customers' businesses. These customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim could be time consuming and costly for us to address.\nAlthough our systems have been designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.\nProtection against fraud is of key importance to the purchasers and end users of our solutions. We incorporate security features, including encryption software, biometric identification and secure hardware, into our solutions to protect against fraud in electronic transactions and to provide for the privacy and integrity of card holder data. Our solutions may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to defects in the security mechanisms, the operating system and applications or the hardware platform. Security vulnerabilities could jeopardize the security of information transmitted using our solutions. If the security of our solutions is compromised, our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our solutions will be adversely affected, which would cause our business to suffer, and we may become subject to damage claims. We have not yet experienced any significant security breaches affecting our business.\nDespite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our system could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Our current business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies.\nOur success depends in part on our obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark protection of our technologies in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as successfully enforcing this intellectual property and defending this intellectual property against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable intellectual property protections, such as patents or trade secrets, cover them. In particular, we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.\nWe cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. For example, we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and patent applications or to file patent applications and it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents. It is possible that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies. Also, our issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, or may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have confidentiality agreements with employees, and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. These agreements may be breached and/or may not have adequate remedies for such breach. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants or others may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, our enforcement efforts would be expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, it will be more difficult for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed. If we are not able to defend the patent or trade secret protection position of our technologies, then we will not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing technologies.\nWe also rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for some of our products. To maintain the value of our trademarks, we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. Also, we might not obtain registrations for our pending trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending trademark applications from challenge by third parties.\nDefending our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves in infringement suits that may be brought against us is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful.\nLitigation to enforce our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets could result in substantial costs and may not be successful. Any loss of, or inability to protect, intellectual property in our technology could diminish our competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws in countries where we currently have patent protection. Our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in countries where we currently have patent or trademark protection, or any other country in which we operate, may not be adequate to fully protect our intellectual property rights. Similarly, if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote substantial resources to the defense of such claims. We may be required to discontinue using and selling any infringing technology and services, to expend resources to develop non-infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties for other technology. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending any such third-party claims, we could suffer costly judgments and injunctions that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur strategy of partnering with third parties may not be successful.\nWe conduct certain business activities, including outside South Africa, through strategic partnering arrangements with third parties. In such circumstances, we typically acquire a minority interest in an operating company in which a strategic partner also has an interest. While the relevant strategic partner may have primary responsibility for, among other things, the day-to-day business operations of the relevant strategic partnership, we typically retain certain elements of control, such as the ability to vote for or appoint members to the board (or equivalent) of such strategic partnerships, having input into management of those partnerships, and/or maintaining major decision rights with respect to operations. To the extent that we maintain such strategic partnership arrangements, we may not realize the expected benefits from these investments. The success of these endeavors is subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control. For example, we may depend on our partners to provide knowledge of local market conditions and to facilitate the acquisition of any necessary licenses and permits. Additionally, although we typically retain certain elements of control, we are not able to completely direct the policies and strategies of these operating companies.\nSuch limits to our control could result in the loss of all or part of our investment in such entities. In addition, our foreign partners may have different business methods and customs which may be unfamiliar to us and with which we disagree. Furthermore, limitations imposed on our South African subsidiaries by South African exchange control regulations may limit our ability to establish partnerships or entities outside South Africa in which we do not obtain a controlling interest.\nAdditionally, our minority interest ownership of entities with our strategic partners may be deemed to be \u201cinvestment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 3(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, which could cause us to be deemed to be an investment company within the meaning of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. For more information, please refer to the risk factor, \u201cWe may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\u201d\nWe may incur material losses in connection with our distribution of cash through our payment infrastructure in South Africa.\nMany cardholders use our services to access cash using their debit cards. We use armored vehicles and our own fixed ATM infrastructure to deliver large amounts of cash to rural areas across South Africa to enable these cardholders to receive this cash. In some cases, we also store the cash that will be delivered by the armored vehicles in depots overnight or over the weekend to facilitate delivery to these rural areas. We cannot insure against certain risks of loss or theft of cash from our delivery vehicles, ATMs or depots and we will therefore bear the full cost of certain uninsured losses or theft in connection with the cash handling process, and such losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We have not incurred any material losses resulting from cash distribution in recent years, but there is no assurance that we will not incur material losses in the future.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nWe obtain our smart cards, ATMs, POS devices and the other hardware we use in our business from a limited number of suppliers, and do not manufacture this equipment ourselves. We generally do not have long-term agreements with our manufacturers or component suppliers. If our suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of parts or products when we need them, or if they increase their prices, we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and could be faced with a critical shortage. This could harm our ability to implement new systems and cause our revenues to decline. Even if we are able to secure alternative sources in a timely manner, our costs could increase. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond current suppliers' capabilities could harm our ability to distribute our equipment and thus, to acquire a new source of customers who use our technology. Any interruption in the supply of the hardware necessary to operate our technology, or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur Smart Life business exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies.\nSmart Life is a life insurance company and exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies. Some of these risks include the extent to which we are able to continue to reinsure our risks at acceptable costs, reinsurer counterparty risk, maintaining regulatory capital adequacy, solvency and liquidity requirements, our ability to price our insurance products appropriately, the risk that actual claims experience may exceed our estimates, the ability to recover policy premiums from our customers and the competitiveness of the South African insurance market. If we are unable to maintain our desired level of reinsurance at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk or reduce our insurance writings. If our reinsurers are unable to meet their commitments to us in a timely manner, or at all, we may be unable to discharge our obligations under our insurance contracts. As such, we are exposed to counterparty, including credit, risk of these reinsurers.\nOur product pricing includes long-term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business. Using the wrong assumptions to price our insurance products could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our actual claims experience is higher than our estimates, particularly in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Finally, the South African insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are well-established, represented nationally and market similar products and we may not be able to effectively penetrate the South African insurance market.\nRisks Relating to Operating in South Africa and Other Foreign Markets\nIf we do not achieve applicable broad-based black economic empowerment objectives in our South African businesses, we risk losing our government and/or private contracts and/or risk not being in compliance with any government and/or private contracts which we have already entered into. In addition, it is possible that we may be required to increase the black shareholding of our company in a manner that could dilute your ownership and/or change the companies from which we purchase goods or procure services (to companies with a better BEE Contributor Status Level).\nThe legislative framework for the promotion of broad-based black economic empowerment, or BEE, in South Africa has been established through the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, No. 53 of 2003, as amended from time to time, and the Amended BEE Codes of Good Practice, 2013, or BEE Codes, and any sector-specific codes of good practice, or Sector Codes, published pursuant thereto. Sector Codes are fully binding between and among businesses operating in a sector for which a Sector Code has been published. Achievement of BEE objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting for the various elements. Save for certain instances where entities are only required to obtain an affidavit (for example, exempted micro enterprises and a qualifying small enterprise that is 51% Black Owned or 100% Black Owned (as defined in the BEE Codes and/or Sector Codes)), scorecards are independently reviewed by accredited BEE verification agencies which issue a certificate that presents an entity's BEE Contributor Status Level.\nCertain of our South African businesses are subject to either the Information, Communications and Technology Sector Code, or ICT Sector Code, or the Financial Services Sector Code. The ICT Sector Code has been amended and aligned with the new BEE Codes and was promulgated in November 2016. Likewise, the Financial Services Sector Code has been amended and aligned with the new BEE Codes and was promulgated in December 2017.\nThe BEE scorecard includes a component relating to management control, which serves to determine the participation of black people at various levels of management within a measured entity (including, inter alia, at Board level, Executive Management, Senior Management, Middle Management and Junior Management). The BEE Codes and/or Sector Codes define the terms \"Senior Management\", \"Middle Management\" and \"Junior Management\" as those occupational categories as determined in accordance with the Employment Equity Regulations. Annexure EEA9 to the Employment Equity Regulations sets out the various occupational levels which are determined in accordance with the relevant grading systems applied by the measured entity and referred to in the said Annexure. Employment equity legislation seeks to drive the alignment of the workforce with the racial composition of South Africa. The proposed legislation aims to accelerate the achievement of employment equity targets, introducing monetary fines for non-achievement. Failing to meet these targets may expose us to fines.\nWe have taken a number of actions as a company to increase empowerment of black (as defined under applicable regulations) South Africans. However, it is possible that these actions may not be sufficient to enable us to achieve applicable BEE objectives. In that event, in order to avoid risking the loss of our government and private contracts, we may have to seek to comply through other means, including by selling or placing additional shares of Net1 or of our South African subsidiaries to black South Africans (either directly or indirectly). Such sales or placements of shares could have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nWe expect that our BEE Contributor Status Level will be important for us in order to remain competitive in the South African marketplace and we continually seek ways to improve our BEE Contributor Status Level, especially the ownership (so-called \"equity element\") element thereof. We have entered into various BEE transactions in the past in an effort to improve our score, including transactions in which we issued equity to BEE partners.\nIt is possible that we may find it necessary to issue additional shares to improve our BEE Contributor Status Level. If we enter into further BEE transactions that involve the issuance of equity, we cannot predict what the dilutive effect of such a transaction would be on your ownership or how it would affect the market price of our stock.\nFluctuations in the value of the South African rand have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our reported results of operations, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business performance between reporting periods and may also adversely affect our stock price.\nThe South African rand, or ZAR, is the primary operating currency for our business operations while our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. This means that as long as the ZAR remains our primary operating currency, depreciation in the ZAR against the U.S. dollar, would negatively impact our reported revenue and net income, while a strengthening of the ZAR would have the opposite effect. Depreciation in the ZAR may negatively impact the prices at which our stock trades. The U.S. dollar/ZAR exchange rate has historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue. We provide detailed information about historical exchange rates in Item 7 - \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Currency Exchange Rate Information.\"\nDue to the significant fluctuation in the value of the ZAR and its impact on our reported results, you may find it difficult to compare our results of operations between financial reporting periods even though we provide supplemental information about our results of operations determined on a ZAR basis. It may also have a negative impact on our stock price.\nWe generally do not engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations, other than economic hedging relating to our inventory purchases which are settled in U.S. dollars or euros. We have used forward contracts in order to hedge our economic exposure to the ZAR/U.S. dollar and ZAR/euro exchange rate fluctuations from these foreign currency transactions. We cannot guarantee that we will enter into hedging transactions in the future or, if we do, that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations.\nSouth Africa's high levels of poverty, unemployment and crime may increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain a qualified workforce\nWhile South Africa has a highly developed financial and legal infrastructure, it also has high levels of crime and unemployment, relative to peer countries in Africa and other emerging economies, and there are significant differences in the level of economic and social development among its people, with large parts of the population, particularly in the rural areas, having limited access to adequate education, healthcare, housing and other basic services, including water and electricity. In addition, South Africa has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Government policies aimed at alleviating and redressing the disadvantages suffered by the majority of citizens under previous governments may increase our costs and reduce our profitability, all of which could negatively affect our business. These problems may prompt emigration of skilled workers, hinder investment into South Africa and impede economic growth. As a result, we may have difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees.\nWe may not be able to effectively and efficiently manage the electricity supply disruptions in South Africa, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and future growth.\nOur businesses in South Africa are dependent on electricity generated and supplied by the state-owned utility, Eskom, in order to operate. In recent years, Eskom has been unable to generate and supply the amount of electricity required by South Africans, and the entire country experienced significant and often unpredictable electricity supply disruptions. Eskom has implemented a number of short- and long-term mitigation plans to correct these issues but supply disruptions continue to occur regularly and with no predictability. Eskom requires significant funding from the South African government in order to continue to operate.\nAs part of our business continuity programs, we have installed back-up diesel generators in order for us to continue to operate our core data processing facilities in Cape Town and Johannesburg in the event of intermittent disruptions to our electricity supply. We have to perform regular monitoring and maintenance of these generators as well as sourcing and managing diesel fuel levels. We may also be required to replace these generators on a more frequent basis due to the additional burden placed on them.\nOur results of operations, financial position, cash flows and future growth could be adversely affected if Eskom is unable raise sufficient funding to operate and/ or to commission new electricity-generating power stations in accordance with its plans, or at all, or if we are unable to effectively and efficiently test, maintain, source fuel for and replace our generators.\nThe economy of South Africa is exposed to high inflation, interest rates and rates of corporate tax, which could increase our operating costs and thereby reduce our profitability. Furthermore, the South African government requires additional income to fund future government expenditures and may be required, among other things, to increase existing income taxes rates, including the corporate income tax rate, amend existing tax legislation or introduce additional taxes.\nThe economy of South Africa in the past has been, and in the future may continue to be, characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the United States and other highly developed economies. High rates of inflation could increase our South African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. Higher interest rates increase the cost of our debt financing, though conversely they also increase the amount of income we earn on any cash balances. The South African corporate income tax rate, of 28%, is higher than the U.S. federal income tax rate, of 21%. The South African government has announced a number of programs and initiatives that may require funding from a variety of sources, including from an increase in existing tax rates, including the corporate income tax rate; amendments to existing South African tax legislation; or through the introduction of additional taxes. An increase in the effective South African corporate income tax rate will adversely impact our profitability and cash flow generation.\nSouth African exchange control regulations could hinder our ability to make foreign investments and obtain foreign-denominated financing.\nSouth Africa's exchange control regulations restrict the export of capital from South Africa, the Republic of Namibia and the Kingdoms of Lesotho and Swaziland, known collectively as the Common Monetary Area, without the prior approval of the South African Reserve Bank, or SARB. While the South African government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years, it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further relax or abolish exchange control measures in the foreseeable future.\nAlthough Net1 is a U.S. corporation and is not itself subject to South African exchange control regulations, these regulations do restrict the ability of our South African subsidiaries to raise and deploy capital outside the Common Monetary Area, to borrow money in currencies other than the South African rand and to hold foreign currency. Exchange control restrictions may also affect the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Net1 unless the affected subsidiary can show that any payment of such dividend will not place it in an over-borrowed position. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 20% of our cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) were held by our South African subsidiaries. Exchange control regulations could make it difficult for our South African subsidiaries to: (i) export capital from South Africa; (ii) hold foreign currency or incur indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies without the approval of SARB; or (iii) acquire an interest in a foreign venture without the approval of SARB and first having complied with the investment criteria of SARB.\nUnder current exchange control regulations, SARB approval would be required for any acquisition of our company which would involve payment to our South African shareholders of any consideration other than South African rand. This restriction could limit our management in its ability to consider strategic options and thus, our shareholders may not be able to realize a premium over the current trading price of our shares.\nOperating in South Africa and other emerging markets subjects us to greater risks than those we would face if we operated in more developed markets.\nEmerging markets such as South Africa, as well as some of the other markets in which we have investments or operations, including African countries outside South Africa and South and Southeast Asia, are subject to greater risks than more developed markets. While we focus our business primarily on emerging markets because that is where we perceive to be the greatest opportunities to market our products and services successfully, the political, economic and market conditions in many of these markets present risks that could make it more difficult to operate our business successfully.\nSome of these risks include:\n\u2022 political and economic instability, including higher rates of inflation and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022 high levels of corruption, including bribery of public officials;\n\u2022 loss due to civil strife, acts of war or terrorism, guerrilla activities and insurrection;\n\u2022 a lack of well-developed legal systems which could make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights;\n\u2022 logistical, utilities (including electricity and water supply) and communications challenges;\n\u2022 potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices, including import and export license requirements and restrictions, tariffs, legal structures and tax laws;\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing operations and ensuring the safety of our employees;\n\u2022 restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets;\n\u2022 greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\n\u2022 indigenization and empowerment programs;\n\u2022 exposure to liability under the UK Bribery Act; and\u2022 exposure to liability under U.S. securities and foreign trade laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and regulations established by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.\n\u2022 exposure to liability under U.S. securities and foreign trade laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and regulations established by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.\nMany of these countries and regions are in various stages of developing institutions and political, legal and regulatory systems that are characteristic of democracies. However, institutions in these countries and regions may not yet be as firmly established as they are in democracies in the developed world. Many of these countries and regions are also in the process of transitioning to a market economy and, as a result, are experiencing changes in their economies and their government policies that can affect our investments in these countries and regions.\nMoreover, the procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory regimes in these countries and regions are still being developed and, therefore, existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. In some circumstances, it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided under those laws and regulations in a timely manner. As the political, economic and legal environments remain subject to continuous development, investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the security of their investments. Any unexpected changes in the political or economic conditions in these or neighboring countries or others in the region may have a material adverse effect on the investments that we have made or may make in the future, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation\nThe South African National Credit Regulator has applied to cancel the registration of our subsidiary, Moneyline Financial Services (Pty) Ltd, as a credit provider. If the registration is cancelled, we will not be able to provide loans to our customers, which would harm our business.\nMoneyline provides microloans to our EPE cardholders. Moneyline is a registered credit provider under the South African National Credit Act, or NCA, and is required to comply with the NCA in the operation of its lending business. In September 2014, the South African National Credit Regulator, or NCR, applied to the National Consumer Tribunal to cancel Moneyline's registration, based on an investigation concluded by the NCR.\nThe NCR has alleged, among other things, that Moneyline contravened the NCA by including child support grants and foster child grants in the affordability assessments performed by Moneyline prior to granting credit to these borrowers, and that the procedures followed and documentation maintained by Moneyline are not in accordance with the NCA. We believe that Moneyline has conducted its business in compliance with NCA and we are opposing the NCR's application. However, if the NCR's application is successful, Moneyline would be prohibited from operating its microlending business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to comply with certain laws and regulations, including economic and trade sanctions, which could adversely impact our future growth.\nWe are subject to U.S. and other trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation. Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign trade control laws and regulations, including various export controls and economic sanctions programs, such as those administered by OFAC, as well as European sanctions. We monitor compliance in accordance with the 10 principles as set out in the United Nations Global Compact Principles, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recommendations relating to corruption, and the International Labor Organization Protocol in terms of certain of the items to be monitored. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating trade control laws as well as sanctions regulations.\nEconomic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons and entities. In addition, because we act through dealers and distributors, we face the risk that our dealers, distributors and customers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations.\nViolations of trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have developed policies and procedures as part of a company-wide compliance program that is designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international trade control laws and regulations, including trade controls and sanctions programs administered by OFAC, and provide regular training to our employees to comply with these laws and regulations.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our expansion in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships, could increase the risk of OFAC violations in the future.\nIn addition, our payment processing activities are subject to extensive regulation. Compliance with the requirements under the various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.\nWe are required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the FCPA and UK Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business, which could adversely impact our future growth.\nThe FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA.\nIn addition, we have to comply with the UK Bribery Act which includes provisions that extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals not employed by a government. The provisions of the UK Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. Some of the international locations in which we operate, lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption.\nAny failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees, agents and business partners comply with the FCPA could subject us to substantial penalties. In addition, the requirement that we comply with the FCPA could put us at a competitive disadvantage with companies that are not required to comply with the FCPA or could otherwise harm our business. For example, in many emerging markets, there may be significant levels of official corruption, and thus, bribery of public officials may be a commonly accepted cost of doing business. Our refusal to engage in illegal behavior, such as paying bribes, may result in us not being able to obtain business that we might otherwise have been able to secure or possibly even result in unlawful, selective or arbitrary action being taken against us by foreign officials.\nViolations of anti-corruption laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have developed policies and procedures as part of a company-wide compliance program that is designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and regulations, and provide regular training to our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSince less developed countries present some of the best opportunities for us to expand our business internationally, restrictions against entering into transactions with those foreign countries, as well as with certain entities and individuals in those countries, can adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe do not have a South African banking license and, therefore, we provide our EPE solution through an arrangement with a third-party bank, which limits our control over this business and the economic benefit we derive from it. If this arrangement were to terminate, we would not be able to operate our EPE business without alternate means of access to a banking license.\nThe South African retail banking market is highly regulated. Under current law and regulations, our EPE business activities require us to be registered as a bank in South Africa or to have access to an existing banking license. We are not currently so registered, but we have an agreement with Grindrod Bank that enables us to implement our EPE program in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations. If the agreement were to be terminated, we would not be able to operate these services unless we were able to obtain access to a banking license through alternate means. We are also dependent on Grindrod Bank to defend us against attacks from the other South African banks who may regard our products as disruptive to their funds transfer or other businesses and may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention. Furthermore, we have to comply with the strict anti-money laundering and customer identification regulations of the SARB when we open new bank accounts for our customers and when they transact. Failure to effectively implement and monitor these regulations may result in significant fines or prosecution of Grindrod Bank and ourselves.\nWe have commenced issuing consumer banking products through our relationship with Finbond, in the form of our Kanako and Infinity products, with Finbond taking the place of Grindrod in respect of these products. However, it would not be readily achievable to transfer our EPE solution from Grindrod to Finbond.\nIn addition, the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002, requires persons who act as intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in South Africa to register as financial service providers. Smart Life was granted an Authorized Financial Service Provider, or FSP, license on June 9, 2015, and Moneyline Financial Services (Pty) Ltd and Net1 Mobile Solutions (Pty) Ltd were each granted FSP licenses on July 11, 2017. If our FSP licenses are cancelled, we may be stopped from continuing our financial services businesses in South Africa.\nFurthermore, the proposed Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill will make significant changes to the current licensing regime. While the proposals currently indicate that existing licenses will be converted, if we are not successful in our efforts to obtain a conversion of the existing licenses, we may be stopped from continuing our financial services businesses in South Africa.\nWe may be subject to regulations regarding privacy, data use and/or security, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to regulations in a number of the countries in which we operate relating to the processing (which includes, inter alia, the collection, use, retention, security and transfer) of personal information about the people (whether natural or juristic) who use our products and services, in particular, \"Know Your Customer\" and personal financial information. Laws in this area, such as POPI and GDPR, have been passed by several jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. The interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nThe Protection of Personal Information Act, or POPI, took effect on July 1, 2020, in South Africa. POPI requires that all forms of processing of personal information must, within one year after the commencement thereof, conform to the conditions of lawful processing set out in POPI. We are required to comply with the conditions contained in POPI by June 30, 2021. Contravention of POPI could result in (a) the imposition of fines by the Information Regulator; (b) imprisonment for a period of between 12 months to ten years of any person who hinders, obstructs or unlawfully influences the Information Regulator; or who is a responsible party, as defined under POPI, and commits unlawful acts; (c) and/or a damages claim instituted by the data subject(s). In addition, the Information Officer (which is an automatic position held by the chief executive officer, managing director or head of the organization) may be held criminally liable. An Information Officer is required to be registered with the Information Regulator.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect on May 25, 2018, in the European Union as well as the European Economic Area and introduced direct compliance obligations for data controllers and data processors. National Data Protection Agencies, or NDPAs, are now able to impose fines for violations ranging from 2% to 4% of annual worldwide turnover, or 10 million to 20 million euro, whichever is greater. NDPAs have the power to carry out audits, request information, and obtain access to premises. Businesses must be able to demonstrate that the personal data of any data subject can be lawfully processed on one of the six specified grounds.\nComplying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any regulatory requirements or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, as noted above, we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.\nAmendments to the NCA were signed into law in South Africa in August 2019. Compliance with these amendments may adversely impact our micro-lending operations in South Africa.\nIn August 2019, the National Credit Amendment Bill, or debt-relief bill, was signed into law in South Africa. The effective date of the debt-relief bill has not yet been announced. We believe that the debt-relief bill will restrict the ability of financial services providers to provide lending products to certain low-income earners and will increase the cost of credit to these consumers. As a result, compliance with the debt-relief bill may adversely impact our micro-lending operations in South Africa.\nThe debt-relief bill is a debt-relief intervention that forms part of an amendment to the NCA and is intended to assist over-indebted individuals who earn less than a prescribed monthly minimum, currently ZAR 7,500, and have unsecured debt of no more than ZAR 50,000. Individuals that have not commenced a debt counseling process, have not been sequestrated and are not subject to an administration order may seek debt relief under the debt-relief bill. Applications for debt relief are expected to be processed by the NCR and will then be submitted to the National Consumer Tribunal, or NCT.\nThe NCR will first assess whether an applicant can meet its debt obligations by paying a lower installment over an extended period of no more than five years, a so-called debt re-arrangement. This process is similar to the debt counseling provisions in existing legislation, except the applicant would not pay for the debt counselor and therefore does not enjoy the services of the counselor. If the applicant has no income, the NCR will recommend that the applicant's debts be suspended for 24 months in the hopes that the applicant's circumstances improve in order to service the debt over time.\nDuring this period, interest and fees under the debt arrangement will cease and the applicant is required to attend a financial literacy program provided by the NCR. If the applicant's circumstances improve during this period, and the applicant is able to meet its debt obligations, the NCR will recommend a debt re-arrangement to the NCT. If the applicant's circumstances do not improve after 24 months, the NCR will apply to the NCT for the debt to be written off.\nA credit provider may not enforce any rights under a credit agreement if the associated debt is written off. All or part of a credit agreement will be deemed reckless under the NCA if a credit provider enters into a credit agreement (other than a consolidated loan) with an applicant while under debt relief. An applicant furnishing false information when applying for debt relief may be fined or imprisoned for not longer than two years, or both, and is permanently prohibited from applying for debt relief.\nWe expect that it will take us, and other financial services providers, some time to fully understand, interpret and implement this new legislation in our lending processes and practices. Non-compliance with the provisions of this new legislation may result in financial loss and penalties, reputational loss or other administrative punishment.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nWe are an operating company whose business is focused on developing and offering payment solutions, transaction processing services and financial technologies across multiple industries and in a number of emerging and developed economies, directly and through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as through strategic partnering arrangements with companies. In such circumstances, we typically acquire a minority interest in an operating company in which a strategic partner also has an interest. While the relevant strategic partner may have primary responsibility for, among other things, the day-to-day business operations of the relevant strategic partnership, we typically retain certain elements of control, such as the ability to vote for or appoint members to the board (or equivalent) of such strategic partnerships, our input into management of those partnerships, and/or major decision rights with respect to operations.\nOur conduct, public filings and announcements hold us out as such an operating company and do not hold us out as being engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Nevertheless, certain of our strategic partnering arrangements may be deemed to be \u201cinvestment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 3(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act. These holdings have had and continue to have uncertain and fluctuating values which could cause us to be deemed to be an investment company within the meaning of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act if their values are determined to exceed 40 percent of the value of our total assets (exclusive of government securities, cash and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis unless another exception or exemption applies. In addition, during the last several months, our cash balances have meaningfully increased as a proportion of our total assets as we completed the planned disposition of some our wholly-owned subsidiaries and our interest in one of our strategic partners, Also, and in light of recent economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we cancelled our option to acquire an additional interest in Bank Frick which would have resulted in us increasing our equity holding in Bank Frick from 35% to 70%. We have not yet redeployed this cash into our operating businesses.\nRegardless of the value of our strategic partnering arrangements at any particular time, we believe we should be viewed as primarily engaged in a business other than investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. In order to resolve our status more formally, we are in the process of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission an application pursuant to Section 3(b)(2) of the Investment Company Act for an order declaring that we are not an investment company as defined in the Investment Company Act.\nIf we are deemed an investment company and not entitled to an exception or exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we would have to register as an investment company, modify our equity interests or otherwise change our business so that it falls outside the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If the Securities and Exchange Commission does not grant us the order, compliance with the Investment Company Act would limit our ability to continue our strategic partnering arrangements and may require us to significantly restructure our business plan, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Registering as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act could, among other things, materially limit our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions and otherwise would subject us to substantial and costly regulation. Failure to register, if required, would significantly impair our ability to continue to engage in our business and would have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has experienced recent significant volatility. During the 2020 fiscal year, our stock price ranged from a low of $2.70 to a high of $4.45. We expect that the trading price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022 any adverse developments in litigation or regulatory actions in which we are involved;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar/ZAR exchange rate;\n\u2022 announcement of additional BEE transactions, especially one involving the issuance or potential issuance of equity securities or dilution or sale of our existing business in South Africa;\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our operating results, especially if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 significant fair value adjustments in respect of investments;\n\u2022 significant impairment of investments;\n\u2022 announcements of acquisitions, disposals or impairments of intangible assets;\n\u2022 the timing of or delays in the commencement, implementation or completion of investments or major projects;\n\u2022 large purchases or sales of our common stock;\n\u2022 general conditions in the markets in which we operate; and\n\u2022 economic and financial conditions.\nThe put right we have agreed to grant to the IFC Investors on the occurrence of certain triggering events may have adverse impacts on us.\nIn May 2016, we issued an aggregate of 9,984,311 shares of our common stock to the IFC Investors, of which, as of June 30, 2020, the IFC Investors held 7,881,142 shares. We granted the IFC Investors certain rights, including the right to require us to repurchase any share held by the IFC Investors pursuant to the May 2016 transaction upon the occurrence of specified triggering events, which we refer to as a \"put right.\" Events triggering the put right relate to (1) us being the subject of a governmental complaint alleging, a court judgment finding or an indictment alleging that we (a) engaged in specified corrupt, fraudulent, coercive, collusive or obstructive practices; (b) entered into transactions with targets of economic sanctions; or (c) failed to operate our business in compliance with anti-money laundering or anti-terrorism laws; or (2) our rejection of a bona fide offer to acquire all of our outstanding shares at a time when we have in place or implement a shareholder rights plan, or adopt a shareholder rights plan triggered by a beneficial ownership threshold of less than twenty percent. The put price per share will be the higher of the price per share paid to us by the IFC Investors and the volume-weighted average price per share prevailing for the 60 trading days preceding the triggering event, except that with respect to a put right triggered by rejection of a bona fide offer, the put price per share will be the highest price offered by the offeror. If a put triggering event occurs, it could adversely impact our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, the existence of the put right could also affect whether or on what terms a third party might in the future offer to purchase our company. Our response to any such offer could also be complicated, delayed or otherwise influenced by the existence of the put right.\nApproximately 30% of our outstanding common stock is owned by two shareholders. The interests of these shareholders may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nThere is a concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock because approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock is owned by two shareholders. Based on their most recent SEC filings disclosing ownership of our shares, Value Capital Partners (Pty) Ltd, or VCP, and IFC Investors, beneficially own approximately 16% and 14% of our outstanding common stock, respectively.\nVCP has agreed, pursuant to a Cooperation Agreement dated May 13, 2020, to refrain from acquiring more than 19.9% of our outstanding common stock or taking certain actions, including acting in concert with others, that could result in a change of control of the Company. These restrictions remain in effect through the date of our 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.\nThe interests of VCP and the IFC Investors may be different from or conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. As a result of the significant combined ownership by VCP and the IFC Investors, subject to the limitations applicable to VCP contained in the Cooperation Agreement, they will be able, if they act together, to significantly influence the voting outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, thus depriving shareholders of a premium for their shares, or facilitating a change of control that other shareholders may oppose.\nWe may seek to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock.\nWe may require additional financing to fund future operations, including expansion in current and new markets, programming development and acquisition, capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies, or to fund acquisitions. Because of the exposure to market risks associated with economies in emerging markets, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price and voting power of shares of common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us.\nWe may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations or acquisitions as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock.\nIn recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control. If our business development plans are successful, we may require additional financing to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies, to expand into new markets and to make acquisitions, all of which may be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means.\nIssuances of significant amounts of stock in the future could potentially dilute your equity ownership and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our common stock in order to provide us with the flexibility to issue shares for business purposes that may arise from time to time. For example, we could sell additional shares to raise capital to fund our operations or to acquire other businesses, issue shares in a BEE transaction, issue additional shares under our stock incentive plan or declare a stock dividend. Our board may authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock without notice to, or further action by, our shareholders, unless shareholder approval is required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The issuance of additional shares could dilute the equity ownership of our current shareholders. In addition, additional shares that we issue would likely be freely tradable which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes, we are required to furnish a management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a \"material weakness\" or changes in internal control that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. A \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe requirement to evaluate and report on our internal control also applies to companies that we acquire. Some of these companies may not be required to comply with Sarbanes prior to the time we acquire them. The integration of these acquired companies into our internal control over financial reporting could require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs. If we fail to successfully integrate the operations of these acquired companies into our internal control over financial reporting, our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting where the control over the review of the accounting for non-routine complex transactions did not operate effectively. As a result, the control did not operate effectively in determining the correct classification in the statement of operations of the $34.0 million accrual for the implementation costs to be refunded to SASSA following the September 30, 2019 Supreme Court ruling. During the current fiscal year, we have implemented additional controls to address this matter, but have had insufficient instances of non-routine complex transactions to be able to assess whether these additional controls are operating effectively. Accordingly, the material weakness remains unremediated as of June 30, 2020.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2020, due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described above.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent potential future material weaknesses. While we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market's perception of our business and our stock price.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions based upon U.S. laws, including federal securities laws or other foreign laws, against us or certain of our directors and officers and experts.\nWhile Net1 is incorporated in the state of Florida, United States, the company is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa and substantially all of the company's assets are located outside the United States. In addition, the majority of Net1's directors and all its officers reside outside of the United States and the majority of our experts, including our independent registered public accountants, are based in South Africa.\nAs a result, even though you could effect service of legal process upon Net1, as a Florida corporation, in the United States, you may not be able to collect any judgment obtained against Net1 in the United States, including any judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws, because substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. Moreover, it may not be possible for you to effect service of legal process upon the majority of our directors and officers or upon our experts within the United States or elsewhere outside South Africa and any judgment obtained against any of our foreign directors, officers and experts in the United States, including one based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by a South African court.\nSouth Africa is not a party to any treaties regarding the enforcement of foreign commercial judgments, as opposed to foreign arbitral awards. Accordingly, a foreign judgment is not directly enforceable in South Africa, but constitutes a cause of action which may be enforced by South African courts provided that:\n\u2022 the court which pronounced the judgment had international jurisdiction and competence to entertain the case according to the principles recognized by South African law with reference to the jurisdiction of foreign courts;\n\u2022 the judgment is final and conclusive (that is, it cannot be altered by the court which pronounced it);\n\u2022 the judgment has not lapsed;\n\u2022 the recognition and enforcement of the judgment by South African courts would not be contrary to public policy in South Africa, including observance of the rules of natural justice which require that no award is enforceable unless the defendant was duly served with documents initiating proceedings, that he was given a fair opportunity to be heard and that he enjoyed the right to be legally represented in a free and fair trial before an impartial tribunal;\n\u2022 the judgment was not obtained by improper or fraudulent means;\n\u2022 the judgment does not involve the enforcement of a penal or foreign revenue law or any award of multiple or punitive damages; and\n\u2022 the enforcement of the judgment is not otherwise precluded by the provisions of the Protection of Business Act 99 of 1978 (as amended), of the Republic of South Africa.\nIt has been the policy of South African courts to award compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained by the person to whom the compensation is awarded. South African courts have awarded compensation to shareholders who have suffered damages as a result of a diminution in the value of their shares based on various actions by the corporation and its management. Although the award of punitive damages is generally unknown to the South African legal system, that does not mean that such awards are necessarily contrary to public policy.\nWhether a judgment was contrary to public policy depends on the facts of each case. Exorbitant, unconscionable, or excessive awards will generally be contrary to public policy. South African courts cannot enter into the merits of a foreign judgment and cannot act as a court of appeal or review over the foreign court. Further, if a foreign judgment is enforced by a South African court, it will be payable in South African currency. Also, under South Africa's exchange control laws, the approval of SARB is required before a defendant resident in South Africa may pay money to a non-resident plaintiff in satisfaction of a foreign judgment enforced by a court in South Africa.\nIt is doubtful whether an original action based on United States federal securities laws may be brought before South African courts. A plaintiff who is not resident in South Africa may be required to provide security for costs in the event of proceedings being initiated in South Africa. Furthermore, the Rules of the High Court of South Africa require that documents executed outside South Africa must be authenticated for the purpose of use in South African courts. In reaching the foregoing conclusions in respect of South Africa, we consulted with our South African legal counsel, Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr Inc.", "PERMNO": 90875, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "UEPS"}
