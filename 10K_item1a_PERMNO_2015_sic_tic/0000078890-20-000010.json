RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in highly competitive industries.\nWe compete in industries that are subject to significant competition and pricing pressures in most markets. In addition, our business model requires significant fixed costs associated with offering many of our services including costs to operate a fleet of armored vehicles and a network of secure branches. Because we believe we have competitive advantages such as brand name recognition and a reputation for a high level of service and security, we resist competing on price alone. However, continued pricing pressure from competitors or failure to achieve pricing based on the competitive advantages identified above could result in lost volume of business and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, given the highly competitive nature of our industries, it is important to develop new solutions and product and service offerings to help retain and expand our customer base. Failure to develop, sell and execute new solutions and offerings in a timely and efficient manner could also negatively affect our ability to retain our existing customer base or pricing structure and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDecreased use of cash could have a negative impact on our business.\nWhile cash remains the most popular form of consumer payment in the U.S. and globally, the growth of payment options other than cash could reduce the need for services related to cash, thereby affecting our financial results. We are developing new services that offer current and prospective customers with opportunities to streamline their cash processing costs, making cash more competitive with other forms of payment. There is a risk that these initiatives may not offset the risks associated with our traditional cash-based business and that our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nOur strategy may not be successful.\nOur strategy has three pillars: accelerate profitable growth, close the gap with competitors and introduce differentiated services. We may not be successful in growing revenue in high-margin lines of business, increasing our market share with existing customers or winning new business with smaller financial institutions and the retail market. Although we are improving productivity and optimizing costs, we may not be able to achieve industry-leading margins. We also may not be successful in strengthening and leveraging our IT capabilities to improve service levels and drive efficiencies. If we are unable to achieve our strategic objectives and anticipated operating profit improvements, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe have significant operations outside the United States.\nWe currently serve customers in more than 100 countries, including 41 countries where we operate subsidiaries. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of our revenues in 2019 came from operations outside the U.S. We expect revenues outside the U.S. to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues. Business operations outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries, such as:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nenforcement of our global compliance program in foreign countries with a variety of laws, cultures and customs;\n\u2022\nvarying permitting and licensing requirements in different jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nforeign ownership laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nthreat of nationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022\nhigher costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nlaws or other requirements and restrictions associated with organized labor;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in equity, revenues and profits due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including measures taken by governments to devalue official currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ninflation levels exceeding that of the U.S; and\n\u2022\ninability to collect for services provided to government entities.\nWe are exposed to certain risks when we operate in countries that have high levels of inflation, including the risk that:\n\u2022\nthe rate of price increases for services will not keep pace with the cost of inflation;\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions may discourage business growth which could affect demand for our services;\n\u2022\nthe devaluation of the currency may exceed the rate of inflation and reported U.S. dollar revenues and profits may decline; and\n\u2022\nthese countries may be deemed \u201chighly inflationary\u201d for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) purposes.\nWe manage these risks by monitoring current and anticipated political and economic developments, monitoring adherence to our global compliance program and adjusting operations as appropriate. Changes in the political or economic environments of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business success depends on retaining our leadership team and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continuing services and contributions of our leadership team to execute on our strategic plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Our future success also depends, in part, on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Any turnover in senior management or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Turnover in key leadership positions within the Company may adversely affect our ability to manage the company efficiently and effectively, could be disruptive and distracting to management and may lead to additional departures of current personnel, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, our initiatives to drive efficiency and control costs.\nWe have launched a number of initiatives, including the reorganization and restructuring actions described on page 6, to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs. Although we have achieved annual cost savings associated with these initiatives, we may be unable to sustain the cost savings that we have achieved. In addition, if we are unable to achieve, or have any unexpected delays in achieving additional cost savings, our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected. Even if we meet our goals as a result of these initiatives, we may not receive the expected financial benefits of these initiatives.\nWe may not be successful in pursuing strategic investments or acquisitions or realize the expected benefits of those transactions because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nWhile we may identify opportunities for acquisitions and investments to support our growth strategy, as well as divestiture opportunities, our due diligence examinations and positions that we may take with respect to appropriate valuations for acquisitions and divestitures and other transaction terms and conditions may hinder our ability to successfully complete business transactions to achieve our strategic goals. We compete with others within our industry for suitable acquisition candidates. This competition may increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of acquisition candidates available to us. As a result, our ability to acquire businesses in the future, and to acquire such businesses on favorable terms, may be limited. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions will depend, in part, on successfully integrating each business with our company as well as improving operating performance and profitability through our management efforts and capital investments. The risks to a successful integration and improvement of operating performance and profitability include, among others, failure to implement our business plan, unanticipated issues in integrating operations with ours, unanticipated changes in laws and regulations, labor unrest resulting from union operations, regulatory, environmental and permitting issues, unfavorable customer reactions, the effect on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and difficulties in fully identifying and evaluating potential liabilities, risks and operating issues. In order to finance such acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional funds either through public or private financings, including bank and other secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financings would be available to us on reasonable terms or that any future issuances of securities in connection with acquisitions will not be dilutive to our shareholders. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our expected benefits of any acquisitions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets in the United States that may not be realized.\nDeferred tax assets are future tax deductions that result primarily from the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. At December 31, 2019, we had $209 million of U.S. deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, primarily related to our retirement plan obligations. These future tax deductions may not be realized if tax rules change in the future, or if forecasted U.S. operational results or any other U.S. projected future taxable income is insufficient. Consequently, not realizing our U.S. deferred tax assets may significantly and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIt is possible that we will incur restructuring charges in the future.\nIt is possible that we will take restructuring actions, including in connection with acquisitions, in one or more of our markets in the future to reduce expenses. These actions could result in significant restructuring charges at these subsidiaries, including recognizing impairment charges to write down assets and recording accruals for employee severance. These charges, if required, could significantly and materially affect results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant retirement obligations. Poor investment performance of retirement plan holdings and / or lower interest rates used to discount the obligations could unfavorably affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have substantial pension and retiree medical obligations, a portion of which have been funded. The amount of these obligations is significantly affected by factors that are not in our control, including interest rates used to determine the present value of future payment streams, investment returns, medical inflation rates, participation rates and changes in laws and regulations. The funded status of the primary U.S. pension plan was approximately 86% as of December 31, 2019. Based on our actuarial assumptions at the end of 2019, we do not expect to make contributions until 2022. A change in assumptions could result in funding obligations that could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to use our resources to make acquisitions and to otherwise grow our business.\nWe have $676 million of actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the end of 2019. These losses relate to changes in actuarial assumptions that have increased the net liability for benefit plans. These losses have not been recognized in earnings. These losses will be recognized in earnings in future periods to the extent they are not offset by future actuarial gains. Our projections of future cash requirements and expenses for these plans could be adversely affected if our retirement plans have additional actuarial losses.\nOur earnings and cash flow could be materially affected by increased losses of customer valuables.\nWe purchase insurance coverage for losses of customer valuables for amounts in excess of what we consider prudent deductibles and/or retentions. Insurance is provided by different groups of underwriters at negotiated rates and terms. Coverage is available to us in major insurance markets, although premiums charged are subject to fluctuations depending on market conditions. Our loss experience and that of other companies in our industry affects premium rates. We are not insured for losses below our coverage limits and recognize expense up to these limits for actual losses. Our insurance policies cover losses from most causes, with the exception of war, nuclear risk and various other exclusions typical for such policies. The availability of high-quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in obtaining and retaining customers and managing the risks of our business. If our losses increase, or if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks associated with information technology can expose Brink\u2019s to business disruptions, cybersecurity breaches and regulatory violations.\nWe rely on our information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure. If there were to be significant problems with our infrastructure, such as IT datacenter or system failure, or failure to develop new technology platforms to support new initiatives and product and service offerings, it could halt or delay our ability to service our customers, hinder our ability to conduct and expand our business and require significant remediation costs. Our data security risks will increase as we employ emerging technologies, mobile applications, third-party service providers and cloud-based services. If any of these risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, in the normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential information. Hacking, phishing attacks, ransomware, insider threats, physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to Brink\u2019s, its employees or customers to be misused. If risks such as these materialize, we may incur significant challenges and costs related to coordination with third-party service providers in order to resolve related issues. If our third-party providers do not respond in a timely manner to our needs, disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management activities could be negatively impacted. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain and respond to cybersecurity breaches and that provide employee awareness training regarding cyber risks; however, due to evolving and advanced sophisticated attack vectors, cyber attacks remain increasingly difficult to detect and we may not be able to successfully defend against them. Any cybersecurity breach, whether by us or by third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a global company we must adhere to applicable laws and regulations in numerous regions regarding data privacy, data protection, and data security. Privacy and data protection laws vary between countries and are subject to interpretation, which may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and became effective in May 2018. GDPR imposes requirements related to the handling of personal data, mandates public disclosure of significant data breaches, and provides for substantial penalties for non-compliance. Our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNegative publicity to our name or brand could lead to a loss of revenues or profitability.\nWe are in the security business and our success and longevity are based to a large extent on our reputation for trust and integrity. Our reputation or brand, particularly the trust placed in us by our customers, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual breaches in our ability to conduct our business ethically, securely and responsibly. In addition, we have licensing arrangements that permit certain entities to use Brink\u2019s name and/or other intellectual property in connection with their businesses. If any of these entities experienced an actual or perceived breach in its ability to conduct its business ethically, securely or responsibly, it could have a negative effect on our name and/or brand. Any damage to our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in regulated industries.\nOur U.S. operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation with respect to safety of operations and equipment and financial responsibility. Intrastate operations in the U.S. are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities and interprovincial operations in Canada are subject to regulation by Canadian and provincial regulatory authorities. Our other international operations are regulated to varying degrees by the countries in which we operate. Many countries have permit requirements for security services and prohibit foreign companies from providing different types of security services.\nChanges in laws or regulations could require a change in the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations were to change or we failed to comply, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur inability to access capital or significant increases in our cost of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing depends on our credit quality as well as the liquidity of financial markets. A negative change in our ratings outlook or any downgrade in our credit ratings by the rating agencies could adversely affect our cost and/or access to sources of liquidity and capital. Additionally, such a downgrade could increase the costs of borrowing under available credit lines. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to access short-term and long-term capital. Our access to funds under current credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the participating banks to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. Longer disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to capital needed for our business.\nWe are subject to covenants for our credit facilities and our unsecured notes.\nOur senior secured credit facility, senior unsecured notes, letter of credit facilities and bank guarantee facilities contain various financial and other covenants. The financial covenants include a limit on the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a limit on the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense. Other covenants, among other things, limit our ability to provide liens, restrict fundamental changes, limit transactions with affiliates and unrestricted subsidiaries, restrict changes to our fiscal year and to organization documents, limit asset dispositions, limit the use of proceeds from asset sales, limit sale and leaseback transactions, limit investments, limit the ability to incur debt, restrict certain payments to shareholders, limit negative pledges and limit the ability to change the nature of our business. Although we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to operations, the ability to meet financial and other covenants can be affected by changes in our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that we will meet these covenants. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under existing credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities, the lenders could cause amounts outstanding to be immediately payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. The occurrence of these events would have a significant effect on our liquidity and cash flows.\nOur effective income tax rate could change.\nWe operate subsidiaries in 41 countries, all of which have different income tax laws and associated income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate can be significantly affected by changes in the mix of pretax earnings by country and the related income tax rates in those countries. In addition, our effective income tax rate is significantly affected by the ability to realize deferred tax assets, including those associated with net operating losses. Changes in income tax laws, income apportionment, or estimates of the ability to realize deferred tax assets, could significantly affect our effective income tax rate, financial position and results of operations. We are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have certain environmental and other exposures related to our former coal operations.\nWe may incur future environmental and other liabilities in connection with our former coal operations, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\nGrowing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we are subject. Some form of federal regulation may be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or \"cap and trade\" legislation. The outcome of this legislation may result in new regulation, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions. Compliance with these actions could result in the creation of additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased fuel prices or additional taxes or emission allowances. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations from our customers, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the potential effects of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect our operations.\nThe Company could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist or hostile stockholders.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing among publicly traded companies. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors, potentially hindering the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plan and negatively affecting the trading value of our common stock. Additionally, shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s future direction, adversely affect its relationships with key executives, customers and other business partners, or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, the\nCompany has been, and may in the future be, required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect the Company and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains both historical and forward-looking information.
