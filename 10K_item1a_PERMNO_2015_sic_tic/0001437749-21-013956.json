{"cik": "880807", "company": "AMERICAN SUPERCONDUCTOR CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance\nWe have a history of operating losses, which may continue in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may fall below expectations in any particular fiscal quarter.\nWe were not profitable in fiscal 2020 and have recorded net losses in two of the last three fiscal years. While we did report net income of $26.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, it was largely as a result of the receipt of payments from Sinovel Wind Group Co. Ltd. pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement described further herein. We may not be profitable in fiscal 2021 or future years.\nThere is currently substantial uncertainty in our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. In addition, our operating results historically have been difficult to predict and have at times fluctuated from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result of all of these factors, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. In addition, we have in the past, and may continue to, provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and statements. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts that follow our company in any period or we do not meet our guidance, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline.\nOur operating expenses do not always vary directly with revenue and may be difficult to adjust in the short term. As a result, if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations, we may not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter, and therefore such a revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our operating results for that quarter.\nWe have a history of negative operating cash flows, and we may require additional financing in the future, which may not be available to us.\nAs of March 31, 2021, we had approximately $80.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash, and during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we used $8.7 million in cash for our operating activities. We have historically experienced net losses, although we did report net income of $26.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. We plan to continue to closely monitor our expenses and, if required, will further reduce operating costs and capital spending to enhance liquidity.\nOur liquidity is highly dependent on our ability to profitably grow our revenues, control our operating costs, and secure additional financing, if required. We may require additional capital to conduct our business and adequately respond to future business challenges or opportunities, including, but not limited to, the need to develop new products or enhance existing products, maintain or expand research and development projects, collateralize performance bonds or letters of credit, and the need to build inventory or to invest other cash to support business growth. In order to raise additional capital, we may offer shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of each of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders.\nIn the event that additional liquidity is required, there can be no assurance that such financing would be available or, if available, that such financing could be obtained upon terms acceptable to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may be required to issue performance bonds or provide letters of credit, which restricts our ability to access any cash used as collateral for the bonds or letters of credit.\nWhile we have been required to provide performance bonds in the form of surety bonds or other forms of security and letters of credit in the past, the size of the bonds and letters of credit was not material. In recent years, we have entered into contracts that require us to post bonds and to deliver letters of credit of significant magnitude. For example, as part of the agreement with Commonwealth Edison Company (\u201cComEd\u201d) to install the Resilient Electric Grid (\u201cREG\u201d) system in Chicago, we delivered an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $5.0 million to secure certain of our obligations under the Subcontract Agreement and deposited $5.0 million in an escrow account as collateral to secure such letter of credit. Similarly, in many other instances, we have been required to deposit cash in escrow accounts as collateral for these instruments, which is unavailable to us for general use for significant periods of time. Should we be unable to obtain performance bonds or letters of credit in the future, significant future potential revenue could become unavailable to us. Further, should our working capital situation deteriorate, we would not be able to access the restricted cash to meet working capital requirements.\nChanges in exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations, and we could experience losses with respect to hedging activities. In fiscal 2020, 41% of our revenues were recognized from sales outside of the United States. In addition, approximately 17% of our revenues in fiscal 2020 were derived under sales contracts where prices were denominated in the Euro. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in a lesser number of orders, and therefore lower revenues, from such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold, and the currency they receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and may lead investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial data.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. In the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we identified that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed, relating to our failure to maintain proper controls, processes and procedures over the initial purchase accounting and the continuing fair value accounting associated with the acquisition of Northeast Power Systems, Inc. (\u201cNEPSI\u201d) and related assets (the \u201cNEPSI Acquisition\u201d) that were adequately designed, documented and executed to support the accurate and timely reporting of our financial results. Specifically, the modeling assumptions and the calculation performed by our third-party valuation specialist as it relates to fair value accounting for contingent consideration on the purchase accounting for the NEPSI Acquisition included errors resulting in a $1.3 million overstatement in both the fair value of the earnout payment and the preliminary estimated purchase price paid to NEPSI that we failed to detect, which were reflected in Exhibit 99.3 of our Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on December 14, 2020. Subsequently, we made post-closing adjustments necessary to properly reflect the fair value of the contingent consideration liability in the financial statements.\nOur management, with the oversight of our audit committee, took additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weakness, which included the development and implementation of new procedures, policies, and processes, including revising precision level of management review controls and gaining additional assurance regarding timely completion of our outside service providers\u2019 quality control procedures. Although the material weakness was remediated during the quarter ended March 31, 2021, if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations or comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common stock, or an investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by our disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our business. Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may not realize all of the sales expected from our backlog of orders and contracts.\nWe cannot assure you that we will realize the revenue we expect to generate from our backlog in the periods we expect to realize such revenue, or at all.\nIn addition, the backlog of orders, if realized, may not result in profitable revenue. Backlog represents the value of contracts and purchase orders received for which delivery is expected in the next twelve months. Our customers have the right under some circumstances and with some penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. In addition, our government contracts are subject to the risks described below. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected, and we may not generate the revenue we expect.\nAlthough we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that they may cancel orders or reschedule orders due to fluctuations in their business needs or purchasing budgets.\nThis has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our ability to grow our revenues. In addition, current and future suppliers may be less likely to grant us credit, resulting in a negative impact on our working capital and cash flows.\nOur contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audit, modification or termination by the U.S. government and include certain other provisions in favor of the government. The continued funding of such contracts remains subject to annual congressional appropriation, which, if not approved, could reduce our revenue and lower or eliminate our profit.\nAs a company that contracts with the U.S. government, we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the U.S. government of our costs and performance, accounting, and general business practices relating to these contracts. Based on the results of these audits, the U.S. government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees. We cannot be certain that adjustments arising from government audits and reviews would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur U.S. government contracts customarily contain other provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the government to:\n\u2022\nobtain certain rights to the intellectual property that we develop under the contract;\n\u2022\ndecline to award future contracts if actual or apparent organizational conflicts of interest are discovered, or to impose organizational conflict mitigation measures as a condition of eligibility for an award;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar us from doing business with the government or a specific government agency; and\n\u2022\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions unique to government contracting.\nAll of our U.S. government contracts, as well as certain of our contracts with third parties that are dependent on U.S. government contracts, can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience, including our contract with the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) to deploy our REG system in ComEd\u2019s electric grid in Chicago, Illinois (\u201cProject REG\u201d). Termination-for-convenience provisions typically provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, and for settlement of expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the right of the U.S. government to terminate its contracts with us, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by the U.S. Congress of the necessary spending to honor such contracts. Congress often appropriates funds for a program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of many major governmental programs, contracts often may not be fully funded, and additional monies are then committed to the contract only if, as and when appropriations are made by the U.S. Congress for future fiscal years. In addition, government shutdowns could prevent or delay such contracts from being funded.\nWe cannot be certain that our U.S. government contracts, including our contract for Project REG, or our contracts with third parties that relate to projects for the U.S. government will not be terminated or suspended in the future. The U.S. government\u2019s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of our contracts would have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. Further, in the event that any of our government contracts are terminated for cause, it could affect our ability to obtain future government contracts which could, in turn, seriously harm our ability to develop our technologies and products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince March 2020, COVID-19 has spread throughout the globe, including in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where our headquarters are located, and in other areas where we have business operations. In response to the outbreak, we have followed the guidelines of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") and applicable state government authorities to protect the health and safety of our employees, their families, our suppliers, our customers and our communities. While these existing measures, and COVID-19 generally, have not materially disrupted our business to date, any future actions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in disruption to our business.\nOur suppliers may become adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we could face delays or difficulty sourcing products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products, they may cost more, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.\nInox\u2019s ability to perform under the supply contract has been and may continue to be hampered by the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our other customers may become adversely impacted by the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the deterioration in economic conditions, our customers and potential customers may reduce demand for our products, decrease their spending or reconsider orders, all of which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, the location, duration and magnitude of future waves of infection, new mutations of the virus, timing, effectiveness and adoption of vaccines, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, the duration and extent of business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease. If we, our customers or suppliers experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock are likely to be materially adversely affected, and our ability to access the capital markets may be limited.\nChanges in U.S. Government Defense Spending Could Negatively Impact Our Financial Position, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business.\nWe have several contracts with the U.S. government, including defense-related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense. Changes in U.S. government defense spending for various reasons, including as a result of potential changes in policy positions or priorities that may result from the recent U.S. presidential and congressional election, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our programs are subject to U.S. government policies, budget decisions and appropriation processes which are driven by numerous factors including: (1) geopolitical events; (2) macroeconomic conditions; and (3) the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. In prior years, the U.S. government has been unable to timely complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in governmental shut-downs or providing only enough funds for U.S. government agencies to continue operating at prior-year levels. Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe rely upon third-party suppliers for the components and subassemblies of many of our Grid and Wind products, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nMany of our components and subassemblies are currently manufactured for us by a limited number of qualified suppliers. Any interruption in the supply of components or subassemblies, or our inability to obtain substitute components or subassemblies from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn order to minimize costs and time to market, we have and will continue to identify local suppliers that meet our quality standards to produce certain of our subassemblies and components. These efforts may not be successful. In addition, any event which negatively impacts our supply, including, among others, wars, terrorist activities, natural disasters and outbreaks of infectious disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products. Our revenues from the affected products would decline or we could incur losses until such time as we are able to restore our production processes or put in place alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers. Even though we carry business interruption insurance policies, we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies.\nUncertainty surrounding our prospects and financial condition may have an adverse effect on our customer and supplier relationships.\nOur relationships with our customers and suppliers are predicated on the belief that we will continue to operate. Our customers, particularly in the utility industry, are generally risk averse and may not enter into sales contracts with us if there is uncertainty regarding our ability to support working capital needs of large-scale projects.\nWe may experience difficulties re-establishing our HTS wire production capability in our Ayer, Massachusetts facility.\nAs part of our effort to increase manufacturing efficiency, we moved from our former manufacturing facility located in Devens, Massachusetts to our smaller-scale leased facility located in Ayer, Massachusetts. Moving our HTS wire manufacturing operations to a different plant involves various risks, including the inability to commence HTS wire manufacturing within the cost and time frame estimated and the inability to produce a high-quality product with an acceptable yield and cost. Failure to successfully commence the manufacturing of our HTS wire due to these and other unforeseen risks could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could adversely impact our operating and financial results.\nOur success is dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so could significantly damage our business and prospects.\nWe have attracted a highly skilled management team and specialized workforce, including scientists, engineers, researchers, manufacturing, personnel, and marketing and sales professionals. Hiring and retaining good personnel for our business is challenging, and highly qualified technical personnel are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy. In addition, we may need to provide higher compensation or more training to our personnel than we currently anticipate. Moreover, any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. Losing the services of any of our executive officers or key employees could materially and adversely impact our business.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our revenues have been derived from a single customer. If this customer\u2019s business is negatively affected, it could adversely impact our business.\nRevenues from Inox are supported by a supply contract to purchase, and a license to make, use and supply, wind turbine ECS. Inox has been active in the new central and state government auction regime in India and has over 1,350 MW of orders from the first four Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (\u201cSECI\u201d) central government auctions, and 50 MW from the Maharashtra state government auction. However, we cannot predict if and how successful Inox will be in executing on these orders or in obtaining new orders under the new central and state auction regime. In addition, Inox\u2019s ability to perform under the supply contract has been and may continue to be hampered by the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, India\u2019s manufacturing facilities have been closed at the direction of India\u2019s government and are expected to remain closed for so long as the impacted regions remain highly affected by COVID-19. Any failure by Inox to succeed under this regime, or any delay in Inox\u2019s ability to deliver its wind turbines, could result in fewer ECS shipments to Inox. Inox has historically failed to post letters of credit and take delivery of forecasted ECS quantities. If Inox again fails to post letters of credit and take delivery of forecasted ECS quantities, cancels, does not otherwise fully perform under the supply contract or discontinues future purchases from us under the supply contract, then our business, operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nOur success in addressing the wind energy market is dependent on the manufacturers that license our designs.\nBecause an important element of our strategy for addressing the wind energy market involves the license of our wind turbine designs to manufacturers of those systems, the financial benefits to us from our products for the wind energy market are dependent on the success of these manufacturers in selling wind turbines based on our designs. We may not be able to enter into marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties on financially acceptable terms, or at all, and third parties may not be successful in selling our products or applications incorporating our products.\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or security breach of our information technology infrastructure.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Any failure to manage, expand, and update our information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business. In addition, the costs associated with updating and securing our information technology infrastructure are likely to increase as such security measures become more complex, which may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other similar disruptions. Our business is also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees. Our business activities in China may increase our risks to such breaches. Any system failure, accident, or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could harm our reputation, result in substantial remediation costs, lead to lost revenues and litigation, increase our insurance premiums and have other adverse effects on our business.\nFailure to comply with evolving data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to many rapidly evolving privacy and data protection laws and regulations in Europe and around the world. This requires us to operate in a complex environment where there are significant constraints on how we can process personal data across our business. The European General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, has established stringent data protection requirements for companies doing business in or handling personal data of individuals in the European Union. The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and processors including the requirement to maintain a record of their data processing and to implement policies and procedures as part of their mandated privacy governance framework. Breaches of the GDPR could result in substantial fines, which in some cases could be up to four percent of our worldwide revenue. In addition, a breach of the GDPR or other data privacy or data protection laws or regulations could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well potential civil claims including class action type litigation. There is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm if we fail to properly process or protect the data or privacy of third parties or comply with the GDPR, CCPA or other applicable data privacy and data protection regimes.\nMany of our revenue opportunities are dependent upon subcontractors and other business collaborators.\nMany of the revenue opportunities for our business involve projects, such as the installation of superconductor cables in power grids and electrical system hardware in wind turbines, in which we collaborate with other companies, including suppliers of cryogenic systems, manufacturers of electric power cables and manufacturers of wind turbines. As a result, most of our current and planned revenue-generating projects involve business collaborators on whose performance our revenue is dependent. If these business collaborators fail to deliver their products or perform their obligations on a timely basis or fail to generate sufficient demand for the systems they manufacture, our revenue from the project may be delayed or decreased, and we may not be successful in selling our products.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy successfully, our financial performance could be harmed.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Our business strategy envisions several initiatives, including driving revenue growth and enhancing operating results by increasing customer adoption of our products by targeting high-growth segments with commercial and system-level products. We may not be able to implement our business strategy successfully or achieve the anticipated benefits of our business plan. If we are unable to do so, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business plan successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all. In addition, to the extent we have misjudged the nature and extent of industry trends or our competition, we may have difficulty in achieving our strategic objectives. Any failure to implement our business strategy successfully may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or increased operating costs or expenses.\nProblems with product quality or product performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and prevent us from achieving increased sales and market share.\nConsistent with customary practice in our industry, we guarantee our products and/or services to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service. We generally provide a one- to three-year warranty on our products, commencing upon installation. A provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenues for estimated warranty expense based on historical experience. The possibility of future product failures or issues related to services we provided could cause us to incur substantial expenses to repair or replace defective products or re-perform such services potentially in excess of our reserves. Furthermore, widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and reduce our market share and cause sales to decline.\nMany of our customers outside of the United States may be either directly or indirectly related to governmental entities, and we could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws outside the United States.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many of our customers outside of the United States are, either directly or indirectly, related to governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have had limited success marketing and selling our superconductor products and system-level solutions, and our failure to more broadly market and sell our products and solutions could lower our revenue and cash flow.\nTo date, we have had limited success marketing and selling our superconductor products and system-level solutions. Once our products and solutions are ready for widespread commercial use, we will have to develop a marketing and sales organization that will effectively demonstrate the advantages of our products over more traditional products, competing superconductor products and other technologies. We may not be successful in our efforts to market this technology and we may not be able to establish an effective sales and distribution organization.\nWe may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties for the marketing or distribution of our products, including arrangements in which our products, such as Amperium wire, are included as a component of a larger product, such as a power cable system. By entering into marketing and sales alliances, the financial benefits to us of commercializing our products will be dependent on the efforts of others.\nWe may acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies, which may require us to incur substantial costs for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits.\nOur recent acquisitions require substantial integration and management efforts. As a result of any additional acquisition we pursue, management\u2019s attention and resources may be further diverted from our other businesses. An acquisition may also involve the payment of a significant purchase price, which could reduce our cash position or dilute our stockholders and require significant transaction-related expenses.\nAchieving the benefits of any acquisition involves additional risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty assimilating acquired operations, technologies and personnel;\n\u2022\ninability to retain management and other key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nchanges in management or other key personnel that may harm relationships with the acquired business\u2019s customers and employees;\n\u2022\nunforeseen liabilities of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention from other business matters as a result of the integration process;\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs associated with the acquired business, including synergies;\n\u2022\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt used to finance the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas, with new customers, or in new geographic areas.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, including our NEPSI Acquisition in October 2020, and Neeltran, Inc. acquisition completed in May 2021, and if we fail to realize these anticipated benefits, our operating performance could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Markets\nOur success depends upon the commercial adoption of the REG system, which is currently limited, and a widespread commercial market for our products may not develop.\nTo date, there has been no widespread commercial use of the REG system. It is uncertain whether a robust commercial market for those new and unproven products will ever develop.\nIn addition, we believe in-grid demonstrations of REG systems are necessary to convince utilities and power grid operators of the benefits of this technology. Even if a project is funded, completion of projects can be delayed as a result of other factors. It is possible that the market demands we currently anticipate for our REG system will not develop and that they will never achieve widespread commercial acceptance. In such event, we would not be able to implement our strategy, and our results of operations could be reduced or eliminated. Even if a commercial market for our REG systems were to develop, commercial terms requested by utilities and power grid operators relating to bonding requirements, limitations of liability, warranty periods, or other contractual provisions, may not be acceptable to us, which could impede our ability to enter into contractual arrangements for the sale of our REG system.\nAdverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. In recent years, and particularly in fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the state of both the domestic and global economies has been uncertain due to the difficulty in obtaining credit, and financial market volatility. Adverse credit conditions in the future could have a negative impact on our ability to execute on future strategic activities. In addition, if credit is difficult to obtain in the future, some customers may delay or reduce purchases. Similarly, inflationary pressures may increase our costs or force us to increase prices for our products. These events could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies, increased accounts receivable and inventory write-offs and increased price competition. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have operations in, and depend on sales in, emerging markets, including India, and global conditions could negatively affect our operating results or limit our ability to expand our operations outside of these markets. Changes in India\u2019s political, social, regulatory and economic environment may affect our financial performance.\nWe have operations in India and in recent years a significant portion of our total revenues has been derived from customers in this market. Our financial performance depends upon our ability to carry on our operations and sell our products in markets such as India, as well as other emerging markets around the world. We are, and will continue to be, subject to financial, political, economic and business risks in connection with our operations and sales in these emerging markets. In addition to the business risks inherent in developing and servicing these markets, economic conditions may be more volatile, legal and regulatory systems less developed and predictable, and the possibility of various types of adverse governmental action more pronounced in emerging markets. In addition, inflation, fluctuations in currency and interest rates, competitive factors, civil unrest, public health emergencies and labor problems could affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations. Our operations could also be adversely affected by acts of war, terrorism or the threat of any of these events as well as government actions such as controls on imports, exports and prices, tariffs, new forms of taxation, or changes in fiscal regimes and increased government regulation in the countries in which we operate or service customers. Unexpected or uncontrollable events or circumstances in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nOur financial performance could be affected by the political and social environment in India. In recent years, India has experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries. The potential for hostilities between India and Pakistan has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in India and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment, including events in and related to Afghanistan and Iraq.\nWith respect to our activities in all emerging markets, we may be impacted by issues with managing foreign sales operations, including long payment cycles, potential difficulties in accounts receivable collection and, especially from significant customers, fluctuations in the timing and amount of orders. The adverse effect of any of these issues on our business could be increased due to the concentration of our business with a small number of customers. Operations in foreign countries also expose us to risks relating to difficulties in enforcing our proprietary rights, currency fluctuations and adverse or deteriorating economic conditions. If we experience problems with obtaining registrations, compliance with foreign country or applicable U.S. laws, or if we experience difficulties in payments or intellectual property matters in foreign jurisdictions, or if significant political, economic or regulatory changes occur, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur products face competition, which could limit our ability to acquire or retain customers.\nThe markets for our products are competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and research and development, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. In addition, as our target markets develop, other large industrial companies may enter these fields and compete with us.\nWe face competition from other companies offering FACTS systems similar to our D-VAR products. These include adaptive VAR compensators, Dynamic voltage restorers (\u201cDVRs\u201d), and STATCOMs produced by ABB, Siemens, RXHK, NR Electric Co,. and Ingeteam, and battery-based uninterruptible power supply (\u201cUPS\u201d) systems offered by various companies around the world.\nWith our HTS-based REG product, we are offering a new approach that provides alternatives to utilities for power system design. Therefore, we believe that we compete with traditional approaches such as new full-sized substations, overhead and underground transmission, and urban power transformers.\nWe believe we are currently the only company that can offer HTS-based SPS products that have been fully qualified for use aboard U.S. Navy surface combatants. Therefore, the primary competition for our SPS products is currently coming from defense contractors that provide the copper-based systems that our lighter, more efficient HTS versions have been developed to replace. Companies such as L3, Excelis, Raytheon, and Textron have the bulk of the copper-based business today.\nAs the HTS wire, superconductor electric motors and generators, and power electronic systems markets develop, other large industrial companies may enter those fields and compete with us. If we are unable to compete successfully, it may harm our business, which in turn may limit our ability to acquire or retain customers.\nWith respect to our Wind business, other companies that serve the wind turbine components industry include ABB, Hopewind, and Semikron. We also face indirect competition in the wind energy market from global manufacturers of wind turbines, such as Siemens Gamesa, General Electric, and Suzlon. We face competition for the supply of wind turbine engineering design services from design engineering firms such as Aerodyn.\nOur international operations are subject to risks that we do not face in the United States, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn recent years, a substantial amount of our consolidated revenues were recognized from customers outside of the United States. For example, 41% of our revenues in fiscal 2020 and 51% of our revenues in fiscal 2019 were recognized from sales outside the United States. We also manufacture certain of our products and purchase a portion of our raw materials and components from suppliers in other foreign countries. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks that we do not face in the United States, including:\n\u2022\npotentially longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\nadditional withholding taxes or other taxes on our foreign income and repatriated cash, and tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including export duties and quotas, trade and employment restrictions;\n\u2022\nimposition of, or unexpected adverse changes in, foreign laws or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, pandemics, political unrest, war or acts of terrorism.\nTrade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as those between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and other countries have been escalating in recent years. For example, the prior U.S. presidential administration imposed tariffs on products imported from China in recent years, which had an impact on our products and supplies imported from China to the U.S., and the Chinese government countered with additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods. We cannot predict whether the United States or any other country will impose new quotas, tariffs, taxes or other trade barriers upon the importation or exportation of our products or gauge the effect that new barriers would have on our financial position or results of operations. These new tariffs or any additional tariffs or other trade barriers may cause our costs to increase, our products to be less competitive, and our business, results of operations and financial position to be materially adversely affected.\nOur overall success in international markets depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country where we do business or conduct operations. Our failure to manage these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, thus lowering our total revenue and increasing losses.\nGrowth of the wind energy market depends largely on the availability and size of government subsidies, economic incentives and legislative programs designed to support the growth of wind energy.\nAt present, the cost of wind energy exceeds the cost of conventional power generation in many locations around the world. Various governments have used different policy initiatives to encourage or accelerate the development and adoption of wind energy and other renewable energy sources. Renewable energy policies are in place in the European Union, certain countries in Asia, including India, China, Japan and South Korea, and many of the states in Australia and the United States. Examples of government sponsored financial incentives include capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of wind energy products to promote the use of wind energy and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. In the United States, various legislation and regulations designed to support the growth of wind energy have been implemented or proposed by the federal government, such as the Production Tax Credit for Renewable Energy (\u201cPTC\u201d) and the Clean Power Plan. Governments, including the U.S. government, may decide to reduce or eliminate these economic incentives, or curtail legislative programs supportive of wind energy technologies for political, financial or other reasons. Any reductions in, or eliminations of, government subsidies, economic incentives or favorable legislative programs before the wind energy industry reaches a sufficient scale to be cost-effective in a non-subsidized marketplace could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations.\nLower prices for other fuel sources may reduce the demand for wind energy development, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our Wind business.\nThe wind energy market is affected by the price and availability of other fuels, including nuclear, coal, natural gas and oil, as well as other sources of renewable energy. To the extent renewable energy, particularly wind energy, becomes less cost-competitive due to reduced government targets, increases in the cost of wind energy, as a result of new regulations, and incentives that favor alternative renewable energy, cheaper alternatives or otherwise, demand for wind energy and other forms of renewable energy could decrease. Slow growth or a long-term reduction in the demand for renewable energy could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our Wind business.\nRisks Related to Our Technologies\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets or independently develop processes or products that are similar or identical to our trade secrets and courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nOur patents may not provide meaningful protection for our technology, which could result in us losing some or all of our market position.\nWe own or have licensing rights under many patents and pending patent applications. However, the patents that we own or license may not provide us with meaningful protection of our technologies and may not prevent our competitors from using similar technologies for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\u2022\nthe patent applications that we or our licensors file may not result in patents being issued;\n\u2022\nany patents issued may be challenged by third parties; and\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar technologies not protected by our patents or design around the patented aspects of any technologies we develop.\nMoreover, we could incur substantial litigation costs in defending the validity of or enforcing our own patents. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our intellectual property. However, our non-disclosure agreements and other safeguards may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information. If the patents that we own or license or our trade secrets and proprietary know-how fail to protect our technologies, our market position may be adversely affected.\nThere are a number of technological challenges that must be successfully addressed before our superconductor products can gain widespread commercial acceptance, and our inability to address such technological challenges could adversely affect our ability to acquire customers for our products.\nMany of our superconductor products are in the early stages of commercialization, while others are still under development. There are a number of technological challenges that we must successfully address to complete our development and commercialization efforts for superconductor products. We will also need to improve the performance and reduce the cost of our Amperium wire to expand the number of commercial applications for it. We may be unable to meet such technological challenges or to sufficiently improve the performance and reduce the costs of our Amperium wire. Delays in development, as a result of technological challenges or other factors, may result in the introduction or commercial acceptance of our superconductor products later than anticipated.\nThird parties have or may acquire patents that cover the materials, processes and technologies we use or may use in the future to manufacture our Amperium products, and our success depends on our ability to license such patents or other proprietary rights.\nWe expect that some or all of the HTS materials, processes and technologies we use in designing and manufacturing our products are or will become covered by patents issued to other parties, including our competitors. The owners of these patents may refuse to grant licenses to us, or may be willing to do so only on terms that we find commercially unreasonable. If we are unable to obtain these licenses, we may have to contest the validity or scope of those patents or re-engineer our products to avoid infringement claims by the owners of these patents. It is possible that we will not be successful in contesting the validity or scope of a patent, or that we will not prevail in a patent infringement claim brought against us. Even if we are successful in such a proceeding, we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in prosecuting or defending such a proceeding.\nOur technology and products could infringe intellectual property rights of others, which may require costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and disrupt our business.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology-related industries. There may be patents or patent applications in the United States or other countries that are pertinent to our products or business of which we are not aware. The technology that we incorporate into and use to develop and manufacture our current and future products, including the technologies we license, may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others. The success of our business will also depend on our ability to develop new technologies without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. Third parties may allege that we infringe patents, trademarks or copyrights, or that we misappropriated trade secrets. These allegations could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management. If a successful claim were brought against us and we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if it is determined that we have willfully infringed such rights, or be enjoined from using the technology deemed to be infringing, or using, making or selling products deemed to be infringing. If we have supplied infringing products or technology to third parties, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses they may sustain as a result of the infringement. In addition, we may need to attempt to license the intellectual property right from such third party or spend time and money to design around or avoid the intellectual property. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities and/or disrupt our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, market price and volume fluctuations, which may prevent our stockholders from selling our common stock at a profit and could lead to costly litigation against us that could divert our management\u2019s attention.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced volatility and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. Factors such as our financial performance, liquidity requirements, technological achievements by us and our competitors, the establishment of development or strategic relationships with other companies, strategic acquisitions, new customer orders and contracts, and our introduction of commercial products may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. The stock market in general, and the stock of high technology companies, in particular, have, in recent years, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular companies, such as in connection with the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Such broad market fluctuations have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to these factors, the price of our common stock may decline, and investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock for a profit. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. In the past, we have been subject to a number of class action lawsuits which were filed against us on behalf of certain purchasers of our common stock. If we become subject to additional litigation of this kind in the future, it could result in additional litigation costs, a damages award against us and the further diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient, our assets may be insufficient to cover any amounts that exceed our insurance coverage, and we may have to pay damage awards or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with such claims. Any such payments or settlement arrangements in legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Regardless of merit, legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, such lawsuits may make it more difficult to finance our operations.", "PERMNO": 77175, "SIC": 3621, "TIC": "AMSC"}
