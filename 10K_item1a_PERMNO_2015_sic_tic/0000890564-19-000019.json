{"cik": "890564", "company": "ASGN Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to, the following:\nU.S. and global market and economic developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for the contract staffing services that we provide is significantly affected by global market and economic conditions. As economic activity slows, many clients or potential clients reduce their use of and reliance upon contract professionals. During periods of reduced economic activity, we may also be subject to increased competition for market share and pricing pressure. As a result, a recession or periods of reduced economic activity could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to remain competitive in obtaining and retaining temporary staffing clients, our future growth will suffer. Agreements may be terminated by clients at will and the termination of a significant number of such agreements would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe contract staffing industry is highly competitive and fragmented with limited barriers to entry. We compete in national, regional and local markets with full-service agencies and in regional and local markets with specialized contract staffing agencies. The success of our business depends upon our ability to continually secure new orders from clients and to fill those orders with our contract professionals.\nOur agreements with clients do not provide for exclusive use of our services and in some instances we provide services without entering into contracts. As such, clients are free to place orders with our competitors. If clients terminate a significant number of our staffing agreements or do not use us for future assignments and we are unable to generate new contract staffing orders to replace lost revenues, the growth of our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and results of operations could be harmed. As a result, it is imperative to our business that we maintain positive relationships with our clients. We are expanding our light deliverables-based professional services model whereby we perform certain project oversight functions. If we are not able to comply with these performance requirements, our revenues and relationships with our clients may be adversely affected.\nTo the extent that competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices or increasing marketing expenditures, we could lose revenues and our margins could decline, which could harm our operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline. We expect competition for clients to increase in the future and the success and growth of our business depends on our ability to remain competitive. In addition, we participate in a number of third-party contracts as a subcontractor and that requires us to participate in vendor management contracts, which may subject us to greater risks or lower margins.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified contract professionals, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon our ability to attract and retain contract professionals who possess the skills, experience and licenses which may be required to meet the specified requirements of our clients. We compete for such contract professionals with other temporary staffing companies and with our clients and potential clients. There can be no assurance that qualified professionals will be available to us in adequate numbers to staff our temporary assignments. Moreover, our contract professionals are often hired to become regular employees of our clients, and their employment is terminable at will. Attracting and retaining contract professionals depends on several factors, including our ability to provide contract professionals with desirable assignments and competitive wages and benefits. The cost of attracting and retaining contract professionals in the future may be higher than we anticipate if there is an increase in competitive wages and benefits and, as a result, if we are unable to pass these costs on to our clients, our likelihood of achieving or maintaining profitability could decline. In periods of low unemployment, there may be a shortage of, and significant competition for, the skilled contract professionals sought by our clients. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of contract professionals to meet client demand, we may be required to forgo staffing and revenue opportunities, which may hurt the growth of our business. In periods of high unemployment, contract professionals frequently opt for full-time employment directly with clients and, due to a large pool of available candidates, clients are able to directly hire and recruit qualified candidates without the involvement of staffing agencies.\nWe utilize subcontractor firms who employ individuals with the H-1B visa classification. The H-1B visa classification is subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement. Immigration laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political developments and levels of economic activity. Current and future restrictions on the availability of such visas could limit our subcontractors\u2019 ability to employ and/or retain the skilled professionals we need to meet our clients\u2019 needs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we are unable to meet our expectations for growth, our forecasted results and stock price are likely to be adversely affected.\nOver the past several years, we have experienced revenue and earnings growth both organically and through acquisitions. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue this pace of growth in the future or meet our strategic objectives for growth. Our growth could be adversely affected by many factors, including future technology industry conditions, macroeconomic events, competition and labor market trends or regulations. If our growth rate slows, or if it fails to grow at the pace anticipated and we are unable to be successful in our growth initiatives and strategies, our financial results could be less than our expectations or those of investors or analysts and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy also includes continuing efforts to integrate and optimize our organization, programs, technology and delivery of services to make us a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. We may not be successful in our continuing integration and optimization efforts and they may fail to achieve the cost savings we anticipate or limit our ability to scale growth. Further, we may fail to prevent the return of costs eliminated in these efforts. If we are not successful in implementing our integration and optimization efforts, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to government regulation, which in the future could restrict the types of employment services we are permitted to offer or result in additional or increased costs that reduce our revenues and earnings.\nThe temporary staffing services industry is regulated in the United States and other countries in which we operate. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the employer/employee relationship, such as those related to payment of federal, state and local payroll and unemployment taxes for our corporate employees and contractor professional employees, tax withholding, social security or retirement benefits, licensing, wage and hour requirements, paid sick leave, paid family leave and other leaves, employee benefits, pay equity, non-discrimination, sexual harassment, workers\u2019 compensation, and we must further comply with immigration laws and a wide variety of notice and administrative requirements, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. We are also subject to U.S. laws and regulations relating to government contracts with federal agencies, as well as the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d). In certain other countries, we may not be considered the legal employers of our temporary personnel, however are still responsible for collecting taxes and social security deductions and transmitting these amounts to the taxing authorities.\nIn addition, we are subject to data privacy, protection and security laws and regulations, the most significant of which is the European General Data Protection Act (\u201cGDPR\u201d) that governs the personal information of European persons which we may collect, use and retain in the ordinary course of our business. This law impacts our U.S. operations as well as our European operations as it applies not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. The GDPR imposes more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information that is potentially confidential and/or personally identifiable and sensitive, such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the European Union and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms. California has recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 which goes into effect in 2020 and models the GDPR in part. Any inadvertent non-compliance of the GDPR or other data privacy laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and reputation.\nFuture changes in the laws or governmental regulations affecting our business may result in the prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services that we are permitted to offer, or the imposition of new or additional legal requirements that could increase our costs and reduce our revenues and earnings. Due to the substantial number of state and local jurisdictions in which we operate, there also is a risk that we may be unaware of, or unable to adequately monitor, actual or proposed changes in, or the interpretation of, the laws or governmental regulations of such states and localities. Any delay in our compliance with changes in such laws or governmental regulations could result in potential fines, penalties, or other sanctions for non-compliance. In addition, although we may elect to bill some or all of any additional costs to our customers, there can be no assurances that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to fully cover any increased costs as a result of future changes in laws or government regulations.\nSignificant legal actions and claims could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities, result in damage to our business reputation, result in the discontinuation of our client relationships and adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Our ability to control or influence the workplace environment of our clients is limited. Further, many of the individuals that we place with our clients have access to client information systems and confidential information. As the employer of record of our contract professionals, we incur a risk of liability to our contract professionals for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. Other inherent risks include possible claims of errors and omissions; intentional misconduct; release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property; criminal activity; torts; or other claims. We also have been subject to legal actions alleging vicarious liability, intentional torts, negligent hiring, discrimination, sexual harassment, retroactive entitlement to employee benefits, violation of wage and hour requirements, retaliation and related legal theories. These types of actions could involve large claims and significant defense costs. We may be subject to liability in such cases even if the contribution to the alleged injury was minimal. Moreover, in most instances, we are required to indemnify clients against some or all of these risks and we could be required to pay substantial sums to fulfill our indemnification obligations. In addition, certain of our clients currently require, and other clients in the future may require, that we indemnify them against losses in the event that the client is determined to be non-compliant with the ACA due to a joint employer claim.\nA failure of any of our employees internally or contract professionals in client's workplaces to observe our policies and guidelines intended to reduce these risks could result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, payment of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse impacts on our business. Claims raised by clients stemming from the improper actions of our contract professionals, even if without merit, could cause us to incur significant expense associated with the costs or damages related to such claims. Further, such claims by clients could damage our business reputation and result in the discontinuation of client relationships. Any associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified contract professionals in the future.\nWe proactively address many of these issues with our robust compliance program. Further, to protect ourselves from the costs and damages of significant legal actions and claims, we maintain workers\u2019 compensation, errors and omissions, employment practices and general liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. Our coverage includes a retention amount and our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. In addition, we face various employment-related risks not covered by insurance, such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility. If we do not maintain adequate insurance coverage or are made party to significant uninsured claims, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA loss or reduction in revenues from one or more large client accounts could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur clients range in size from large national or multinational companies to small and mid-market businesses. In 2018, no single client represented more than six percent of our consolidated revenues. Contracts with the U.S. Army generated approximately 32 percent of our ECS Segment revenues. Our large clients may enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several staffing firms and the client is generally able to terminate our contracts on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of these large clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. The loss of one or more of our large national or multinational clients, or a significant decrease in their demand for our services, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not successfully make or integrate acquisitions, which could harm our business and growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to opportunistically pursue selected acquisitions. We compete with other companies in the professional staffing and consulting industries for acquisition opportunities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or be able to complete future acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. There also can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits expected from any transaction or receive a favorable return on investment from our acquisitions.\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to finance our acquisitions, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by investors, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe integration of an acquisition involves a number of factors that may affect our operations. These factors include diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, difficulties or delay in the integration of acquired operations, retention of key personnel, entry into unfamiliar markets, significant unanticipated costs or legal liabilities, and tax and accounting issues. If we fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, we may incur tax and accounting changes. Furthermore, once we have integrated an acquired business, the business may not achieve anticipated levels of revenue, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected. Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect the execution of our business strategy and our financial results.\nWe believe that the successful execution of our business strategy and our ability to build upon our business and acquisitions of new businesses depends on the continued employment of key members of our senior management team. We have provided short-term and long-term incentive compensation to our key management in an effort to retain them. However, if members of our senior management team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we could incur significant costs and experience business disruption related to time spent on efforts to replace them and our financial results and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nImpairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could materially affect future results of operations.\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets (consisting entirely of trademarks) for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets having finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events and changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable may include: (i) macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in general economic conditions, (ii) industry and market considerations, such as deterioration in the environment in which we operate, (iii) cost factors, such as increases in labor or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, (iv) our financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or projected earnings, (v) sustained decreases in our market capitalization and (vi) other relevant entity-specific events, such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or customers. We may be required to record a charge in our financial statements during the period in which we determine an impairment has occurred. Although an impairment charge would not affect our cash flow, it would adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to business risks associated with international operations, which could increase our costs, cause our results of operations to fluctuate, and adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we have limited experience in marketing, selling and supporting our services outside of the United States, we had international sales in Canada and Europe in 2018. Our international operations comprised approximately five percent of total sales in 2018. We also have offices and employees outside the United States. Our sales and operations outside the United States expose us to currency, operational, regulatory and political risks in the countries in which we operate. With respect to currency risks, significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to foreign currencies could adversely affect our costs and operating margins and could result in exchange losses or otherwise have a material effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Other risks associated with our international operations include, among other things, the effects of local economic and political conditions, competition from local companies, lack of brand recognition, increased costs, difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in foreign labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain contract professionals and employees, trade protectionism, restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders, U.S. relations with the governments of foreign countries in which we operate, difficulty in complying with foreign law, and changes in tax laws. If we are not able to manage these risks, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOn March 29, 2017, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) officially triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, signaling the start of a two-year period in which the UK will negotiate the terms for its exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). Political negotiations are ongoing, however, there is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the UK's exit from the EU and the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the UK and the EU has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the UK and the EU. Until the terms of the UK's exit from the EU are determined, including any transition period, it is difficult to predict its impact. It is possible that the withdrawal could, among other things, affect the legal and regulatory environments to which our businesses are subject, impact trade between the UK and the EU and other parties, and create economic and political uncertainty in the region.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services.\nOur success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services. We rely on a variety of technologies to support important functions in our business, including the recruitment, placement and monitoring of our contract professionals; billing; and candidate and client data analytics. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, such as emerging job and resume posting services, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve our business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, our services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain our business could be adversely affected.\nAn information technology system failure or security breach could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur information technology systems are used in daily business operations to, among other things, identify staffing resources, match personnel with client assignments and manage our accounting and financial reporting functions. In conducting our business, we routinely collect and retain personal information on our employees and contract professionals and their dependents including, without limitation, full names, social security numbers, addresses, birth dates and payroll-related information. Our information systems are vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Although we use commercially available information security technologies and have implemented security controls to help protect the security and privacy of our business information, our information technology systems are subject to potential security breaches through employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, business email compromise, and cybersecurity threats, including denial of service attacks, viruses or other malicious software programs and third parties gaining unauthorized access to our information technology systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. Because the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. All of these risks are also applicable wherever we rely on outside vendors to provide services.\nIf our information technology systems and security controls do not provide sufficient protection from these threats, we could experience the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential data about us or our employees, contract professionals or customers, as well as business interruptions or delays and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. We may also be subject to liability and claims for monetary damages for any unauthorized disclosure of confidential information about our employees, contract professionals or customers, which could result in adverse publicity, reputational damage and a reduced demand for our services by clients and/or consultants. In addition, privacy breaches may require notification and other remedies, which can be costly, and which may have other serious adverse consequences for our business, including regulatory enforcement actions resulting in fines and penalties under laws that protect personal data and confidential information.\nFailure of internal controls may leave us susceptible to errors and fraud.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, would be detected, particularly in our acquired companies and international operations. If our internal controls are unsuccessful, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.1 billion of total debt, which could adversely affect our operating flexibility, and the restrictive covenants under our debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations or additional costs.\nOur level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe have to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service rather than for our operations;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing;\n\u2022\nthe debt under our credit facilities is at a variable interest rate, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates;\n\u2022\nwe could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nwe may be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage.\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the requirement to repay such borrowings before their due date. Some covenants are tied to our operating results and thus may be breached if we do not perform as expected. Further, the terms of our credit facility permit additional borrowings, subject to certain conditions. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify.\nWe expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to repay borrowings under our credit facility primarily from our operations. Our ability to pay our expenses thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. If we do not have enough money, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets or borrow additional funds. We may not be able to take such actions on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. The lenders may require fees and expenses to be paid or other changes to terms in connection with waivers or amendments. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and/or rates.\nA significant loss or suspension of our facility security clearances with the federal government could lead to a reduction in our revenues, cash flows and operating results.\nWe act as a contractor and a subcontractor to the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Some government contracts require us to maintain facility security clearances and require some of our employees to maintain individual security clearances. If our employees lose or are unable to timely obtain security clearances, or we lose a facility clearance, a government agency client may terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration. In addition, a security breach by us could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for federal government clients.\nWe derive significant revenues from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. Our revenues and profitability may be adversely impacted if we fail to compete effectively in such processes.\nOur contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process, which creates significant competition and pricing pressure. We spend time and resources to prepare bids and proposals for contracts. Some of these contracts may not be awarded to us, or if awarded we may not receive meaningful task orders under these contracts. We may encounter delays and additional expenses if our competitors protest or challenge contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract. If we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be prevented from providing to customers services that are purchased under those contracts for a number of years. In addition, upon the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs, time and resources.\nOur ECS Segment generates revenues under various types of contracts: firm-fixed-price, cost-plus-fixed-fee and time and materials. Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the costs incurred in their performance and the nature of services or solutions provided. Under firm-fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks and services for a fixed price. Compared to cost-plus-fixed-fee, firm-fixed-price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities, but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns. When making proposals on firm-fixed-price contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the associated projects. Failure to accurately estimate costs, resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during the performance of work could result in reduced profits or in losses. Under cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs plus a profit margin or fee. These contracts generally have lower profitability and less financial risk. Under time and materials contracts, we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. We assume financial risk on time and materials contracts because we assume the risk of performing those contracts at negotiated hourly rates.\nWe are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations related to government contracts, some of which are complex and our failure to comply could result in fines or civil or criminal penalties, or suspension or debarment, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government customers. Such laws and regulations may potentially impose added costs on our business and our failure to comply with them may lead to civil or criminal penalties, termination of our U.S. government contracts and/or suspension or debarment from contracting with U.S. government agencies. All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source and could damage our reputation and impair our ability to compete for future contracts. Failure to comply with regulations and required practices and procedures could harm our reputation or influence the award of new contracts.\nAudits by U.S. government agencies for contracts with federal government clients could result in unfavorable audit results that could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions and could harm our reputation and relationships with our customers and adversely impact results of operations.\nFederal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\") and the Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\"), routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors\u2019 administrative processes and systems. These agencies review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies.\nChanges in U.S. government spending or budgetary priorities, the failure of government budgets to be approved on a timely basis, or delays in contract awards and other procurement activity may significantly and adversely affect our future financial results.\nOur business depends upon continued U.S. government expenditures on intelligence, defense, homeland security, federal health IT and other programs that we support. The U.S. government conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities which may shift Department of Defense budgetary priorities, reduce overall spending or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contract renewals. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement. Our revenues, cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in budgetary priorities, as well as by delays in the government budget process, program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts.\nWe may not realize the full value of our ECS Segment contract backlog, which may result in lower revenues than anticipated.\nContract backlog is a useful measure of potential future revenues for our ECS Segment. Our ECS Segment contract backlog consists of contracts for which funding has been formally awarded (funded backlog), and unfunded backlog, which represents the estimated future revenues to be earned from negotiated contract awards for which funding has not been awarded and from unexercised contract options.\nThe U.S. government's ability to not exercise contract options or to modify, curtail or terminate our contracts makes the calculation of our ECS Segment backlog subject to numerous uncertainties. Due to the uncertain nature of our contracts with the U.S. government, we may never realize revenue from some of the engagements that are included in our contract backlog. Our unfunded backlog, in particular, contains amounts that we may never realize as revenue because the maximum contract value specified under a U.S. government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract.\nOur business may be materially affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to taxation in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or by changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.\nIn the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a dividends received deduction for dividends from foreign subsidiaries, imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a minimum tax on foreign earnings, limitations on deduction of business interest expense and limits on deducting compensation to certain executive officers.\nVarious levels of government also are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe trading price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations, which could make it difficult for us to access the public markets for financing or use our common stock as consideration in a strategic transaction.\nIn 2018, the trading price of our common stock experienced significant fluctuations, ranging from a high of $94.25 to a low of $51.05. The closing price of our common stock on the NYSE was $65.86 on February 20, 2019. Our common stock may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a large number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nperiod to period fluctuations in our financial results or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet previously announced guidance or analysts\u2019 expectations of our quarterly results;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, any significant litigation matter;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board or management;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nsale or purchase of stock by us or by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, slow or negative growth of unrelated markets and other external factors.\nOur results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, including, among other things, the level of demand for our temporary staffing services, changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors, our ability to control costs and our ability to manage our accounts receivable balances, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business and could cause instability in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the trading prices of the common stock of many companies involved in the temporary staffing industry.\nAs a result of these fluctuations, we may encounter difficulty should we desire to access the public markets for financing or use our common stock as consideration in a strategic transaction.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control that our stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the impact of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nOur Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy in the Board of Directors upon the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors until the next applicable annual meeting of stockholders.\n\u2022\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. Further, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, and only one class is up for election each year. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\n\u2022\nOur Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, up to one million shares of undesignated or \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated or \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt by, or make it more difficult for, a third- party to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any large stockholders who hold 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting capital stock in a merger or business combination unless the holder has held the stock for three years, the Board of Directors has expressly approved the merger or business transaction, or at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting capital stock not owned by such large stockholder approves the merger or the transaction. These provisions of Delaware law may have the impact of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control and may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price. In addition, our Board of Directors could rely on these provisions of Delaware law to discourage, prevent, or delay an acquisition of us.", "PERMNO": 77917, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "ASGN"}
