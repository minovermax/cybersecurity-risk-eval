{"cik": "1665658", "company": "CommerceHub, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section entitled \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" in evaluating our Company. Any of the following risks, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. The risks described below are those we consider the most material, although they are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial could also materially adversely affect us.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nConsolidation or simplification of the ecommerce industry could diminish demand for our solutions.\nThe ecommerce industry is complex and fragmented, and our solutions are designed to help customers navigate this complexity, including disparate online channels. Although the number and variety of online channels available to retailers and their suppliers have generally been increasing, the share of online sales made through a small number of larger channels, particularly Amazon, has also been increasing. If the trend toward consolidation around a few large online channels accelerates, the difficulties faced by retailers and brands, which our solutions are designed to address, could decline, and more companies could potentially maintain competing solutions in-house or through on-premise software solutions they manage. We have also seen certain large retailers expand their own online distribution channels, including Walmart's launch of the Walmart Marketplace and acquisition of Jet.com and a number of other online retailers. If our solutions become less important to retailers and their suppliers or brands and other sellers, our sales and opportunities for growth could decline and our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe market for ecommerce solutions, applications and services is very competitive. While no single competitor currently offers all of the solutions that we offer, we do have competitors with longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Increased competition may result in reduced pricing for our solutions, longer sales cycles or a decrease in our market share, any of which could negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nA number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell our solutions at lower prices or at reduced margins, including, among others:\n\u2022\ncurrent and potential customers may develop or expand their existing use of competing in-house solutions or may acquire external solutions or providers of solutions, rather than pay for our solutions;\n\u2022\nmarketplaces, retailers and other demand channels, which typically offer software tools, often for free, that allow trading partners seeking to sell on these channels to connect to them, may decide to compete more vigorously with us or make it easier for our customers to self-service their omnichannel strategies, rather than relying on our offerings to assist their efforts;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive sales terms, adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements, and devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can;\n\u2022\ncurrent and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and expand their markets;\n\u2022\nnew competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share;\n\u2022\ncurrent and potential competitors may offer technology or services that address one or more ecommerce needs at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solutions and may be able to devote greater resources to those solutions than we can; and\n\u2022\nsoftware vendors could bundle ecommerce solutions with other solutions or offer such products and services at a lower price as part of a larger product sale.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to acquire, merge with or partner with another of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could suffer. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners or other parties with whom we or our customers or prospects have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote our solutions. Consolidation in our industry is likely to increase and could negatively impact our business.\nCompetition in our industry may also intensify as our competitors raise additional capital and enter into business combinations or alliances. New competitors may also emerge as established companies in other market segments or\ngeographic markets expand into our market segments or geographic markets. If we cannot compete successfully, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe loss, poor performance or financial difficulty of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nSome of our customers and their trading partners have experienced financial difficulties, particularly certain traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Insolvency, credit problems or other financial difficulties confronting our customers could expose us to financial risk. Additionally, if our customers reduce the volume or size of the ecommerce sales they process or generate through our platform, for example, as a result of declines in our customers' overall sales or greater reliance on fulfillment methods that do not utilize our services, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur revenue model, in large part, is based on retailer and supplier program relationships whereby many revenue-generating supplier transactions conducted through our platform may be attributable to a single retailer. Although no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in either of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, or 2015, for the year ended December 31, 2017 there were seven customers with Total Program Revenue that accounted for greater than 5% each of our total revenue, two of which had Total Program Revenue that accounted for between 10% and 15% each of our total revenue.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions with us after the term expires, and even if they renew they may not do so on the same or on more profitable terms. As a result, our ability to grow depends in part on subscription renewals and our ability to meet or exceed our customers' expectations. In addition, a significant portion of our revenue is based on the volume of transactions our customers complete using our platform. This volume often directly correlates to demand for our customers\u2019 products, so if our customers are unable to generate and maintain demand for and sales of their products, they may send fewer transactions through our platform, resulting in lower revenue to us. Furthermore, many of our contracts are non-exclusive, and it is possible that our customers could send fewer transactions through our platform at any time during the contract term, for any reason. We may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals or transaction volumes, and our customers' renewal rates or volumes may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including but not limited to the cost of our services, dissatisfaction with our services, the cost or nature of services offered by our competitors, reductions in our customers' spending levels, internalization of alternative technology solutions by our customers or changes in demand for our customers' products. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, complete fewer transactions or fail to grow their business using our platform, or if they do not purchase additional offerings to complement their existing services, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe ecommerce market changes rapidly, and our inability to respond to changes in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe ecommerce market can change rapidly in multiple ways through frequent new product and service introductions, frequent changes in rules, specifications and other requirements and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase revenue from existing customers is dependent on our ability to understand the changes that are affecting the ecommerce marketplace and to adapt our solutions at a rapid pace to address those changing market conditions. To achieve market acceptance for our solutions, we must effectively anticipate and offer solutions that meet changing customer demands, sales and marketing channels and third-party requirements in a timely manner. Customers and the ecommerce channels that they utilize may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have. If we fail to develop solutions that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to renew our contracts with existing customers and our ability to create or increase demand for our solutions will be impaired.\nWe may experience difficulties with software development, industry standards, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or implementation of new solutions and enhancements. In addition, the introduction of new solutions by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could render our existing or future solutions obsolete.\nAs the ecommerce industry continues to evolve, new demand channels and new technologies will emerge to offer consumers new ways to purchase products. We monitor these new demand channels and technologies and attempt to predict which channels are likely to be successful to select projects we anticipate will generate a positive return on our development investment. Our software development activities can be significant, and recovering our investment may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. Our customers may expect us to support a broader array of demand channels than may be commercially feasible, especially emerging channels that are considered likely to be successful by popular opinion, the media and other industry experts. We may therefore be compelled to invest heavily in development resources to enhance our offerings\nto support new channels that fail to attract consumer usage, take an unexpectedly long time to attract consumer usage, or are successful for our customers and consumers but are disproportionately costly for us to develop, maintain and support. We expect to continue making significant investments in software development, and we may devote resources to advancements that are ultimately unsuccessful, at the expense of other projects that may be more successful, incurring significant opportunity cost to do so. If we deploy significant resources to particular platforms that ultimately fail to attract market participants or materialize as anticipated, we may incur costs that we never recover.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new capabilities and functionality, enhance our existing solutions to anticipate and meet customer preferences and rapidly evolving industry requirements or sell our solutions into new markets, if we fail to realize returns on development initiatives, or if our customers require that we service technologies that are too costly to maintain, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could suffer a material adverse effect.\nIf fewer retailers elect to rely on drop-ship delivery as a means to expand their product assortments, demand for our solutions could decline.\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale and usage of our drop-ship solutions that enable retailers to increase their online product offerings through virtual inventory and leverage suppliers to ship those products directly to consumers. While the market has trended towards increased adoption of drop-ship solutions as a means to offer more products without making large capital investments in inventory and warehouse space and assuming associated inventory risk, use of drop-ship delivery requires retailers to entrust order fulfillment and delivery to third-party suppliers that ship on their behalf. If more retailers elect instead to expand their own warehouses and inventory to assume greater control over order fulfillment, rather than employing drop-ship solutions, or if other methods of fulfillment emerge that are perceived as more effective than drop-shipping, demand for our solutions could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nConditions in the global economy, the geographic markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect us.\nOur business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, the credit market crisis and European debt crisis, uncertainty relating to the Euro and British Pound Sterling, particularly in light of the United Kingdom's intended exit from the EU and uncertainty regarding the terms of such exit, high levels of unemployment globally, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, other austerity measures and other challenges affecting the global economy adversely affect us and our customers, including having the effect of:\n\u2022\nreducing demand for our products and services and limiting the financing available to our customers, resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;\n\u2022\nincreasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nincreasing price competition in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we could be required to record charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets; and\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that our counterparties will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.\nImprovement in the global economy remains uneven and uncertain. If slower growth in the global economy or in any of the geographic markets we serve continues for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or any of the markets we serve or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve and our customers, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure.\nAs our customer base and the amount and types of information shared on our platform continue to grow, we must be able to increase our technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to satisfy the growing needs of our customers. If we fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, our customers could experience degraded service, which could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business and prospects.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the scope of our business operations, which has the potential to place significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources, and these trends may continue.\nWe intend to expand our overall business, customer base, headcount and operations both domestically and internationally, with no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or that our business or revenue will continue to grow in any event.\nWe have also experienced significant growth in the number of users and transactions and the amount of data that our infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain adequate excess capacity in our infrastructure to be sufficiently flexible and scalable to meet the needs of all of our customers, to facilitate the rapid provision of new customer deployments and the expansion of existing customer deployments and to handle spikes in usage, but the provision of new network infrastructure requires significant lead time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, particularly during periods of increased traffic, or if customer traffic patterns significantly change, our customers could experience service degradation or disruption that could result in customer losses and may subject us to financial penalties and liabilities. If our cloud network infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with increased sales and customer expansion, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage growth effectively. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our solutions and services may suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our solutions and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nCybersecurity incidents could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.\nOur business involves the collection and use of confidential and otherwise sensitive information of our customers and their trading partners, including, for example, consumer shipping information and purchasing habits. The collection and use of this information sometimes requires us to integrate with our customers' information systems and other systems operated by our partners and third-party technology providers. We serve as a conduit for transmitting information between our customers and their trading partners, as well as third-party platforms they use, and cannot operationally control the nature of the information transmitted through our systems. In addition, given our critical role as a service provider to the retail industry, we may be an attractive target for cyber attacks. If third parties are able to gain unauthorized access to our system or data we process or to systems operated by our customers, partners or third-party providers, our customers' trust in our security practices and our business could be impaired.\nWe cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of information we process or control will always be successful. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error or misconduct, malfeasance or otherwise, and any such breach may result in one or more third parties obtaining unauthorized access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential or otherwise sensitive information, or our information technology (\"IT\") systems. Additionally, we may be subject to social engineering or other tactics that attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, vendors, technology partners or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target or in some cases long thereafter, we may be unable to anticipate or detect these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Malicious parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services or our customers' websites.\nIf our information security efforts are compromised, or if we fail to detect and appropriately respond to a data security breach, we could be subject to legal or regulatory action, including direct claims by customers or other injured parties, class actions, shareholder derivative suits and governmental action. A data security breach may also negatively affect our reputation, increase our insurance costs or result in loss of coverage, and we may need to incur other significant costs to protect against information security breaches in the future. In addition, because of the critical nature of data security, any perceived breach of our security measures or harm to our reputation could cause existing or potential customers not to use our solutions. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, our customers' or partners' online and other sales may be significantly impacted by cybersecurity incidents limiting the number of revenue-generating transactions they conduct through our platform. For example, our customers or partners may experience \"denial-of-service\" type attacks that could make all or portions of such customers' or partners' websites unavailable for periods of time, or consumer purchases could decline because of mistrust in customers' or partners' security practices. Because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from transactions effected on or through our customers' and partners' websites, operational disruptions such as these could cause our revenue to decline.\nWe may experience service failures or interruptions due to defects in the hardware, software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes that comprise our solutions.\nOur solutions are complex and may contain undetected defects in the hardware, software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes that comprise such solutions. Our solutions are designed to automate various order fulfillment and product listing functions across multiple online channels for large volumes of our customers' sales, as well as to ensure that their sales comply with the policies of each channel, and sometimes to dynamically determine or communicate product pricing and inventory levels at any given moment. If our solutions do not function properly, errors could occur, including that our customers might sell more inventory than they have in stock, make sales that violate channel policies or underprice or overprice their offerings. Overselling inventory could force our customers to cancel orders at rates that violate channel policies, underpricing could result in material losses to our customers and overpricing could result in lost sales. Any of these results or other errors could reduce demand for our solutions and hurt our business reputation.\nIf any defects in our solutions lead to service failures, we could experience delays or lost revenue, diversion of software engineering and management resources, material monetary and non-monetary concessions, damage to our reputation with customers and prospective customers, negative media attention or increased service costs as a result of performance claims during the period required to correct the cause of any such defects. In addition, one or more of our customers could seek recourse against us. Although most of our customer contracts limit our liability for these defects, disruptions and errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our customers' businesses. Where a particular defect is replicated across multiple large customers (as may conceivably occur in the context of a multi-tenant SaaS hosting environment), individual contractual liability caps may be aggregated across multiple claimants to create a much larger exposure. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management's attention and could cause our business to suffer.\nWe cannot be certain that defects will not be found in new solutions or upgraded solutions, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance. Our insurance providers could deny coverage of claims resulting from an error or defect in our technology or a resulting disruption in our solutions, and our insurance coverage might not be adequate to cover all of the damages and other costs associated with such a claim. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our current liability insurance policies will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds our insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our liability insurance coverage terms, including an increase in premiums or imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe use a limited number of data centers to deliver a significant portion of our services, and any disruption of service or security breach at these facilities could harm our business.\nWe manage our services and serve our customers from a limited number of data center facilities. We engineer and architect the computer and storage systems upon which our platform runs, and own and operate our primary data center, in Albany, New York. We also lease redundant (or back-up) data center colocation facilities in Albany, New York and greater Chicago, Illinois, and we do not control the physical operation of these back-up facilities. The owners of these back-up facilities have no obligation to renew their lease agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to locate alternative back-up facilities, and we may incur significant costs and temporary loss of high-availability or disaster recovery services in connection with doing so.\nOur data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, labor strikes, health epidemics, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks, such as misconduct by computer hackers, unauthorized intrusions, computer viruses and denial of service attacks, and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, vandalism or other misconduct, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solutions or impair their functionality. Because we operate a multi-tenant SaaS environment shared by many large customers, such an event, if it occurred, would not be confined to a single customer or small number of customers, but instead would impact a significant portion of our customer base collectively. The occurrence of any such event, or any other events that may cause our customers and potential customers to lose confidence in the reliability of our solutions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nAlthough we plan to expand our use of third-party cloud-based offerings and are moving portions of our service offerings away from traditional data centers, these third-party cloud-based offerings have defined service boundaries in which they operate, and we have minimal, if any, ability to manage how those services are provided. We are dependent on the administrative, physical and procedural safeguards put in place by these third-party providers to protect our confidential\ninformation and customer information. The services and features provided by these third-party providers may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to maintain the right to use these services or are unable to upgrade our arrangements with these providers to accommodate the scalability of our business, our customers could experience a degradation or disruption of service or be unable to access features within our solutions until we can obtain and integrate a functionally equivalent replacement technology. Any available alternatives could be more difficult or costly than currently available third-party offerings. In addition, integration of such alternatives into our platform could require significant work and substantial time and resources. Any delays or failures associated with integrating such alternatives into our platform could injure our reputation with customers and potential customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nAs our customers continue to scrutinize and refine their own data security practices, the security and confidentiality obligations they seek to impose on their SaaS and ecommerce providers are becoming increasingly onerous.\nMany of our customers and potential customers are prominent merchants that process large volumes of sensitive consumer and business data. As such, they are increasingly targeted for cybersecurity attacks and, in turn, they are increasingly seeking to shift these risks by pursuing more onerous contractual terms in their agreements with third-party service providers, including burdensome security procedures, reporting, notification and audit rights, additional warranties, guarantees and other contractual assurances, indemnification provisions, specialized remedies and liability limitation exclusions. Our customers may also seek to require our adherence to customer-specific operational protocols and procedures that may compromise our ability to operate and scale our business efficiently or that may be unworkable. As a result, we are contractually obligated in many cases, and otherwise under intense commercial pressure, to continuously enhance our security programs and incur increased compliance costs to provide current and potential customers with the protections they expect. This contractual and commercial pressure also makes it more difficult to obtain new customers, as we experience longer sales cycles to negotiate mutually acceptable terms, and increases the cost and complexity of our compliance procedures. If we are unsuccessful in our attempts to negotiate acceptable outcomes or meet expectations in this area, we could experience customer erosion, increased compliance requirements and associated costs to satisfy more onerous contractual terms and/or impositions on our ability to grow our sales and attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon the continued acceptance of SaaS solutions as a viable option for providing information technology services.\nWe generate a substantial amount of our revenue from the sale of our solutions and related revenue sources, which are delivered under a SaaS or SaaS-plus model. As a result, continued widespread use and acceptance of this business model is critical to our future growth and success. With increasing concerns around cybersecurity and access to data, some companies are predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, and our customers may become increasingly resistant to accessing software functionality that involves transmission of their sensitive data through a third-party platform. In addition, customers may seek to build and utilize in-house software and service solutions for their ecommerce programs where they believe they can do so more effectively or where they seek to reduce long-term dependence on third-party services for these programs. Existing and new market participants may also introduce new types of solutions and different approaches to enable organizations to address their needs. If the market for our SaaS solutions fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our solutions and our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nOur business and financial results may be impacted by the seasonality of our customers' businesses.\nThe ecommerce marketplace is affected by the same seasonality as the traditional brick-and-mortar marketplace, and many of our customers typically realize a significant portion of their sales in the fourth quarter of each calendar year during the holiday season. Although our customers do not all experience the same seasonal variation, and some customers may have seasonal peaks that occur in periods other than the fourth quarter, the seasonality of our customers' businesses impacts our financial results and may become more concentrated as we continue to expand our solutions to more customers. Historically, the percentage of our annual revenue has been relatively uniform over the first three quarters of the year with approximately 33% to 34% of our annual revenue being generated in the fourth quarter. If our customer base changes to include more customers that experience more concentrated seasonal variation, our revenue may become even more concentrated in the fourth quarter. Any negative impact on the fourth quarter results, and particularly the holiday season sales, of our major retailer customers, whether resulting from negative economic conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other force majeure events, or even unseasonably inclement weather, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nOur growth depends, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to depend on our relationships with various third parties to grow our business, including online marketplaces, other demand channels and other technology and service providers, such as 3PL and fulfillment services providers. Identifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with third parties requires significant time and resources, as does integrating third-party content and technology with our solutions. If the third-party content or technology integrated with our solutions is not well received by our customers, our brand and reputation could be negatively affected. Our agreements with third-party business partners are typically non-exclusive and generally do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. To the extent that any of these third parties compete with us, it could hurt our business and prospects.\nIn addition, a significant number of the transactions that our customers process through our platform are generated from sales on online marketplaces and other demand channels with which we have strategic relationships. As a result, we rely on these relationships with third-party demand channels for a significant portion of our revenue. When a demand channel leaves our platform, not only do we lose revenue from that demand channel but we also lose revenue from customers that have trading partner connections associated with that particular demand channel. In many cases, these demand channels have no obligation to do business with us or to allow us or our customers access to their systems, and they may decide at any time and for any reason or no reason to significantly curtail or preclude our ability to integrate our solutions with their platforms. If our connection to a particular demand channel represents a significant portion of the perceived value of our platform to a customer, our loss of that demand channel may jeopardize our relationship with that customer. Consequently, the loss of a demand channel could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nAdditionally, these demand channels may decide to make significant changes to their respective business models, policies, systems or plans, and those changes could impair or inhibit our customers' ability or desire to use our solutions to sell their products on those channels, or may adversely affect the number of transactions that our customers can process through those channels or reduce the desirability of selling on those channels. Further, these channels could decide to compete with us. Finally, service outages at our demand channel partners could prevent, or severely disrupt, the ability for consumers to make purchases from our customers on those demand channels. In such a scenario, the order volume and associated transaction fee revenue we would have anticipated receiving from those demand channels may decrease significantly, or cease altogether. Any of the foregoing results could cause our customers to reevaluate the value of our products and services and potentially terminate their relationships with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe loss of key personnel or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel may adversely affect our business and limit our ability to implement our business plan successfully.\nOur future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical, sales and professional personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology and ecommerce companies, which may be able to offer more lucrative compensation packages than we can. The replacement of any key employee, such as our Chief Executive Officer, or group of key employees likely would involve significant time and costs, and the loss of any one or more key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives or result in a loss of important institutional knowledge. In addition, our headquarters have been located in Albany, New York since 1997 and, although we have been successful in attracting and retaining high-quality managerial, technical, sales and professional personnel, the pool of available local talent with the specialized skills required for our business is smaller than in larger cities, and we may struggle to find adequate replacements if any of our key personnel were to leave. In September 2017, we commenced a restructuring process to consolidate software development and other corporate activities in our Albany headquarters (the \"2017 restructuring plan\"), which included the immediate reduction of certain positions in our Seattle, Washington office, the retention of certain Seattle-based engineers for a transition period and the gradual replacement of many of those positions in Albany. The 2017 restructuring plan also included the long-term retention of a Seattle-based account services team dedicated to brands and marketplace customers. We may have difficulties finding adequate engineering replacements in Albany and/or retaining our Seattle-based account services team and, as a result, may not realize the anticipated benefits of the 2017 restructuring plan. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nWe have expanded, and may expand in the future, by acquiring or investing in other companies, which may divert our management's attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and consume significant resources.\nOur business strategy has included, and may include in the future, acquiring complementary services, solutions, technologies or businesses. For example, in January 2015, we acquired Mercent Corporation (\"Mercent\") to expand our demand channel offerings and capabilities. We also have entered into, and may enter into in the future, relationships with other\nbusinesses to expand our service offerings, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close.\nCurrent or future acquisitions, investments or new business relationships may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the development of our business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or may expose us to unknown liabilities. In addition, any acquisition or investment may require us to use significant amounts of cash, issue potentially dilutive equity securities or incur indebtedness (which may be on unfavorable terms or which we may be unable to repay).\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of acquired companies, especially if those businesses operate outside of our core competency of providing ecommerce SaaS and SaaS-plus solutions;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from acquired businesses into our organization;\n\u2022\nineffectiveness or incompatibility of acquired technologies or services;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology in order to recoup our investment;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain the key business relationships and reputations of acquired businesses due to changes in management or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nlitigation or assumed liabilities related to activities of acquired businesses, including assumption of liability for violation of law or other compliance issues, or claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\n\u2022\nobligations and/or restrictions assumed under contracts of the acquired business that could negatively impact us;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\ncosts necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls or other procedures and policies for acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nincreased fixed costs; and\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.\nAny of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our ecommerce solutions to customers located outside of the United States, and thus our business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nOutside of the United States, we currently maintain offices and have sales personnel in the United Kingdom and also service customers in Canada and Europe. We intend to continue to expand our international operations as part of our long-term strategy, but any such efforts may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations in new markets will require considerable management attention and resources and will subject us to numerous challenges and risks associated with supporting a rapidly growing business in a cross-border environment, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndisparate government regulations from multiple nations relating to ecommerce and other services, electronic devices, data privacy and competition;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n\u2022\nlimited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\n\u2022\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the United States;\n\u2022\ndifficulty with localizing our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for regulatory requirements and local practices;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity, and the burdens of complying, with applicable foreign laws, regulations and legal practices;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity with local customs and cultures;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards and internationalization/localization requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employer/employee relationships, including recruiting and retaining employees in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates that may increase the volatility of our foreign-based revenue;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, potential double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax (or other tax) systems or due to changes in applicable U.S. and foreign tax laws, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to establish and maintain effective controls at foreign locations;\n\u2022\nthe greater potential for corruption and bribery, which may adversely impact our compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nuncertain political and economic climates;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\noverall higher costs of doing business internationally.\nThese factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs, and there is no guarantee that the financial performance of our operations in international markets will be similar to our historical performance. A variety of factors, including different pricing models and costs related to building out additional operational infrastructure in international markets, could result in lower gross margins, operating margins or cash flow. Any negative impact from our international business efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nOur business is subject, directly and indirectly, to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are continuously evolving.\nWe and our customers are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations relating to ecommerce, privacy, data protection, data security, data retention, consumer protection, antitrust, advertising, intellectual property, manufacturing, taxes, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing, and the scope and interpretation of the laws and regulations that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting.\nFor example, the collection of state and local sales taxes with respect to ecommerce and SaaS sales is an evolving and complex area of law, and an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to require out-of-state ecommerce and SaaS sellers to collect sales taxes on their behalf. We cannot predict whether further state or federal legislation will ultimately be adopted or what form it might take if adopted, and disparate rules, interpretations and positions across jurisdictions could make it more difficult and costly to do business. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case about whether states can require out-of-state online retailers to collect sales taxes on their behalf. If attempts to require ecommerce and SaaS sellers to collect state or local sales taxes on out-of-state purchases are successful, our business and the businesses of many of our customers could be negatively impacted. Similar issues exist outside of the United States, where the application of value-added tax, goods and services tax or other indirect taxes on online retailers and companies like ours that facilitate ecommerce is uncertain and evolving.\nIn addition, there are numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, and foreign laws and regulations, relating to privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data, the scope of which is changing and subject to differing and inconsistent interpretations. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy, data security and data protection, but given that the scope, interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and sometimes conflicting, our obligations could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. It may be difficult for us to adjust our policies and procedures to respond to rapid changes in privacy laws, rules and regulations governing privacy, data protection and data processing in and between certain countries, such as the invalidation of the EU-US Safe Harbor Framework in 2015. In addition, the GDPR becomes effective in May 2018. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the EU that are different than those currently in place in the EU. Efforts to comply with the law may require substantial expense and the diversion of resources from other projects, and non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacy-related legal obligations by us or third-party service providers, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, could result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation and/or negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nAlthough many regulations might not apply to us directly, laws regulating the solicitation, collection or processing of personal and consumer information could affect our or our customers' ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our solutions and services. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit or overly burden our customers' ability to use and share consumer data or our ability to store, process and share data with our customers over the Internet, demand for our solutions could decrease and our costs could increase. In addition, any increased fees and costs for Internet usage or other limits to access imposed by government agencies or by private organizations, which could be more likely following the FCC's repeal of net neutrality rules in December 2017, or regulations imposing increased taxes on the services we provide or restricting information exchanged over the Internet, could result in a decline in the use and viability of Internet-based services, like ours.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nSales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Based on our belief that certain of these taxes are not applicable to our sales in certain jurisdictions, we do not collect such taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales. However, certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to disparate and complex regulatory and contractual restrictions regarding our rights to use data that we process or produce.\nWe are subject to complex and differing regulatory and contractual restrictions governing our use of data that we process or produce. This includes restrictions in contracts with our customers, vendors and other third parties, as well as our privacy policy and other internal policies and applicable privacy and data security legislation and regulation to which we are subject. We rely on data we process and information derived from it to provide services to customers, develop new offerings and, where appropriate and permissible, report on industry trends and elsewhere in our marketing efforts. Although we monitor these restrictions and have procedures in place to maintain compliance, there can be no assurance that our compliance efforts will always be effective, and third parties may seek to assert claims that our use of such data in a particular manner is unauthorized. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves or to determine the scope, enforceability and/or validity of such restrictions or to establish our proprietary rights. Claimants may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than us. Regardless of whether such claims have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:\n\u2022\nhurt our reputation;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our relationships with current or prospective customers;\n\u2022\ncause delays or stoppages in providing our services or developing new services;\n\u2022\ndivert management's attention and resources;\n\u2022\nrequire costly changes to our software and/or business practices;\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant liabilities; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to cease some or all of our activities.\nIn addition to liability for monetary damages against us, which may be unlimited by contract or regulation and which may include attorneys' fees or governmental fines, we may be prohibited from operating portions of our business or operating in jurisdictions that are dependent on obtaining such data use rights unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of such rights, which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake other changes or actions as a result of misappropriation claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers or other third parties for such claims, such payments, changes or other actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe could incur substantial costs in protecting our intellectual property from infringement, and any failure to protect our intellectual property could impair our business.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. In addition, we have sought protection for some of our technologies and currently have registered trademarks in the CommerceHub name and several of our product names. We also\nhave copyright protection with respect to our software code and protect trade secrets through non-disclosure agreements and employee confidentiality training.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Effective intellectual property protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights on an ongoing basis. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions and through additional means, including patent and other filings. These protective measures are expensive and time-consuming, and in the end may not prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property. As a result, we may not pursue these protections in every location where our intellectual property is threatened. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.\nIn some cases, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could be extremely costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, resulting in a diversion of resources. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which could result in the potential impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property.\nDespite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our solutions and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our licensed solutions may be unenforceable under applicable laws. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our solutions and proprietary information may increase.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology and information. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property, then our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nOur lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict our future revenue and cause variability in our operating results.\nOur sales and implementation cycles can vary substantially from customer to customer, depending on the size and complexity of the opportunity. A number of factors influence the length and variability of our sales and implementation cycles, including, for example:\n\u2022\nthe need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe commitments customers make in their agreements with us;\n\u2022\nthe discretionary nature of potential customers' purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n\u2022\nthe competitive nature of potential customers' evaluation and purchasing processes;\n\u2022\nevolving ecommerce needs, budgets and functionality demands of potential customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe length of purchasing approval processes of, and contract negotiations with, potential customers; and\n\u2022\nthe complexity of the implementations and integrations with customer and third-party systems.\nIn addition, with larger enterprise customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. The customer's decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our solutions.\nLengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict the quarter in which revenue from a new customer may first be recognized. Further, our potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers before making purchase decisions. Delays in our sales or implementation cycles could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period.\nWe may have a significant indemnity obligation to Liberty if the Spin-Off is treated as a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, Liberty received an opinion of its tax counsel to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Spin-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to Liberty and to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\")\nor a court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the tax opinion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge.\nEven if the Spin-Off otherwise qualifies under Section 355 of the Code, the Spin-Off would result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability to Liberty (but not to holders of Liberty Ventures common stock) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Liberty or our Company (or any successor corporation) as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-Off. Generally, under Section 355(e) of the Code, an acquisition of the stock of Liberty or our Company will be presumed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) with the Spin-Off if such acquisition occurs within two years before or after the Spin-Off; however, this presumption may be rebutted under certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel described above, Liberty or we might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in ownership of Liberty or our Company, thereby triggering tax liability to Liberty.\nIf, for any reason, it is determined that the Spin-Off does not qualify for tax-free treatment (except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock), Liberty and/or the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock could incur significant tax liabilities.\nPrior to the Spin-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Liberty. Under this agreement, we are required to indemnify Liberty, its subsidiaries and certain related persons for taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the Spin-Off to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code to the extent that such taxes and losses (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by us (applicable to actions or failures to act by our Company and our subsidiaries following the completion of the Spin-Off) or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the Spin-Off as a result of the treatment of the Spin-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of our Company (or any successor corporation). Our indemnification obligations to Liberty, its subsidiaries and certain related persons are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Liberty, its subsidiaries or such related persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off, we may determine to forgo certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to our company, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions, for some period of time following the Spin-Off. In addition, our indemnity obligation under the tax sharing agreement might discourage, delay or prevent our entering into a change of control transaction for some period of time following the Spin-Off.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and/or our customers;\n\u2022\nthe relatively low trading volumes of each series of our common stock; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign economic conditions.\nFurthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. As such, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock and materially affect the value of your investment.\nTransactions in our common stock by our directors, officers and employees could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur directors, officers and employees own shares of, and equity incentive awards with respect to, our common stock. Sales of, or other transactions relating to, shares of our common stock by our directors, officers or employees could cause a perception in the marketplace that our stock price has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our Company. This perception can result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these insider\ntransactions, and the effect could be magnified by the relatively low trading volumes of each series of our common stock. As a result, insider transactions could depress the market price for shares of our common stock.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\na capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u2022\nthe availability of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimits on who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nrequired stockholder approval by holders of (a) at least 66 2/3% of our combined voting power or (b) a majority of our combined voting power together with the approval of at least 75% of our board of directors, in each case with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our Company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nWe may be controlled by one principal stockholder.\nAs of December 31, 2017, John C. Malone beneficially owned shares of our common stock entitling him to in excess of 30% of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of all series of our common stock. Mr. Malone's rights to vote or dispose of his equity interest in our Company are not subject to any restrictions in favor of our Company other than as may be required by applicable law.\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our board of directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our common stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.\nAlthough our Series B common stock trades on the OTC Markets, there is no meaningful trading market for the stock.\nOur Series B common stock is not widely held, with over 90% of the outstanding shares as of December 31, 2017 beneficially owned by John C. Malone, the Chairman of the Board of Liberty. Although it is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market. The OTC Markets tend to be highly illiquid, in part, because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is also a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Markets as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility is attributable to a variety of factors, including a lack of readily available price quotations, lower trading volumes, absence of consistent administrative supervision of \u201cbid\u201d and \u201cask\u201d quotations and other market conditions. Each share of our Series B common stock is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock, which is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \"CHUBA.\"\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, any state or federal court located within the State of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us (including our directors, officers, employees, and agents) and our stockholders, including, among others, any action asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, claims arising pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our bylaws. This choice-of-forum provision may limit our stockholders' ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our bylaws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 16160, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CHUBK"}
