{"cik": "1368365", "company": "REMARK HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary:\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d immediately following this summary. These risks include, among others, the following:\n\u2022We rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders for a significant portion of our business operations. These arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. Any failure by the VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under such contractual arrangements would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022If the Chinese government determines that the contractual arrangements constituting part of the VIE structure do not comply with Chinese regulations, or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, our common stock may decline in value or become worthless if we are unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of the VIEs that constitute a significant portion of our operations.\n\u2022The shareholders of the VIEs may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\u2022The contractual arrangements with the VIEs may be subject to scrutiny by China\u2019s tax authorities. Any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes, and therefore substantially reduce our consolidated net income and the value of your investment.\n\u2022Changes in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions, as well as possible interventions and influences of any government policies and actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and the value of our common stock.\n\u2022Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could adversely affect us.\n\u2022Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditors, and as a result, Nasdaq may determine to delist our securities.\n\u2022Delays in collecting amounts receivable arising from our KanKan business in China could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022The continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\u2022The artificial intelligence market is new and unproven, and it may decline or experience limited growth, which would adversely affect our ability to fully realize the potential of our AI platform.\n\u2022Laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\n\u2022Our continuous access to publicly-available data and to data from partners may be restricted, disrupted or terminated, which would restrict our ability to develop new products and services, or to improve existing products and services, which are based upon our AI platform.\n\u2022Our AI software and our application software are highly technical and run on very sophisticated third-party hardware platforms. If such software or hardware contains undetected errors, our AI solutions may not perform properly and our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022The successful operation of our AI platform will depend upon the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure in China.\n\u2022Our outstanding senior secured loan agreements contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\n\u2022Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\n\u2022Our failure to timely obtain effectiveness of our resale registration statement has resulted in the imposition of liquidated damages and could restrict our ability to raise capital.\n\u2022Our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely against us, materially disrupt our business.\n\u2022We face intense competition from larger, more established companies, and we may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce demand for our services.\n\u2022If we do not effectively manage our growth, our operating performance will suffer and our financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u2022We have a history of operating losses and we may not generate sufficient revenue to support our operations.\n\u2022We may not have sufficient cash to repay our outstanding senior secured indebtedness.\n\u2022Our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s reports for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\n\u2022We continue to evolve our business strategy and develop new brands, products and services, and our future prospects are difficult to evaluate.\n\u2022Our stock price has fluctuated considerably and is likely to remain volatile, and various factors could negatively affect the market price or market for our common stock.\n\u2022The concentration of our stock ownership may limit individual stockholder ability to influence corporate matters.\n\u2022A significant number of additional shares of our common stock may be issued under the terms of existing securities, which issuances would substantially dilute existing stockholders and may depress the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of Remark more difficult, which acquisition may be beneficial to stockholders.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with the VIEs and their shareholders for a significant portion of our business operations. These arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. Any failure by the VIEs or their shareholders to perform their obligations under such contractual arrangements would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe have relied on contractual arrangements with the VIEs to operate our business in China. The revenues contributed by the VIEs constituted a majority of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nThese contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over the VIEs and we face contractual exposure in our investment in the VIEs. For instance, the VIEs and their shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. If we had direct ownership of the VIEs, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of the VIEs, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management and operational level. However, under the current VIE contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by the VIEs and their shareholders of their obligations under the contracts to exercise control over the VIEs. The shareholders of the VIEs may not act in the best interests of our Company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate certain portions of our business through the contractual arrangements with the VIEs.\nIn the event that the VIEs or their shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. For example, if the shareholders of a VIE refuse to transfer their equity interest in the VIE to us or our designee if we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they otherwise act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations. In addition, if any third parties claim any interest in such shareholders\u2019 equity interests in the VIEs, our ability to exercise shareholders\u2019 rights or foreclose the share pledge according to the contractual arrangements may be impaired. If these or other disputes between the shareholders of the VIEs and third parties were to impair our control over the VIEs, our ability to consolidate the financial results of the VIEs would be affected, which would in turn result in a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nIf the Chinese government determines that the contractual arrangements constituting part of the VIE structure do not comply with Chinese regulations, or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, our common stock may decline in value or become worthless if we are unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of the VIEs that constitute a significant portion of our operations.\nRecently, the Chinese government adopted a series of regulatory actions and issued statements to regulate business operations in China, including those related to variable interest entities. These recent statements indicate an intent by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers. As of the date of this Form 10-K, there are no relevant laws or regulations in China that prohibit our Company or any of our subsidiaries from listing or offering securities in the United States. However, since these statements and regulatory actions by the Chinese government are newly published, official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued. Future action taken by the Chinese government could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of our common stock to significantly depreciate or become worthless. In addition, although we believe that our corporate structure and the VIE contractual arrangements comply with current applicable Chinese laws and regulations, in the event that the Chinese government determines that the contractual arrangements constituting part of the VIE structure do not comply with Chinese regulations, or if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we may be unable to assert our contractual control rights over the assets of the VIEs, and our common stock may decline in value or become worthless.\nThe shareholders of the VIEs may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, we are not aware of any conflicts between the shareholders of the VIEs and us. However, the shareholders of the VIEs may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with us in the future. These shareholders may\nrefuse to sign or breach, or cause the VIEs to breach, or refuse to renew, the existing contractual arrangements we have with them and the VIEs, which would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to effectively control the VIEs and receive economic benefits from the VIEs. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause our agreements with the VIEs to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise any or all of these shareholders will act in the best interests of our Company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor. Currently, we do not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these shareholders and our Company. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and these shareholders, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.\nThe contractual arrangements with the VIEs may be subject to scrutiny by China\u2019s tax authorities. Any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes, and therefore substantially reduce our consolidated net income and the value of your investment.\nThe tax regime in China is rapidly evolving and there is significant uncertainty for Chinese taxpayers as Chinese tax laws may be interpreted in significantly different ways. China\u2019s tax authorities may assert that we or the VIEs or their shareholders are required to pay additional taxes on previous or future revenue or income. In particular, under applicable Chinese laws, rules and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties, such as the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, may be subject to audit or challenge by China\u2019s tax authorities. If China\u2019s tax authorities determine that any contractual arrangements were not entered into on an arm\u2019s length basis and therefore constitute a favorable transfer pricing, the China tax liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries, VIEs or the shareholders of the VIEs could be increased, which could increase our overall tax liabilities. In addition, China\u2019s tax authorities may impose interest on late payments. Our net income may be materially reduced if our tax liabilities increase. It is uncertain whether any new China laws, rules or regulations relating to VIE structures will be adopted or, if adopted, what they would provide.\nIf we or any of the VIEs are found to be in violation of any existing or future China laws, rules or regulations, or if we fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant China regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with these violations or failures, including revoking the business and operating licenses of the VIEs, requiring us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restricting our right to collect revenue, blocking one or more of our websites, requiring us to restructure our operations or taking other regulatory or enforcement actions against us. The imposition of any of these measures could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct all or any portion of our business operations. In addition, it is unclear what impact Chinese government actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of any of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements, if Chinese governmental authorities were to find our legal structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation of Chinese laws, rules and regulations. If the imposition of any governmental actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of any of the VIEs or otherwise separate from any of these entities, and if we are not able to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of the VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Doing Business in China\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions, as well as possible interventions and influences of any government policies and actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and the value of our common stock.\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted through our WFOE and the China-based VIEs. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic, social conditions and government policies in China generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position. The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe and negative impact on the Chinese and global economies in 2020 and 2021. Whether this will lead to a prolonged downturn in the economy is still unknown. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFurthermore, our Company, our subsidiaries, the VIEs and our investors may face uncertainty about future actions by the government of China that could significantly affect the VIEs\u2019 financial performance and operations, including the enforceability of the VIE contractual arrangements. Chinese laws and regulations, including the enforcement of such laws and regulations, can change quickly with little advance notice. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations and the operations of the VIEs at any time and may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities. As of the date of this Form 10-K, neither our Company nor any of the VIEs has received or was denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges or conduct U.S. securities offerings. However, there is no guarantee that our Company or the VIEs will receive or not be denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges or conduct U.S. securities offerings in the future. China\u2019s economic, political and social conditions, as well as interventions and influences of any government policies, laws and regulations are uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could adversely affect us.\nThe Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and the enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties.\nIn 1979, the Chinese government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. Since Chinese administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. These uncertainties may affect our judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and our ability to enforce our contractual rights or tort claims. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats in attempts to extract payments or benefits from us.\nFurthermore, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks and uncertainties of the interpretations and applications of Chinese laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the validity and enforcement of the VIE contractual arrangements. we are also subject to the risks and uncertainties about any future actions of the Chinese government in this regard that could disallow the VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, and the value of our common stock may depreciate significantly or become worthless.\nTrading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditors, and as a result, Nasdaq may determine to delist our securities.\nThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cHFCA Act\u201d) was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCA Act states if the SEC determines that a company has filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit such shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter trading market in the United States.\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCA Act. A company will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a \u201cnon-inspection\u201d year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. The SEC is assessing how to implement other requirements of the HFCA Act, including the listing and trading prohibition requirements described above.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCA Act from three years to two.\nOn September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCA Act, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCA Act, whether the board of directors of a company is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCA Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction.\nOn December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determination that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China and in Hong Kong because of positions taken by Chinese and Hong Kong authorities in those jurisdictions. The PCAOB has made such determination as mandated under the HFCA Act. Pursuant to each annual determination by the PCAOB, the SEC will, on an annual basis, identify issuers that have used non-inspected audit firms and thus are at risk of such suspensions in the future.\nOur current auditor has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis, and it is therefore not subject to the determination announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However, if the PCAOB is unable to inspect the work papers of our accounting firm in the future, such lack of inspection could cause trading in our common stock to be prohibited under the HFCA Act, and as a result, an exchange may determine to delist our common stock. The delisting and the cessation of trading of our common stock, or the threat of our common stock being delisted and prohibited from being traded, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.\nThese recent developments may result in prohibitions on the trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, if our auditors fail to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time.\nDelays in collecting amounts receivable arising from our KanKan business in China could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nGenerally, Chinese customers tend to pay their vendors on longer timelines than the timelines typically observed in U.S. commerce, while contracts in China can lack the specificity regarding timing of collection that current accounting rules in the U.S. require to record revenue from contracts with customers. The combination of longer collection times and lack of contract specificity regarding timing of collection could result in higher amounts of bad debt expense, less revenue recorded in any particular period and mismatches between the timing of our cash needs and the timing of our cash inflows that could negatively affect our reported results of operations and harm relationships with our vendors, which in turn could harm our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted our business and could continue to have a significant impact on our business. The impact of COVID-19 on our business and future financial results could include, but may not be limited to:\n\u2022lack of revenue growth or decreases in revenue due to a lack of, or at least a decline in, customer demand and (or) deterioration in the credit quality of our customers;\n\u2022a significant increase in our need for external financing to maintain operations as a result of decreased revenue;\n\u2022significant decline in the debt and equity markets, thus impacting our ability to conduct financings on terms acceptable to us; and\n\u2022the rapid and broad-based shift to a remote working environment creates inherent productivity, connectivity, and oversight challenges. Preventative measures implemented by governmental authorities in China, such as travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and business closures, could significantly impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work productively. In addition, the changed environment under which we are operating could have an impact on our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our ability to meet a number of our compliance requirements in a timely or quality manner.\nThe extent of any ongoing impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and severity of any outbreaks related to new variants of COVID-19, the length of the travel restrictions and business closures imposed by domestic and foreign governments, all of which can be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Though improving somewhat, the situation continues to evolve and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nThe artificial intelligence market is new and unproven, and it may decline or experience limited growth, which would adversely affect our ability to fully realize the potential of our AI platform.\nThe artificial intelligence market is relatively new and unproven and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on the growth and acceptance of this market. The utilization of our platform by customers is still relatively new, and customers may not recognize the need for, or benefits of, our platform, which may prompt them to decide to adopt alternative products and services to satisfy their cognitive computing search and analytics requirements. Our ability to expand the market that our platform addresses depends upon a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value of our platform. Market opportunity estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, including our internal analysis and industry experience. Assessing the market for our AI-based products in each of the vertical markets we compete in, or plan to compete in, is particularly difficult due to a number of factors, including limited available information and rapid evolution of the market. As a result, we may experience significant reduction in demand for our products and services due to lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products and services, decreases in spending by current and prospective customers, weakening economic conditions and other causes. If our market does not experience significant growth, or if demand for our AI-based products decreases, then our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nLaws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business involves collecting and retaining certain internal and external data and information including that of our customers and suppliers and third parties. The integrity and protection of such information and data are crucial to us and our business. Owners of such data and information expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. We are required by applicable privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. and internationally to keep strictly confidential the personal information that we collect, and to take adequate security measures to safeguard such information.\nOur failure to comply with existing privacy or data protection laws and regulations could increase our costs, force us to change or limit the features of our AI solutions or result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others, any or all of which could result in significant fines or judgments against us, result in damage to our reputation, and result in negative effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Even if concerns raised by regulators, the media, or consumers about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices are unfounded, we could suffer damage to our reputation that causes significant negative effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPrivacy and data protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, which could have an impact on how we develop and customize our AI products and software. The growth and development of AI may prompt calls for more stringent consumer privacy protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours. Any such changes would require us to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation.\nFor example, in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") became effective on January 1, 2020 and applies to processing of personal information of California residents. Other states, including Nevada, have enacted or are considering similar privacy or data protection laws that may apply to us. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, also continue to review the need for greater or different regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices, and the U.S. Congress is considering a number of legislative proposals to regulate in this area. Various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. For example, the GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. GDPR would apply to us should we expand our AI business into member countries of the EU. Violations of the GDPR may result in significant penalties, and countries in the EU are still enacting national laws that correspond to certain portions of the GDPR.\nIn China, the PRC Criminal Law, as amended by its Amendment 7 (effective on February 28, 2009) and Amendment 9 (effective on November 1, 2015), prohibits institutions, companies and their employees from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen\u2019s personal information obtained in performing duties or providing services or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the PRC National People\u2019s Congress issued the Cyber Security Law of the PRC (the \u201cCyber Security Law\u201d), which became effective on June 1, 2017. Pursuant to the Cyber Security Law, network operators must not, without users\u2019 consent, collect their personal information, and may only collect users\u2019 personal information necessary to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance for their products and services and shall comply with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under the relevant laws and regulations.\nThe Civil Code of the PRC (issued by the PRC National People\u2019s Congress on May 28, 2020 and effective from January 1, 2021) provides legal basis for privacy and personal information infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. Chinese regulators, including the CAC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Public Security, have been increasingly focused on regulation in data security and data protection.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress of China issued the final version of the Personal Information Protection Law (the \"PIPL\"), which becomes effective on November 1, 2021. The PIPL imposes on China-based data processers (such as the VIEs) significant obligations with respect to, among other things, obtaining, processing and cross-border transferring personal information. The PIPL may subject a data processor to a penalty of as much as RMB50 million or 5% of the preceding year\u2019s turnover.\nThe Chinese regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity are evolving. For instance, various regulatory bodies in China, including the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration for Market Regulation, have enforced data privacy and protection laws and regulations with varying and evolving standards and interpretations. In April 2020, the Chinese government promulgated Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on June 1, 2020. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security.\nIn July 2021, the CAC and other related authorities released the draft amendment to the Cybersecurity Review Measures for public comments through July 25, 2021. The draft amendment proposes the following key changes:\n\u2022companies who are engaged in data processing are also subject to the regulatory scope;\n\u2022the CSRC is included as one of the regulatory authorities for purposes of jointly establishing the state cybersecurity review working mechanism;\n\u2022the operators (including both operators of critical information infrastructure and relevant parties who are engaged in data processing) holding more than one million users/users\u2019 (which are to be further specified) individual information and seeking a listing outside China shall file for cybersecurity review with the Cybersecurity Review Office; and\n\u2022the risks of core data, material data or large amounts of personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, damaged, illegally used or transmitted to overseas parties and the risks of critical information infrastructure, core data, material data or large amounts of personal information being influenced, controlled or used maliciously shall be collectively taken into consideration during the cybersecurity review process.\nCurrently, the draft amendment has been released for public comment only, and its implementation provisions and anticipated adoption or effective date remains substantially uncertain and may be subject to change. If the draft amendment is adopted into law in the future, we may become subject to enhanced cybersecurity review. Certain internet platforms in China have been reportedly subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny in relation to cybersecurity matters. As of the date of this Form 10-K, neither we nor any of the VIEs have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny with respect to cybersecurity matters, nor have we or any of the VIEs been informed by any Chinese governmental authority of any requirement that we file for a cybersecurity review. However, if we are deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator or a company that is engaged in data processing and holds personal information of more than one million users, we could be subject to Chinese cybersecurity review.\nAs there remains significant uncertainty in the interpretation and enforcement of relevant Chinese cybersecurity laws and regulations, we could be subject to cybersecurity review, and if so, we may not be able to pass such review. In addition, we could become subject to enhanced cybersecurity review or investigations launched by Chinese regulators in the future. As of the date of this Form 10-K, neither we nor any of the VIEs have been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the CAC or any other Chinese regulatory authority, nor have we or any of the VIEs received any inquiry, notice or sanction in such respect. We believe that we are in compliance with the aforementioned regulations and policies that have been issued by the CAC.\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of China (the \u201cSCNPC\u201d) promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which will take effect in September 2021. The PRC Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data activities, and introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development, and the degree of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or used. The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data an information.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not expect that the current Chinese laws on cybersecurity or data security, or that the PIPL would have a material adverse impact on our business operations. However, as uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will comply with such regulations in all respects and we may be ordered to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities.\nOur continuous access to publicly-available data and to data from partners may be restricted, disrupted or terminated, which would restrict our ability to develop new products and services, or to improve existing products and services, which are based upon our AI platform.\nThe success of our AI-based solutions depends substantially on our ability to continuously ingest and process large amounts of data available in the public domain and provided by our partners, and any interruption to our free access to such publicly-available data or to the data we obtain from our partners will restrict our ability to develop new products and services, or to improve existing products and services. While we have not encountered any significant disruption of such access to date, there is no guarantee that this trend will continue without costs. Public data sources may change their policies to restrict access or implement procedures to make it more difficult or costly for us to maintain access, and partners could decide to terminate our existing agreements with them. If we no longer have free access to public data, or access to data from our partners, our ability to maintain or improve existing products, or to develop new AI-based solutions may be severely limited. Furthermore, we may be\nforced to pay significant fees to public data sources or to partners to maintain access, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur AI software and our application software are highly technical and run on very sophisticated third-party hardware platforms. If such software or hardware contains undetected errors, our AI solutions may not perform properly and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur AI-based solutions and internal systems rely on software, including software developed or maintained internally and(or) by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our AI-based solutions and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors may only be discovered after the AI-based solution or application software has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for our customers, delay product introductions or enhancements, result in measurement or billing errors, or compromise our ability to protect our customers\u2019 data and(or) our intellectual property. Any errors, bugs, or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe successful operation of our AI platform will depend upon the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure in China.\nThe successful operation of KanKan will depend on the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure in China. Almost all access to the Internet is maintained through state-owned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China. In addition, the national networks in China are connected to the Internet through state-owned international gateways, which are the only channels through which a domestic user can connect to the Internet outside of China. We may not have access to alternative networks in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with China\u2019s Internet infrastructure. In addition, the Internet infrastructure in China may not support the demands associated with continued growth in Internet usage.\nThe failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the requisite bandwidth could also interfere with the speed and availability of KanKan. We have no control over the costs of the services provided by the national telecommunications operators. If the prices that we pay for telecommunications and Internet services rise significantly, our gross margins could be adversely affected. In addition, if Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, our user traffic may decrease, which in turn may cause a decrease in our revenues.\nOur outstanding senior secured loan agreements contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nOn December 3, 2021, we entered into senior secured loan agreements (the \u201cMudrick Loan Agreements\u201d) with certain of our subsidiaries as guarantors (the \u201cGuarantors\u201d) and certain institutional lenders affiliated with Mudrick Capital Management, LP (collectively, \u201cMudrick\u201d), pursuant to which the Mudrick extended credit to us consisting of term loans in the principal amount of $30.0 million (the \u201cMudrick Loans\u201d). The Mudrick Loans require us to satisfy various covenants, including using the proceeds from borrowings under the Mudrick Loans for general corporate purposes in a manner consistent with the identified use of proceeds previously disclosed by us to Mudrick. The Mudrick Loans also contain restrictions on our abilities to engage in certain transactions without Mudrick\u2019s consent, and may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The restrictions include, among other things, limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022change its name or corporate form or jurisdiction of organization;\n\u2022merge with another entity (other than an affiliate of Mudrick),consolidate, or sell or dispose of any material portion of our assets;\n\u2022sell, lease, license, convey, assign (by operation of law or otherwise), exchange or otherwise voluntarily or involuntarily transfer or dispose of any interest in any of its assets (other than upon receipt of fair consideration for\nobsolete assets, trade-ins and disposition, sales or licenses in the ordinary course of business) or any portion thereof or encumber, or hypothecate, or create, incur or permit to exist any pledge, mortgage, lien, security interest, charge, encumbrance or adverse claim upon or other interest in or with respect to any of its assets (other than permitted liens); and\n\u2022directly or indirectly enter into or permit to exist any transaction with any of our affiliates (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary).\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nOn February 25, 2022, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that, for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock closed below the minimum of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days, or until August 24, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If, at any time during the 180-day grace period, the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will have regained compliance and Nasdaq will provide us with written confirmation of such.\nIf we fail to regain compliance before August 24, 2022, but meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nOur common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market during the 180-day grace period, subject to our compliance with the other continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that we will regain compliance before August 24, 2022. Even if we re-gain compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to satisfy our continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market going forward. Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements could result in a de-listing of our common stock. The de-listing could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, customers and employees and potential loss of business development opportunities. The de-listing from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly impact the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nThus, although we may take actions to regain our compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements, we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements.\nOur failure to timely obtain effectiveness of our resale registration statement has resulted in the imposition of liquidated damages and could restrict our ability to raise capital.\nOn September 27, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201cArmistice Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. (\u201cArmistice Capital\u201d) pursuant to which we issued 4,237,290 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $1.18 per share together with warrants to purchase as many as 4,237,290 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.35 per share, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments (the \u201cArmistice Warrants\u201d).\nIn connection with our entry into the Armistice Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with Armistice Capital, pursuant to which we are obligated to file one or more registration statements, as necessary, to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the resale of the shares we issued to Armistice Capital and the shares underlying the Armistice Warrants (collectively, the \u201cArmistice Registrable Securities\u201d) and to obtain effectiveness of such registration statement no later than 90 days following September 27, 2021. While we have filed a registration statement to register the resale of the Armistice Registrable Securities (the \u201cArmistice Resale Registration Statement\u201d), we are currently in a comment letter process with the SEC staff with respect to such registration statement. The SEC has broad discretion to determine whether any registration statement we file will be declared effective and may delay or deny the effectiveness of any such registration statement for a variety of reasons. Our ability to have declared effective by the SEC the Armistice Resale Registration\nStatement will depend upon our ability to resolve the comments raised by the SEC. No assurance can be given as to when the Armistice Resale Registration Statement will become effective. As a result of the inability to obtain effectiveness of the Armistice Resale Registration Statement within the time period required by the Armistice Registration Rights Agreement, we have begun to pay liquidated damages to Armistice Capital pursuant to the provisions of the Armistice Registration Rights Agreement. We are required to continue to pay such liquidated damages (subject to a cap of $1.0 million) until such time as the SEC has declared the Armistice Resale Registration Statement effective or until our registration obligations in the Armistice Registration Rights Agreement terminate. In addition, the Armistice Purchase Agreement restricts us from issuing additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock, for a period of 90 days following the date of effectiveness of the Armistice Resale Registration Statement, subject to certain exceptions, and restricts us from conducting an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering for a period of 180 days following the date of effectiveness of the Armistice Resale Registration Statement. Such restrictions on our ability to raise capital through an equity offering could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software, including software developed or maintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products, delay product introductions or enhancements, result in measurement or billing errors, or compromise our ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property. Any errors, bugs, or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.\nWe regard our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may adversely affect our business and reputation. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our precautions, it is possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving. In particular, the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China are uncertain or do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Future litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely against us, materially disrupt our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our brands and services will not infringe valid patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We cannot provide assurance that we will avoid the need to defend against allegations of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit. Intellectual property litigation is very expensive, and becoming involved in such litigation could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win. Substantially greater resources may allow some of our competitors to sustain the cost of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than us; we may not be able to afford the cost of such litigation.\nShould we suffer an adverse outcome from intellectual property litigation, we may incur significant liabilities, we may be required to license disputed rights from third parties, or we may have to cease using the subject technology. If we are found to infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights, we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or obtain alternative technology.\nIf we fail to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, such failure may materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and could consume substantial resources and create significant uncertainties. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u2022payment of actual damages, royalties, lost profits, potentially treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u2022injunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell our products;\n\u2022us or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all; or\n\u2022significant cost and expense, as well as distraction of our management from our business.\nThe negative outcomes discussed above could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition from larger, more established companies, and we may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce demand for our services.\nThe market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive. Nearly all our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may secure more favorable revenue arrangements with advertisers, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive growth strategies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we do. In addition, the Internet media and advertising industries continue to experience consolidation, including the acquisitions of companies offering travel and finance-related content and services and paid search services. Industry consolidation has resulted in larger, more established and well-financed competitors with a greater focus. If these industry trends continue, or if we are unable to compete in the Internet media and paid search markets, our financial results may suffer.\nAdditionally, larger companies may implement policies and/or technologies into their search engines or software that make it less likely that consumers can reach our websites and less likely that consumers will click-through on sponsored listings from our advertisers. The implementation of such technologies could result in a decrease in our revenues. If we are unable to successfully compete against current and future competitors, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth, our operating performance will suffer and our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSubstantial future growth will be required for us to realize our business objectives. To the extent we are capable of achieving this growth, it will place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. Additionally, this growth will require us to make significant capital expenditures, hire, train and manage a larger work force, and allocate valuable management resources. We must manage any such growth through appropriate systems and controls in each of these areas. If we do not manage the growth of our business effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, as our business grows, our technological and network infrastructure must keep in-line with our needs. Future demand is difficult to forecast and we may not be able to adequately handle large increases unless we spend substantial amounts to augment our ability to handle increased traffic. Additionally, the implementation of increased network capacity contains some execution risks and may lead to ineffectiveness or inefficiency. This could lead to a diminished experience for our consumers and advertisers and damage our reputation and relationship with them, leading to lower marketability and negative effects on our operating results. Moreover, the pace of innovative change in network technology is fast and if we do not keep up, we may lag behind competitors. The costs of upgrading and improving technology could be substantial and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Company\nWe have a history of operating losses and we may not generate sufficient revenue to support our operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, and in each fiscal year since our inception, we have incurred net losses and generated negative cash flow from operations, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $(333.0) million.\nWe cannot provide assurance that revenue generated from our businesses will be sufficient to sustain our operations in the long term. We have implemented measures to reduce operating costs, and we continuously evaluate other opportunities to reduce costs further. Additionally, we are working with our advisors to evaluate strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of certain non-core assets, investment assets and operating businesses. We may also need to obtain additional capital through equity financing or debt financing. Should we fail to successfully implement our plans described herein, such failure would have a material adverse effect on our business, including the possible cessation of operations.\nConditions in the debt and equity markets, as well as the volatility of investor sentiment regarding macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions (in particular, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, inflation and other cost increases, and the geopolitical conflict in Ukraine) will play primary roles in determining whether we can successfully obtain additional capital. We cannot be certain that we will be successful at raising capital, whether in an equity financing, debt financing, or by divesting of certain assets or businesses, on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if we obtain capital by issuing equity, such transaction(s) may dilute existing stockholders.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to repay our outstanding senior secured indebtedness.\nAs of March 28, 2022, $26.3 million of aggregate principal remained outstanding under the Mudrick Loans, which will be due and payable in full on July 31, 2022. Our available cash and other liquid assets, including the current value of our common stock in New Sharecare, are currently not sufficient to pay such obligations in full. If we do not pay the Mudrick Loans in full on the scheduled maturity date, Mudrick will have available to them all rights under the Mudrick Loan Agreements and applicable law, which include, without limitation, foreclosing on the collateral securing the Mudrick Loans. Mudrick\u2019s exercise of any such rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s reports for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nOur independent registered public accounting firm indicated in its report on our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to stockholders, in the event of liquidation. The presence of the going concern note to our financial statements may have an adverse impact on the relationships we are developing and plan to develop with third parties as we continue the commercialization of our products and could make it difficult for us to raise additional financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment.\nWe continue to evolve our business strategy and develop new brands, products and services, and our future prospects are difficult to evaluate.\nWe are in varying stages of development with regard to our business, including our artificial intelligence business driven by our AI platform, so our prospects must be considered in light of the many risks, uncertainties, expenses, delays, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development of business models and products. Some of such risks and difficulties include our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022manage and implement new business strategies;\n\u2022successfully commercialize and monetize our assets;\n\u2022continue to raise additional working capital;\n\u2022manage operating expenses;\n\u2022establish and take advantage of strategic relationships;\n\u2022successfully avoid diversion of management\u2019s attention or of other resources from our existing business\n\u2022successfully avoid impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from acquisitions;\n\u2022prevent, or successfully temper, adverse market reaction to acquisitions;\n\u2022manage and adapt to rapidly changing and expanding operations;\n\u2022respond effectively to competitive developments; and\n\u2022attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nBecause of the early stage of development of certain of our business operations, we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that it will successfully address the risks described or alluded to above. Any failure by us to successfully implement our new business plans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, growth into new areas may require changes to our cost structure, modifications to our infrastructure and exposure to new regulatory, legal and competitive risks.\nIf we fail to manage our growth, we may need to improve our operational, financial and management systems and processes which may require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate new employees, including employees in international markets, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could harm our brand, results of operations and business.\nWe cannot assure you that these investments will be successful or that such endeavors will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible or that we will achieve these benefits within a reasonable period of time.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has fluctuated considerably and is likely to remain volatile, and various factors could negatively affect the market price or market for our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. From January 1, 2020, through March 28, 2022, the high and low sales prices for our common stock were $6.70 and $0.25, respectively. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022general market and economic conditions;\n\u2022the low trading volume and limited public market for our common stock;\n\u2022minimal third-party research regarding our company; and\n\u2022the current and anticipated future operating performance and equity valuation of Sharecare, in which we have a significant equity investment.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. Such broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nA significant number of additional shares of our common stock may be issued under the terms of existing securities, which issuances would substantially dilute existing stockholders and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs of March 28, 2022, we had outstanding stock options allowing for the purchase of as many as approximately 15.3 million shares of common stock. Also outstanding were warrants we issued as part of the consideration for our acquisition of assets of China Branding Group Limited (the \u201cCBG Acquisition\u201d and such warrants, the \u201cCBG Acquisition Warrants\u201d), providing for the right to purchase 40,000 shares of common stock at a per-share exercise price of $10.00 and warrants we issued in connection with a settlement of a legal proceeding we filed arising from the CBG Acquisition providing for the right to purchase 5,710,000 shares of common stock at a per-share exercise price of $6.00 (the \u201cCBG Settlement Warrants\u201d). The CBG Acquisition Warrants and CBG Settlement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis only, such that they cannot be exercised for the entire amount of shares purchasable under the warrants, and they effectively cannot be exercised to purchase shares of common stock unless the applicable market value of the common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price under the terms thereof.\nWe also have outstanding Armistice Warrants to purchase as many as 4,237,290 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.35 per share, and warrants to purchase as many as an aggregate of 127,118 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.35 per share (the \u201cFinancial Advisor Warrants\u201d), which we issued to A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (\u201cA.G.P.\u201d) and its designees pursuant to the terms of a financial advisor agreement (the \u201cFinancial Advisor Agreement\u201d) we entered into with A.G.P. in connection with the Armistice Purchase Agreement.\nThe Armistice Warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the five-year anniversary of the date of effectiveness of the resale registration statement we filed to register, among other things, the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Armistice Warrants. However, we are prohibited from effecting an exercise of the Armistice Warrants, and the holder thereof will not have the right to exercise any portion of such warrants, to the extent that, as a result of such exercise, the warrant holder would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of issuable upon exercise of the Armistice Warrants. The Financial Advisor Warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on the five-year anniversary of the date of issuance.\nThe issuance of common stock pursuant to the warrants described above would substantially dilute the proportionate ownership and voting power of existing stockholders, and their issuance, or the possibility of their issuance, may depress the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of Remark more difficult, which acquisition may be beneficial to stockholders.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d), which may discourage, delay or prevent a merger with, acquisition of or other change in control of Remark, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders, include the following:\n\u2022only our Board of Directors may call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022our stockholders may take action only at a meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022we have authorized, undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval.\nAdditionally, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. We have not opted out of the restriction under Section 203, as permitted under DGCL.", "PERMNO": 89756, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MARK"}
