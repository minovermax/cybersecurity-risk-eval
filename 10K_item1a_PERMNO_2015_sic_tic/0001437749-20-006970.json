RISK FACTORS.\nYou should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report on Form 10- K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our performance or financial condition.\nRisk Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception, we expect to incur operating losses in the future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our incorporation on November 6, 1992. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had operating losses of $25.6 million and $16.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $686.5 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of our common and preferred stock and borrowings from investors and financial institutions.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant research and clinical development, regulatory and other expenses as we continue to develop our product candidates, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our planned or future product candidates, conduct clinical trials on our existing and planned or future product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis. If we do not achieve or sustain profitability, it will be more difficult for us to finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, or other operations.\nThe development of biopharmaceutical product candidates is capital-intensive. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials, continue research and development and initiate clinical trials of our other development programs and seek regulatory approval for our current product candidates and any future product candidates we may develop. In addition, as our product candidates progress through development and toward commercialization, we may need to make milestone payments to licensors and other third parties from whom we have in-licensed or acquired our product candidates. Furthermore, if and to the extent we seek to acquire or in-license additional product candidates in the future, we may be required to make significant upfront payments, milestone payments, and/or licensing payments. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we also expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Because the outcome of any clinical trial or preclinical study is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2021. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our operating plans and other demands on our cash resources may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Attempting to secure additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of, our clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;\n\u25cf\nthe costs and timing of manufacturing for our product candidates, including commercial manufacturing if any product candidate is approved;\n\u25cf\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and amount of the milestone or other payments we must make to the licensors and other third parties from whom we have in-licensed or acquired our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any product candidate is approved;\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products;\n\u25cf\nthe terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; and\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire.\nConducting clinical trials and preclinical studies is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success.\nAccordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through future collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or that may reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur existing and future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition, and if we are unable to meet our debt obligations, including with respect to any collateral requirements, the lenders could foreclose on our assets or seek a judgment against us and execute against our assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $4.6 million in loans payable under a credit facility with O-Bank Co., Ltd., or O-Bank, in Taiwan that we assumed in the CVie Acquisition and which expired on September 11, 2019 and was scheduled to mature in March 2020, or the O-Bank Facility. In March 2020, the O-Bank Facility was amended to extend the maturity date to March 2022, amongst other things. Our borrowings under the O-Bank Facility are secured by a cash account provided by Lee\u2019s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, or Lee\u2019s, however, Lee\u2019s does not have a contractual obligation to us to maintain its guarantee.\nOur debt obligations:\n\u25cf\ncould impair our liquidity;\n\u25cf\ncould make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate cash flow to debt service payments, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate requirements;\n\u25cf\nimpose restrictions on our ability to incur other indebtedness, grant liens on our assets, and could impede us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nimpose restrictions on us with respect to our ability to license our products in the United States, or U.S., and other markets around the world;\n\u25cf\ncould adversely affect our ability to enter into strategic transactions, public or private equity offerings, and similar agreements, or require us to obtain the consent to enter into such transactions;\n\u25cf\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business prospects and could limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our licensing markets; and\n\u25cf\ncould place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors.\nShould we fail to pay our obligations, fail to comply with any covenants contained in any related agreements, including the collateral maintenance agreement under the O-Bank Facility, or if Lee\u2019s withdraws its pledge of collateral to secure the O-Bank Facility, we could be in default regarding that indebtedness and the lender could accelerate payment of the outstanding indebtedness. Moreover, in the future, to secure our obligations under any loans, we may be required to grant to the lender a security interest in some or substantially all of our assets.\nIn the past we have engaged in cash conservation activities and, to the extent necessary, may continue to do so. Such cash conservation management may adversely affect our relationship with our vendors and service providers.\nWe have from time to time experienced periods in which our cash resources have been constrained. As such, it is our practice to routinely closely monitor and control our cash resources to assure that investment and spending decisions advance our corporate objectives at any time. To manage our cash, we tightly control purchasing and retention of consultants, closely monitor the release of funds and may defer payment on invoices to conserve cash. This practice of conserving cash may adversely impact our relationships with key vendors and service providers and the pace at which we are able to advance our programs. While we work closely with our vendors and service providers to preserve our key relationships, there can be no assurance that we will be successful and that our vendor and service providers will continue to work with us, particularly during a period of constrained cash resources. Failure to retain such key relationships could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business and operations.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, recorded on our balance sheet which may lead to potentially significant impairment charges.\nWe review long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in estimates and circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable based on the existence of certain triggering events. Intangible assets and goodwill are also subject to an impairment assessment at least annually. The amount of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet has increased significantly because of the acquisition of CVie Therapeutics Ltd., or CVie Therapeutics, in December 2018. The identifiable intangible assets resulting from the CVie Therapeutics acquisition relate to in-process research and development of istaroxime and rostafuroxin. At December 31, 2019, intangible assets and goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $77.1 million and $15.7 million, respectively.\nIf long-lived assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we would be required to record a potentially significant write-off, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Development and Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates\nClinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results. In addition, our assumptions about why our product candidates are worthy of future development and potential approval are based on data primarily collected by other companies. Our product candidates may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all.\nClinical drug development is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all, and failure can occur at any time during the preclinical study or clinical trial process as a result of inadequate study design, inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols, or other factors. For example, there is not currently data available to show the impact of istaroxime on cardiogenic shock and any studies we may perform to evaluate the impacts of our KL4 Surfactant on COVID-19 is highly uncertain. In addition, we previously had to implement design changes to our Aerosol Delivery System, or ADS, to potentially mitigate the risks of device-related treatment interruptions experienced in the prototype Phase 2 ADS used in the AEROSURF phase 2b clinical trial. Despite promising preclinical or clinical results, any product candidate can unexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical or clinical development. The historical failure rate for product candidates in our industry is high.\nNew drugs in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. As a result, data we obtain from our phase 2 clinical trials may not accurately predict phase 3 trial results, whether due to differences in sample size, study arms, duration, endpoints, other factors, or, in the case of AEROSURF, features of the ADS used. If either or both istaroxime or AEROSURF should fail to perform as designed in their respective phase 3 clinical programs, such failures could adversely affect the results of our clinical development program despite promising results in earlier trials. If clinical trials for any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries will not approve that drug and we would not be able to commercialize it, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if we are required to cease development activities on any of our recently acquired product candidates due to adverse clinical results or otherwise, it could result in impairment of related intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet.\nEven if later stage clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the trial design or sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials or add new requirements, such as the completion of additional studies, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For the foregoing reasons, we cannot be certain that our ongoing and planned clinical trials and preclinical studies will be successful. Any safety concerns observed in any one of our clinical trials in our targeted indications could limit the prospects for regulatory approval of our product candidates in those and other indications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and result in significant additional costs and expenses, require additional time and have an adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales or allow for competition to emerge.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates or the time required to complete clinical trials for our product candidates may be longer than anticipated. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndelays associated with a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, which will impact our healthcare systems and our trial sites ability to conduct trials to varied degrees and times. COVID-19 creates risk of interrupting availability of necessary clinical supplies, local regulatory reviews, hospital ethics committee reviews, site monitors and other necessary travel;\n\u25cf\nour inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial or reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on trial design;\n\u25cf\ndelays in reaching an agreement with the FDA or the equivalent foreign regulatory authorities in other countries on final trial design or the scope of the development program;\n\u25cf\ninability to develop studies that are acceptable in all markets of interest;\n\u25cf\ninability to come to an agreement on clinical trial design or execution factors with potential development partners;\n\u25cf\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u25cf\nfailures or delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining contracts with clinical sites and required institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u25cf\nIRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing their approval of the trial;\n\u25cf\ncompetition with other studies for study patients;\n\u25cf\nchanges to clinical trial protocol;\n\u25cf\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u25cf\nsubjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indication for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndelays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf\nclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u25cf\nsubjects experiencing severe or unexpected adverse events;\n\u25cf\noccurrence of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other companies;\n\u25cf\nselection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;\n\u25cf\nthird-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices, or GCP, or other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nthird-party contractors not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u25cf\nthird-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications;\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate or obtaining sufficient quantities of combination therapies for use in clinical trials or changes in the manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u25cf\ntime required to add new clinical sites; or\n\u25cf\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver a sufficient supply of clinical trial materials or being ordered by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process.\nWe may not reach agreement with the FDA, or a foreign regulator on the extent of our phase 3 programs, the design of any one or more of the clinical trials necessary for approval, or we may be unable to reach agreement on a single design that would permit us to conduct a common pivotal phase 3 clinical development program in all markets of interest. For example, we may not be able to design a study that is acceptable to both the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, regulators, which would cause us to limit the scope of our geographical activities or greatly increase our investment. Even if we complete the clinical trial within our anticipated time, if our results are inconclusive or non-compelling or otherwise insufficient to support a strategic or financing transaction, we potentially could be forced to limit or cease our development activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUse of our product candidates could be associated with side effects, adverse events or other properties or safety risks, which could delay or preclude approval, cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials, abandon a product candidate, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in other significant negative consequences that could severely harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nAs is the case with pharmaceuticals generally, there may be adverse events in patients treated with our product candidates. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Adverse events could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nMoreover, if our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may elect to abandon their development or limit their development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective, which may limit the commercial expectations for the product candidate if approved. We may also be required to modify our study plans based on findings in our ongoing clinical trials. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early-stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. In addition, regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions or require additional testing to confirm these determinations.\nIt is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as the use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by subjects. If such side effects become known later in development or upon approval, if any, such findings may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nIn addition, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may withdraw, suspend or limit approvals of such product;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to change the way a product is distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of a product or be required to conduct additional post-marketing studies or surveillance;\n\u25cf\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u25cf\nsales of the product may decrease significantly, or the product could become less competitive; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation and compliance, which is costly and time consuming, and such regulation may cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and by comparable foreign regulatory authorities in foreign markets. In the U.S., we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval from the FDA. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, as well as the target indications and patient population. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the U.S. until we receive approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, from the FDA.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the U.S. or abroad, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses.\nResults from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways.\nEven if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, as the case may be, may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or may object to elements of our clinical development program.\nThe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nnegative or ambiguous results from our clinical trials or results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies for approval;\n\u25cf\nserious and unexpected adverse events may be experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care or patient characteristics are potentially different from that of the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks or the safety data base may not be large enough;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may not agree that the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are acceptable or sufficient to support;\n\u25cf\nthe submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere, and such authorities may impose requirements for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may disagree regarding the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\napproval may be granted only for indications that are significantly more limited than what we apply for and/or with other significant restrictions on distribution and use;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies; or the approval policies;\n\u25cf\nregulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our or any of our potential future collaborators\u2019 clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission; or\n\u25cf\ndelays associated with COVID-19, which may impact local regulatory reviews occurring in a timely manner and result in delays for trial and site initiations.\nWe may conduct clinical development in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, or EU, Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions and sell our products in the U.S. and potentially in other major markets. To accomplish this objective, we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction. To avoid the significant expense and lengthy time required to complete multiple regional clinical development programs, we expect to meet with relevant regulatory authorities. While we would prefer to design a single, global clinical development program that would satisfy the regulators in all of our target markets, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. If we are unable to reach agreement with the various regulatory authorities, we may not be able to pursue regulatory approval of our products in all of our selected markets.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the foregoing risks, may involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us or any of our potential future collaborators from commercializing our product candidates.\nOf the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or foreign regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. The lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause we have multiple product candidates in our clinical pipeline, we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates, indications and development programs. We also plan to conduct several clinical trials for multiple product candidates in parallel over the next several years, which may make our decision as to which product candidates to focus on more difficult. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates that could have had greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through future collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nAdditionally, we may pursue additional in-licenses or acquisitions of development-stage assets or programs, which entails additional risk to us. Identifying, selecting and acquiring promising product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources expertise. Efforts to do so may not result in the actual acquisition or license of a particular product candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management\u2019s time and the expenditure of our resources with no resulting benefit. For example, if we are unable to identify programs that ultimately result in approved products, we may spend material amounts of our capital and other resources evaluating, acquiring and developing products that ultimately do not provide a return on our investment.\nEven though some of our product candidates have Fast Track designation, the FDA may not approve them at all or any sooner than other product candidates that do not have Fast Track designation.\nWe have received Fast Track designation from the FDA for AEROSURF for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome, or RDS, in infants and for istaroxime for the treatment of acute heart failure, or AHF. Fast Track designation does not ensure that we will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. We may not experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process with Fast Track designation compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation, for reasons such as it comes to believe a drug candidate no longer adequately addresses an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures. If we seek Fast Track designation for other product candidates, we may not receive such a designation from the FDA.\nAlthough we may pursue expedited regulatory programs for a product candidate or an indication, it may not qualify for expedited development or, if it does qualify for expedited development, it may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nAlthough we have received Fast Track designation for certain of our product candidates, we believe there may be an opportunity to expedite the development of other product candidates or indications through one or more of the FDA\u2019s expedited programs, such as fast track, breakthrough therapy or priority review, we cannot be assured that any of our product candidates or indications will qualify for such programs.\nFor example, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Although breakthrough therapy designation or access to any other expedited program may expedite the development or approval process, it does not change the standards for approval. If we apply for breakthrough therapy designation or any other expedited program for our product candidates, the FDA may determine that our proposed target indication or other aspects of our clinical development plans do not qualify for such expedited program. Even if we are successful in obtaining a breakthrough therapy designation or access to any other expedited program, we may not experience faster development timelines or achieve faster review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Access to an expedited program may also be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Additionally, qualification for any expedited program does not ensure that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approval for such product candidate.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain Orphan Drug exclusivity for our product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as Orphan Drugs. In the U.S., Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product candidate that has Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including an NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior to the approved drug. A drug is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for our (i) KL4 surfactant (lucinactant) for the treatment of RDS in premature infants, (ii) our KL4 surfactant for the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants, (iii) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, in adults, and (iv) our KL4 surfactant for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF.\nIf we obtain Orphan Drug exclusivity, we may lose such exclusivity if the FDA or the European Commission, or EC, determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Moreover, Orphan Drug exclusivity may not effectively protect our product candidates from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an Orphan Drug is approved, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if such regulatory authority concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline or data from our clinical studies, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. From time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical studies. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions on marketing or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nFollowing potential approval of any our product candidates, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or other aspects of the directions for use or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or clinical trials to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. The FDA may also require a REMS as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our products will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on product distribution or use, or requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nfines, restitutions, disgorgement of profits or revenues, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals;\n\u25cf\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our products; and\n\u25cf\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue and could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates is approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotion will be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about drug products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for a product candidate, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are currently conducting, and may in the future conduct, certain of our clinical trials for our product candidates at clinical sites located in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. If the FDA and other foreign equivalents raise concerns about certain of the clinical sites based on location and regulatory environment, they may not accept data from such trials, in which case our development plans will be delayed, which could materially harm our business.\nWe are currently conducting, and may in the future conduct one or more of our clinical trials for our product candidates at clinical sites located in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S., acceptance of this data may be subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the FDA requires the clinical trial to have been conducted in accordance with GCPs, and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from clinical trials conducted outside of the U.S. If the FDA does not accept data from our clinical trials of our product candidates, it would likely result in the need for additional clinical trials, which would be costly and time consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of our product candidates.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, our market opportunities will be limited.\nIn order to market our product candidates in the EU or other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain and maintain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies from country to country and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval abroad may be longer than the time required to obtain FDA clearance or approval. Foreign regulatory approval processes include many of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval and we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. FDA clearance or approval does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries. However, the failure to obtain clearance or approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain clearance or approval elsewhere. If we do not obtain or maintain necessary approvals to commercialize our products in markets outside the U.S., it would negatively affect our overall market penetration.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products with claims that compete with our product candidates, it could reduce our sales of our product candidates if approved.\nIn the U.S., after an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d which can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, or product labeling, as our product candidates and that the generic product is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as, or is bioequivalent to, our product candidates. These generic equivalents would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our product candidates would substantially limit our ability to generate revenues and therefore to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our product candidates.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited.\nIf approved for marketing, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon each product\u2019s acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance for any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience, dosing burden and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u25cf\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe our product candidates, and the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u25cf\nefficacy of our product candidates compared to competing products;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, global government payors, private health insurers and other third-party payors or to receive the necessary pricing approvals from government bodies regulating the pricing and usage of therapeutics;\n\u25cf\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement or government pricing approvals;\n\u25cf\ngovernment health care payor imposed mandatory pricing discounting and reductions;\n\u25cf\ndelays in achieving hospital formulary acceptance or limitations of use that are more narrow than the approved label;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of any new products that may in the future become available targeting indications for which our product candidates may be approved;\n\u25cf\nnew procedures or therapies that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications in which our product candidates may show utility;\n\u25cf\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf\nthe inclusion or omission of our product candidates in applicable therapeutic guidelines;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our own or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies; and\n\u25cf\nlimitations or warnings contained in approved labeling from regulatory authorities.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render our product candidates not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve any of our product candidates with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization for that indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals or require risk management plans or a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS and, if a REMS is required, the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our product candidates. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our product candidates.\nWe currently have no sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities or secure a sales and marketing partner, we may not successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u25cf\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or educate and appropriately persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain a competitive share of voice and frequency of meeting with physicians against multiple, larger competitors;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u25cf\ninability to control or influence partner sales and marketing personnel or their prioritization of promotion of our products.\nFailure of our new ADS to perform as intended for our AEROSURF phase 2 bridging study and phase 3 development activities and, if approved, initial commercial activities, would have a material adverse effect on our efforts to develop AEROSURF as well as our other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products, and our business strategy.\nOur development activities are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf\nthe new ADS for use in our phase 2 bridge study that is intended for use in our remaining AEROSURF development activities including our planned phase 3 program, may not achieve acceptable levels of efficiency, consistent performance, reliability and may not be cost appropriate for commercial activities;\n\u25cf\nwe will require access to sophisticated engineering capabilities. We have our own medical device engineering staff and we have worked with Battelle Memorial Institute, or Battelle, on certain development initiatives. We currently are working with Mack Molding Company, or Mack, to complete a technology transfer of our device manufacturing process and expect to manufacture with Mack a sufficient number of ADS to support our remaining development activities. If we are unable to identify design engineers and medical device experts to support our continued development efforts in the future, including, potentially, for commercial use and later versions of the new ADS for use in our phase 3 program, it would have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and impair our ability to commercialize or develop AEROSURF or other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products; if we are unable to secure the necessary medical device development expertise to support our development program, this could impair our ability to commercialize or develop AEROSURF or other aerosolized KL4 surfactant products;\n\u25cf\nthe ADS may perform to specifications in the bench setting and internal tests, however, at clinical sites in our phase 2 bridge study or the phase 3 program with multiple operators of the device, we may experience an unanticipated issue with performance that could have a negative effect on trial outcomes; and\n\u25cf\neven if the ADS performs adequately in the bridging study, additional development to the ADS platform may be required before phase 3 and commercialization.\nThe realization of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our AEROSURF development programs and our business.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities and health insurers establish coverage, adequate reimbursement levels and favorable pricing policies. Failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford prescription medications such as our product candidates, if approved. Our ability to achieve coverage and acceptable levels of reimbursement for our products by third-party payors will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize those products. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the U.S., the EU or elsewhere will be available for any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future.\nThird-party payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement for particular drugs when an equivalent generic drug or a less expensive therapy is available. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider our products as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive product. Even if we are successful in demonstrating improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our products, pricing of existing drugs may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our products. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on products that we may develop.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs will be covered. Some third- party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our products.\nObtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time consuming, costly and uncertain. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs. However, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the U.S. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases at short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely.\nOutside the U.S., international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our products. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Additional foreign price controls, discounts or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our products. Accordingly, in markets outside the U.S., the reimbursement for our products may be reduced and experience continual mandatory price reductions compared with the U.S. and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the U.S. and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our products due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct many of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Any failure by a third party to conduct the clinical trials according to GCPs and other requirements and in a timely manner may delay or prevent our ability to seek or obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are dependent on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies and preclinical studies for our other development programs. Specifically, we have used and relied on, and intend to continue to use and rely on, medical institutions, clinical investigators, CROs and consultants to conduct our clinical trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and regulatory requirements. These CROs, investigators and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct and timing of these trials and subsequent collection and analysis of data. While we have agreements governing the activities of our third-party contractors, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs and other third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and any third-party that we rely upon are required to comply with GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any third-party that we rely on or trial sites fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP and/or Quality System Regulation, or QSR requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nThere is no guarantee that any such CROs, investigators or other third parties will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, adhere to our clinical protocols or meet regulatory requirements, or otherwise performs in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. In addition, many of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of any NDA we submit by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nIf any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third parties or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs, investigators and other third parties involves additional costs and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, investigators and other third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe currently do not have back-up facilities for our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, our suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, our third-party analytical testing and other materials. If the parties we depend on for supplying our APIs and materials, as well as analytical testing and manufacturing-related services do not supply these products and services in a timely manner, it may delay or impair our ability to execute our development plans for our current and potential pipeline products. Such delays could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nIn most cases, we are dependent upon a single supplier to provide all of our requirements for our APIs and materials or one or more of our drug product subcomponents, components and subassemblies, analytical testing and manufacturing-related services. While we are working on second source manufacturing, we rely on single CMOs to manufacture drug product that meets appropriate content, quality and stability standards for use in preclinical programs and clinical trials. If we do not maintain these manufacturing and service relationships that are important to us and are not able to identify replacement suppliers, vendors and laboratories, or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products could be impaired or delayed and our costs could substantially increase. For example, we are currently discussing the wind down of our AEROSURF drug product manufacturing agreement and we are seeking to develop a new process for the manufacture of our API KL4. These CMOs have indicated a willingness to continue manufacturing on an interim basis to build drug product and API inventory to support our planned development efforts, but there can be no guarantee that they will remain willing or able to do so and thus are working with others as a replacement CMO.\nWe may be unable to identify additional manufacturers with whom we might establish appropriate arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, because the number of potential CMOs is limited. Even if we are able to find replacement manufacturers, suppliers, vendors and service providers when needed, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us or there could be a substantial delay before such manufacturer, vendor or supplier, or a related new facility is properly qualified and registered with the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. A new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our approved products after receipt of FDA approval. To qualify and receive regulatory approval for a new manufacturer could take as long as two years. The process of changing a supplier could have an adverse impact on our current clinical development programs if supplies of drug substances or materials on hand are insufficient to satisfy demand. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business.\nWe plan to rely on third parties to manufacture our drug products and manufacture and assemble our medical devices, which exposes us to risks that may affect our ability to maintain supplies of our clinical materials and could potentially delay our research and development activities, as well as eventual regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug product candidates.\nOur manufacturing strategy includes manufacturing our drug products and our ADS, using CMOs.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and related raw materials for clinical and preclinical development, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval. The facilities used by third-party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, third-party manufacturers for compliance with cGMP requirements for manufacture of drug products and QSR requirements for the manufacture of medical devices and other government regulations and corresponding international standards. If these third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, including requirements related to the manufacturing of high potency compounds, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel and the third-party manufacturers may fail to manufacture our product according to our schedule or at all. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. In addition, any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval, and any related remedial measures may be costly or time consuming to implement. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for all required raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates. If our current third-party manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers and we may be unable to replace them on a timely basis or at all.\nOur or a third party\u2019s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements, technology transfers of our manufacturing and our planned future reliance on CMOs exposes us, among other things, to the following risks:\n\u25cf\nan inability to initiate or continue clinical trials of istaroxime or AEROSURF or any future product candidates under development;\n\u25cf\nsubjecting third-party manufacturing facilities or our manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\nwe may implement a plan to execute a technology transfer of our manufacturing process to a CMO and, after investing significant time and resources, learn that the CMO we chose is unable to successfully complete the technology transfer and thereafter manufacture our products in accordance with our plan;\n\u25cf\nCMOs might be unable to manufacture our products in the volume and to our specifications to meet our clinical and commercial needs, or we may have difficulty scheduling the production of drug product and devices in a timely manner to meet our timing requirements;\n\u25cf\nif we desire to make our drug products and/or devices available outside the U.S. for clinical or commercial purposes, our CMOs would become subject to, and may not be able to comply with, corresponding manufacturing and quality system regulations or standards of the various foreign regulators having jurisdiction over our activities abroad. Such failures (such as in-country quality testing) could result in not only a loss of approved supply to that country, but a total loss of a lot (or lots) of materials globally and could restrict our ability to execute our business strategies;\n\u25cf\nwe may have difficulty implementing changes or necessary modifications to our manufacturing processes that may be required by the FDA or foreign regulator or our CMO, if, for example, such changes would burden our CMO or otherwise disrupt operations, or our CMO could impose significant financial terms to implement any such change that could adversely affect our business. We may fail to adequately develop new manufacturing processes. Failure to achieve such required changes or modifications could delay or prevent our gaining regulatory approval for our product candidates or prevent us from continuing to market our approved products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations;\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to adequately scale manufacturing to achieve our objectives for cost of goods and profit margins;\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to disputes arising with respect to the ownership of rights to any technology developed with third parties; and\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to the misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nEach of the foregoing risks and others could delay our development programs and, if approved, commercial manufacturing plans, limit our ability to maintain continuity of supply for our approved products, delay or impair the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA, or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nIn addition, our product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margin and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nOur ability to manufacture our product candidates depends upon receiving adequate supplies and related services, which may be difficult or uneconomical to procure.\nSupply chain or manufacturing interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance. In connection with our drug product manufacturing activities, we own certain specialized manufacturing equipment installed at our CMO. However, we do not have fully-redundant systems and equipment to respond promptly in the event of a significant loss at a CMO\u2019s manufacturing operations. Under certain conditions, we may be unable to produce our drug product and medical devices at the required volumes or to appropriate standards, if at all. The supply of any of our manufacturing materials may be interrupted because of supply shortages, poor vendor performance or other events outside our control, which may require us, among other things, to identify alternate vendors, which could involve a lengthy process, and result in increased expenses.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results.\nThese fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development, regulatory approval and commercialization activities relating to our product candidates, which may change from time to time;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and success or failure of preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners;\n\u25cf\nthe level of investment funding we are able to achieve and apply to our development operations;\n\u25cf\nfuture changes or changes in requirements to achieve regulatory approval;\n\u25cf\ncoverage and reimbursement policies with respect to our product candidates, if approved, and potential future drugs that compete with our products;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of manufacturing our product candidates, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and amount of the milestone or other payments we must make to the licensors and other third parties from whom we have in-licensed our acquired our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nexpenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional product candidates and technologies;\n\u25cf\nour allocation of resources and ability to raise additional capital;\n\u25cf\nthe capital markets stability and openness to investing;\n\u25cf\ndelays associated with COVID-19 which will impact our healthcare systems and our trial sites ability to conduct trials to varied degrees and times;\n\u25cf\nthe level of demand for any approved products, which may vary significantly; and\n\u25cf\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nThis variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings guidance we may provide.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors, which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete.\nOur industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological innovation and evolving industry standards. We compete with numerous existing companies in many ways. We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. If we cannot successfully introduce new products, adapt to changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and potential customers\u2019 requirements, our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer.\nMany of our competitors\u2019 companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technology personnel and managerial resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products, preclinical testing and human clinical trials management, obtaining FDA approval and other regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in receiving FDA or foreign regulatory approval or commercializing products and obtaining patent protection before us. Our competitors may successfully secure regulatory exclusivities in various markets, which could have the effect of barring us or limiting our ability to market our products in such markets. In addition, developments by our competitors may render our drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe also face, and will continue to face, competition from colleges, universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations. These competitive forces frequently and aggressively seek patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for technologies that they develop. Some of these technologies may compete directly with the technologies that we are developing. These institutions will also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel.\nThe political and healthcare policy environment is becoming more challenging for pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers and may adversely affect our business.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences globally are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental challenges that could substantially affect our business and results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing to arise in many countries where we potentially may seek to do business, including the U.S. There is increasing pressure on pricing, reimbursement and demands for value-based data to gain access to patients and healthcare funds globally. This may increase the costs of development, risks of commercialization and overall value of the opportunity.\nGiven the increasing uncertainty in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries as well as increased regulatory scrutiny on foreign investment, capital investment in our industry and our ability to attract capital investment is becoming more challenging. This trend, if continued, may restrict or impair our ability to gain necessary funding for continued development and, if approved, commercialization of our products.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the U.S. or abroad. For example, certain policies of the current administration may impact our business and industry. The current administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict how these executive actions, including the Executive Orders, will be implemented, and the extent to which they will affect the FDA\u2019s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel. If we or our strategic partners or collaborators are unable to attract and retain key personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products.\nWe have assembled a team of qualified personnel to advance the development programs for our product candidates. We have competed and will continue to compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is significant and attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and any failure to do so successfully may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent upon the members of our executive management team and our directors, as well as our consultants and collaborating scientists. Many of these individuals have been involved with us for many years, have played integral roles in our progress and we believe that they continue to provide value to us. A loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business and clinical development and regulatory programs. The loss of services from any of our executives could significantly adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Further, we do not maintain key man life insurance.\nOur future success also will depend on the continued service of our key professional, scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit and retain additional personnel. While we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel at all levels in our organization, many of our competitors have greater resources and more experience than we do, making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel. We may experience intense competition for qualified personnel and the existence of non-competition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to lawsuits brought by their former employers.\nIf our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer, and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we engage in business development activities intended to identify strategic opportunities, including potential strategic alliances, joint development opportunities, acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements and other similar opportunities. Such opportunities may result in substantial investments in our business. Our success in developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for investment, alliance or acquisition; whether we are able to complete an investment, alliance or acquisition on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of our underlying technology, products and our ability to execute our business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the investment, alliance or acquisition into our existing operations, including to fund our share of any in-process research and development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to secure needed capital and expertise to support our development programs and our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may seek to enter into collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements and may not be successful in doing so, and even if we are, we may not realize the benefits of such relationships.\nWe may seek to enter into collaborations, joint ventures, licenses and other similar arrangements for the development or commercialization of our product candidates, due to capital costs required to develop or commercialize the product candidate or manufacturing constraints. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such collaborations for our product candidates because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort or third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy or significant commercial opportunity. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process can be time consuming and complex. Further, any future collaboration agreements may restrict us from entering into additional agreements with potential collaborators. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve an economic benefit that justifies such transaction.\nEven if we are successful in our efforts to establish such collaborations, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such collaborations if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed, the safety of a product candidate is questioned or sales of an approved product candidate are unsatisfactory.\nIn addition, any potential future collaborations may be terminable by our strategic partners, and we may not be able to adequately protect our rights under these agreements. Furthermore, strategic partners may negotiate for certain rights to control decisions regarding the development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, and may not conduct those activities in the same manner as we do. Any termination of collaborations we enter into in the future, or any delay in entering into collaborations related to our product candidates, could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by any interruption to our ability to conduct business at our current location.\nWe do not have redundant facilities. We perform substantially all of our research and development and back office activity in a small number of locations, including our headquarters in Warrington, Pennsylvania, research laboratories at a university in Milan, Italy, which are made available to us under a collaboration agreement, and access to a research laboratory at a university in Taipei, Taiwan under a separate collaboration agreement. We also depend upon third-party manufacturers and laboratories to manufacture our drug products and our ADS and perform important API and drug product release testing and stability work.\nOur facilities, equipment and inventory would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Our facilities and those of our third-party manufacturers and laboratories may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, flooding, fire and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development and commercialization activities for some period of time. The inability to perform those activities, combined with the time it may take to rebuild our inventory of finished product, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. With respect to the analytical laboratory at our headquarters facility, any interruption in release and ongoing stability testing could have an adverse impact on our inventories needed to support our ongoing clinical activities and, if approved, commercial activities. Although we have insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 may negatively impact our ability to develop our product candidates.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. As of March 2020, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, including Europe and the U.S., and has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified and the U.S., Europe and Asia have implemented severe travel restrictions, social distancing and delays or cancellations of elective surgeries. The outbreak of COVID-19 poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting normal business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 globally could materially and adversely impact our operations. We plan to initiate clinical trials for our product candidates in Poland, Italy and other worldwide locations impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. These clinical trials could be materially delayed by governmental restrictions and enrollment difficulties as hospitals reduce and divert staffing, divert resources to patients suffering from the infectious disease and limit hospital access for nonpatients.\nThere is a risk that clinical supplies of our products may be significantly delayed or may become unavailable as a result of COVID-19 and the resulting impact on our suppliers\u2019 labor forces and operations, including as a result of governmental restrictions on business operations and the movement of people and goods in an effort to curtail the spread of the virus. There can be no assurance that we would be able to timely implement any mitigation plans. Disruptions in our supply chain, whether as a result of restricted travel, quarantine requirements or otherwise, could negatively impact clinical supplies of our products, which could materially adversely impact our clinical trial and development timelines.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future. It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could cause an economic slowdown or recession or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, among others. Moreover, the COVID-19 outbreak has begun to have indeterminable adverse effects on general commercial activity and the world economy, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19 or any other pandemic harms the global economy generally.\nFailure in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information and business opportunities.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party contractors maintain sensitive data on our and their respective networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our clinical trial participants and business partners. The secure maintenance of this sensitive information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party contractors are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, human error, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. For information stored with our third-party contractors, we rely upon, and the integrity and confidentiality of such information is dependent upon, the risk mitigation efforts such third-party contractors have in place. Our and our third-party contractors\u2019 respective network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. Such incidents could compromise our intellectual property, expose sensitive business information, cause interruptions in our operations, result in a material disruption of our operations, or require substantial expenditures of resources to remedy.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which will likely result in significant legal and accounting expense and diversion of management resources, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the market price of our stock will likely decline.\nAny failure to maintain internal controls could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. If we do not file our financial statements on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, we could face severe consequences. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, in the future our controls and procedures may no longer be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. Responding to inquiries from the SEC, regardless of the outcome, are likely to consume a significant amount of our management resources and cause us to incur significant legal and accounting expense. Further, many companies that have restated their historical financial statements have experienced a decline in stock price and related stockholder lawsuits.\nThe failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation, including securities class actions, product liability claims and patent infringement claims, could harm our financial performance and business operations.\nOur business activities, including development, manufacture and, if our products are approved, marketing of our drug products and medical devices also exposes us to liability risks. Using our drug product candidates or medical devices, including in clinical trials, may expose us to product liability claims. Even if approved, our products may be subject to claims resulting from unintended effects that result in injury or death. Product liability claims alleging inadequate disclosure and warnings in our package inserts and medical device disclosures also may arise.\nWe face a potential risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any of our product candidates or any other future product. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop, including any of our product candidates, or any materials that we use in our products allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. In the U.S., claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for any of our product candidates or any future products that we may develop;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf\na diversion of management\u2019s time, attention and our resources;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to commercialize some or all of our product candidates; and\n\u25cf\na decline in the value of our stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nWe may be required to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage. However, such insurance is expensive and may not be available when we need it. In the future, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance, with acceptable limits and retentions, at an acceptable cost. Any product, general liability or product liability claim, even if such claim is within the limits of our insurance coverage or meritless and/or unsuccessful, could adversely affect the availability or cost of insurance generally and our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development. In addition, such claims could result in:\n\u25cf\nuninsured expenses related to defense or payment of substantial monetary awards to claimants;\n\u25cf\na decrease in demand for our drug product candidates;\n\u25cf\ndamage to our reputation; and\n\u25cf\nan inability to complete clinical trial programs or to commercialize our drug product candidates, if approved.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nAdverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, potential future product sales and stock price.\nAdverse safety events involving our products under development and our marketed products may have a negative impact on our business. Safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, withdrawal of products from the market, and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician and patient confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nOur activities are subject to various and complex laws and regulations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment. Any failure to comply could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products and our operations are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the U.S. Our drug product candidates and medical devices must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Our facilities and those of our third-party providers must pass inspection and/or be approved or licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection at any time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities could result in warning or untitled letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of our products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our sales.\nIf our products are approved for commercial sale, we will be required to comply with not only the requirements of applicable regulators, but also will become subject to various laws regulating the sales, marketing, and distribution of healthcare-related products. The sales and marketing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA and other federal regulators have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, off-label promotion of products, and other healthcare related laws, antitrust and other competition laws. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies\u2019 sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers.\nOf particular importance, federal and state anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. These laws can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. In addition, a number of states require that companies implement compliance programs or comply with industry ethics codes, adopt spending limits, and report to state governments any gifts, compensation, and other remuneration provided to physicians. Sanctions under these laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), criminal fines, and imprisonment. Companies that have chosen to settle these alleged violations have typically paid multi-million dollar fines to the government and agreed to abide by corporate integrity agreements, which often include significant and costly burdens.\nThere has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. For example, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies with respect to payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as with respect to certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer\u2019s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information regarding all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on medical device manufacturers\u2019 marketing practices, and require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities under certain circumstances.\nWe are continually evaluating our compliance programs, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the requirements outlined above. However, no compliance program can mitigate risk in its entirety. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to our collection and use of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nOur business processes personal data, including some data related to health. When conducting clinical trials, we face risks associated with collecting trial participants\u2019 data, especially health data, in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations. We also face risks inherent in handling large volumes of data and in protecting the security of such data. We could be subject to attacks on our systems by outside parties or fraudulent or inappropriate behavior by our service providers or employees. Third parties may also gain access to users\u2019 accounts using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks or other means, and may use such access to obtain users\u2019 personal data or prevent use of their accounts. Data breaches could subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state and local regulatory entities in the U.S. and by international regulatory entities, resulting in exposure to material civil and/or criminal liability. Further, our general liability insurance and corporate risk program may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nAs our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities, including various domestic and international privacy and security regulations. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. In the U.S., certain states may adopt privacy and security laws and regulations that may be more stringent than applicable federal law. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. We may also be subject to data protection laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, such as the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which provides data subjects with certain rights and requires organizations to adopt technical and organizational safeguards to protect personal data. In the event that we are subject to or affected by privacy and data protection laws, including the CCPA, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and other domestic or international privacy and data protection laws, we may expend significant resources to comply with such laws, and any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA and Switzerland. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including EU Standard Contract Clauses. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other jurisdictions, we could be prevented from transferring personal data of patients or employees in those regions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nHealthcare reform measures in the U.S., as well as the general tightening of drug reimbursement pathways and levels of reimbursement globally, are expected to add additional pressure to achieve financial expectations for approved products.\nIf approved, our products are expected to face increasing pricing and reimbursement pressures from payors globally. Such pressures can impair our ability to access patients in geographies or access certain types of patients - regardless of the breadth of our data or approved indications. Pressure from payors, particularly single source government payors and global price referencing, can result in companies being forced to give greater discounts and/or lower pricing than planned resulting in barriers to achieving financial forecasts or even justifying ongoing or additional investment in clinical development programs.\nOur international operations subject us to additional regulatory oversight in foreign jurisdictions, as well as economic, social, and political uncertainties, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with having assets and operations located in foreign jurisdictions, including our activities in Italy and Taiwan. Our activity in Italy and Taiwan are subject to regulatory agencies, such as the Italian Ministry of Health and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies, and increased government regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nWe may seek to enter into collaborations, licenses or other similar arrangements for rostafuroxin with a third-party to complete clinical development, development of required analytical methods, drug formulation and companion diagnostic test if needed to commercialize the product candidate. Failure of our efforts to prepare for and develop key analytical method to increase the sensitivity of our existing assay, set the stage for successful drug formulation, other related delays, or failure in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval and, if approved, failure to complete development and gain marketplace acceptance for the genetic test could make it more difficult to enter into a collaborations or could harm our reputation or cause product sales and profitability of rostafuroxin, if approved, to suffer.\nWe may seek to enter into collaborations, licenses or other similar arrangements for the development or commercialization of rostafuroxin, including all required analytical methods, drug formulation and companion diagnostic test. We are working on an analytical method to increase the sensitivity of our existing assay to measure low concentrations of the compound in the body. In addition, we anticipate a companion diagnostic may be required as a condition to prescribing rostafuroxin. The companion diagnostic for use with rostafuroxin would identify those patients who have a specific genetic profile who may benefit from rostafuroxin treatment for hypertension. Before approval of rostafuroxin, the licensee would be required to have an analytic method to increase sensitivity of our existing assay and a new formulation. Each of these measures could require additional time and expense for an uncertain outcome. If we are unable to improve our assay or if the third party we engage to assist us is unable to successfully develop a companion diagnostic, if needed, or experiences delays in doing so or if there are problems with any required test, rostafuroxin may not receive marketing clearance or approval.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it could harm our reputation and cause product sales and profitability of rostafuroxin, if approved, to suffer which could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off- label uses. If we are found or alleged to have improperly promoted off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, as our product candidates would be, if approved. In general, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or in ways that may not be consistent with the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of our product candidates, if approved, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical trials of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize our product candidates. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates allegedly cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims may be brought against us by clinical trial participants, patients or others using, administering or selling products that may be approved in the future. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease the commercialization of our products. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf\na diversion of management\u2019s time, attention and our resources;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf\nsignificant negative financial impact;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u25cf\na decline in our stock price.\nWe currently hold product liability insurance coverage at a level consistent with our activities. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product candidates. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies will also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors, may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate: (1) the laws and regulations of the FDA and other similar regulatory requirements, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities, (2) manufacturing standards, including cGMP requirements, (3) federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, the creation of fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in which violations of these laws could result in substantial penalties and prosecution.\nWe are exposed to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Department of Justice, or DOJ, also has increased its focus on the enforcement of the FCPA, particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies.\nIn addition, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that \u201cfails to prevent bribery\u201d by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented \u201cadequate procedures\u201d to prevent bribery. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and any of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers may use potent chemical agents and hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe and any of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers will use biological materials, potent chemical agents and may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety of the environment. Our operations and the operations of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We carry a limited amount of specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty and general liability insurance policies offer limited coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance for certain costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nWe maintain a limited amount of insurance for toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biologic, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which have tended to become more stringent over time. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Matters\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property, other companies could use our technology in competitive products. Even if we obtain patents to protect our products, those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us.\nThe patent position of biotechnology companies is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. To date, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, has not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that is accorded in biotechnology patents or the degree of protection that these types of patents afford. As a result, there are risks that we may not secure proprietary rights to products or processes that appear to be patentable.\nThe parties who licensed technologies to us and we have filed various U.S. and foreign patent applications with respect to the products and technologies under our development, and the USPTO and foreign patent offices have issued patents with respect to our products and technologies. These patent applications include international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Our pending patent applications, as well as those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in the USPTO or foreign patent office issuing patents. In addition, if patent rights covering our products are not sufficiently broad, they may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products and technologies. For example, the core composition of matter patents covering istaroxime have expired. As such, istaroxime relies on data and market exclusivity, as well as method-of-use patents, which may offer a lesser scope of protection than the original core patents. Furthermore, even if the USPTO or foreign patent offices were to issue patents to us or our licensors, others may challenge the patents or circumvent the patents, or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents. Thus, any patents we own or license from third parties may not provide us any protection against competitors.\nThe patents that we own or in-license have a limited life. Certain of such patents related to lyophilized KL4 surfactant have issued in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere and will expire in March 2033. For our aerosolized KL4 surfactant, we hold worldwide exclusive licenses to our proprietary ADS technology for use with pulmonary surfactants alone or in combination with other products for all respiratory diseases and in the U.S. to other (non-surfactant) drugs to treat certain pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions. The ADS patents have expired or will expire on various dates beginning in May 2016 and ending as late as 2037. Patents related to our cardiovascular drug products issued in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have expired or will expire on various dates between 2028 and 2030.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others. Patent applications in most jurisdictions are not published until 18 months after filing. In certain cases, the USPTO keeps U.S. patent applications confidential for the entire time the applications are pending. As a result, we cannot determine in advance what inventions third parties may claim in their pending patent applications. We may need to defend or enforce our patent and license rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others through legal proceedings, which would be costly, unpredictable and time consuming. Even in proceedings where the outcome is favorable to us, they would likely divert substantial resources, including management time, from our other activities. Moreover, any adverse determination could subject us to significant liability or require us to seek licenses that third parties might not grant to us or might only grant at rates that diminish or deplete the profitability of our products. An adverse determination could also require us to alter our products or processes or cease altogether any product sales or related research and development activities.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our product candidates in the absence of such a license. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive practice and companies that may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation. Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on agreements containing obligations regarding intellectual property, confidentiality and noncompetition provisions that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce.\nAlthough we take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property, including the use of agreements relating to the non-disclosure of our confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets to third parties, as well as agreements that provide for disclosure and assignment to us of all rights to the ideas, developments, improvements, discoveries and inventions of our employees, consultants, advisors and research collaborators while we employ them, such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. We generally seek to enter into these types of agreements with consultants, advisors and research collaborators; however, to the extent that such parties apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise concerning allocation of the related proprietary rights. Such disputes often involve significant expense and yield unpredictable results.\nMoreover, although all employees enter into agreements with us that include non-compete covenants, and our five senior executive officers have agreements that include broader non-competition covenants and provide for severance payments that are contingent upon the applicable employee\u2019s refraining from competition with us, such non-compete provisions can be difficult and costly to monitor and enforce, such that, if any should resign, we may not be successful in enforcing our noncompetition agreements with them.\nDespite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:\n\u25cf\nagreements may be breached;\n\u25cf\nagreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach;\n\u25cf\nour trade secrets or proprietary know-how may otherwise become known;\n\u25cf\nour competitors may independently develop similar technology; or\n\u25cf\nour competitors may independently discover our proprietary information and trade secrets.\nPatents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the U.S. or abroad.\nAlthough an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar product candidates. Competitors could attempt to replicate the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around the relevant patents, or develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. We may be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors, former employees and current employees. The laws of some non-U.S. countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents, or patents to which we have ownership rights through licensing agreements, could put those patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of those patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of the patents covering our product candidates are invalidated or found unenforceable, or if a court found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property or may lose our exclusive rights in such intellectual property. Either outcome could harm our business and competitive position.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our product candidates or affect our stock price.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing the patents or violating other proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation regarding patent rights occurs in our industry. Our competitors may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our product candidates. We do not always conduct independent reviews of patents issued to third parties. In addition, patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived, so there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware. Patent applications in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. These applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to develop and market our product candidates. Third parties may assert claims that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization, including claims from competitors or from nonpracticing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect.\nAs we attempt to commercialize our product candidates in their current or updated forms, launch new product candidates and enter new markets, we expect competitors may claim that one or more of our product candidates infringe their intellectual property rights as a strategy to impede our commercialization and entry into new markets. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved, and the uncertainty of litigation may increase the risk of business resources and management\u2019s attention being diverted to patent litigation. We may in the future receive, letters or other threats or claims from third parties inviting us to take licenses under, or alleging that we infringe, their patents.\nMoreover, we may become party to adversarial proceedings regarding our or third-party patent portfolios. Such proceedings could include supplemental examination or contested post-grant proceedings such as review, reexamination, inter parties review, interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO and challenges in U.S. District Courts. Patents may be subjected to opposition, post-grant review or comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign, both national and regional, patent offices. The legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings may be low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can. We may also occasionally use these proceedings to challenge the patent rights of others. We cannot be certain that any particular challenge will be successful in limiting or eliminating the challenged patent rights of the third party.\nAny lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and/ or invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\nstop making, selling or using product candidates or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nlose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments;\n\u25cf\nincur significant legal expenses, including, in some cases, the attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages (possibly treble damages) or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights on which we may be found to be infringing;\n\u25cf\nredesign product candidates that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; and\n\u25cf\nattempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages) and/or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our product candidates unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our product candidates to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our product candidates in a technically feasible way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We could encounter delays while we attempt to develop alternative methods or product candidates. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our product candidates or technologies, we may be unable to commercialize one or more of our product candidates.\nEven if we were ultimately to prevail, any of these events could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity, or prohibit us from manufacturing, importing, marketing or otherwise commercializing our product candidates, services and technology. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we own or in-license is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. In addition, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors view these announcements in a negative light, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information.\nIn addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using commonly accepted physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our product candidates that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome of any such claim is unpredictable. Trade secret violations are often a matter of state law, and the criteria for protection of trade secrets can vary among different jurisdictions. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed or reverse engineered by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents covering our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our foreign patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. Additionally, in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our product candidates, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks, and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nProceedings to enforce our patent or trademark rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nIn the future, we may employ individuals who previously worked with other companies, including our competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property or personal data, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims or settling those claims, in addition to paying monetary damages or a settlement payment, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nRecent changes in U.S. patent laws may limit our ability to obtain, defend and/or enforce our patents.\nThe U.S. has recently enacted and implemented wide ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions, changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and other patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and other patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an inadvertent failure to make payment of such fees or to comply with such provisions can in many cases be cured by additional payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance with such provisions will result in the abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, and the partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents within prescribed time limits. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product or if we or our licensors otherwise allow our patents or patent applications to be abandoned or lapse, it can create opportunities for competitors to enter the market, which would hurt our competitive position and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may be unable to obtain a patent term extension in the U.S. under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation.\nIn the U.S., a patent that covers a drug product or medical device approved by the FDA may be eligible for a term extension designed to restore the period of the patent term that is lost during the premarket regulatory review process conducted by the FDA. Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, it is possible, though unlikely, that one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended, and only one patent may be extended. In the EU, it is possible, though unlikely, that our product candidates may be eligible for term extensions based on similar legislation. However, in either jurisdiction, if we were eligible to apply for patent term extension, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Even if we are granted such extension, the duration of such extension may be less than our request. If we are unable to obtain a patent term extension, or if the term of any such extension is less than our request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be in effect shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. The resulting reduction of years of revenue from applicable product candidates could be substantial.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u25cf\nothers may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidates or utilize similar technology but that are not covered by the claims of our patents or that incorporate certain technology in our product candidates that is in the public domain;\n\u25cf\nwe, or our future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the applicable issued patent or pending patent application that we own now or may own or license in the future;\n\u25cf\nwe, or our future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates before our relevant patents we may have, or to which we have ownership rights through licensing agreements, expire;\n\u25cf\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nit is possible that our current or future pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u25cf\nissued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors or other third parties;\n\u25cf\nour competitors or other third parties might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf\nthe patents of others may harm our business; and\n\u25cf\nwe may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Securities\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not develop, and you may not be able to resell your common stock at a desired market price.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our common stock is traded on the OTCQB quotation system, which is a FINRA-sponsored entity and operated inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities not included in a national exchange. Quotation of our securities on the OTCQB limits the liquidity and price of our common stock more than if our common stock were quoted or listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, or The Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, which are national securities exchanges. Although we have applied to list our common stock on Nasdaq, an active trading market for our common stock may never develop or be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications or technologies using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.\nA small group of investors, including Lee\u2019s, may be able to exercise significant influence over our business strategy and operations.\nAs of April 1, 2020, Lee\u2019s beneficially owns directly and through its affiliates, approximately 35% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and fund affiliates of our Chairman, James Huang, own directly and through affiliates approximately 16.0% of our issued and outstanding common stock. These investors could exercise their voting power in a coordinated fashion to approve any matter requiring shareholder approval by written consent without a stockholder meeting. As a result, there is a risk that these investors could cause corporate actions to be approved even if their interests conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing institutional investors interested in us or a change in control that might be beneficial to our other shareholders.\nWe have applied to list our common stock on the Nasdaq. We can provide no assurance that our common stock will qualify to be listed, and if listed, that we will be able to continue to meet Nasdaq listing requirements. If we are successful in obtaining the listing but subsequently fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of Nasdaq, our securities could be delisted.\nWe have applied to list our common stock on Nasdaq and expect that our plans to meet Nasdaq\u2019s initial listing requirements will be successful. However, we can provide no assurance that our application will be approved. If our application is approved and we become listed on Nasdaq, we cannot ensure that we will be able to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq after such listing occurs, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, and Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchase them.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of many other development stage pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, has been and is likely to be volatile. In addition to general economic, political and market conditions, the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute our ongoing and planned clinical trials on a timely basis consistent with timelines established;\n\u25cf\nresults of our clinical trials and preclinical studies, and the results of trials of our competitors or those of other companies in our market sector;\n\u25cf\nregulatory approval of our product candidates, or limitations to specific label indications or patient populations for its use, or changes or delays in the regulatory review process;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems, especially in light of current reforms to the U.S. healthcare system;\n\u25cf\nthe scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering our product candidates, along with any product modifications and improvements;\n\u25cf\nthe success or failure of our efforts to acquire, license or develop additional product candidates;\n\u25cf\ninnovations or new products developed by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing, supply or distribution delays or shortages;\n\u25cf\nany changes to our relationship with any manufacturers, suppliers, licensors, future collaborators or other strategic partners;\n\u25cf\nour expectations regarding the potential market size and the size of the patient populations for our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe implementation of our business model and strategic plans for our business and technology;\n\u25cf\nachievement of expected product sales and profitability;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in the biopharmaceutical sector and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u25cf\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nan inability to obtain additional funding;\n\u25cf\nsales of our stock by insiders and stockholders;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control;\n\u25cf\nour commercialization, marketing and manufacturing prospects and capabilities;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock, could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders, cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nWe will require additional capital to continue to execute our business plan and advance our research and development efforts. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell shares of preferred stock or common stock in one or more transactions at prices that may be at a discount to the then-current market value of our common stock and on such other terms and conditions as we may determine from time to time. Any such transaction could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders. If we sell shares of our common stock in more than one transaction, stockholders who purchase our common stock may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales could also cause a drop in the market price of our common stock. The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with a public or private financing, in connection with our compensation programs, and upon exercise of outstanding warrants will have a dilutive impact on our other stockholders and the issuance, or even potential issuance, of such shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe exercise of stock options and other securities could also cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution. Moreover, holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them, if ever, at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants. Such exercises, or the possibility of such exercises, may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing through the sale of additional securities or make such financing more costly. It may also reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur securities may be considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). While we have applied to list our common stock on Nasdaq, our common stock is currently listed on the OTCQB, which does not meet such requirements and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in listing our common stock on Nasdaq. So long as our common stock is listed on the OTCQB, if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, such common stock will be deemed penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our securities, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated By-Laws, or By-Laws, and Delaware law could deter a change of our management and thereby discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our By-Laws and Delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us, even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders. Such provisions may make it costlier for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination transaction with us. Provisions that have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or our By-Laws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided, that, this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nPursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its Section 404 reviews, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to maintain effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies, including simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings, exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and certain other decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 82156, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "WINT"}
