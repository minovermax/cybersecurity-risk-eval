RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have historically been a research and product development company. We have a limited operating history with minimal revenue to date, so it may be difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. We also received a going concern qualification in our 2014 audit.\nWe have been primarily engaged during the last eight years in the research and development of our lighting products, and have incurred significant operating losses. During 2014, we focused on initiatives to develop our manufacturing operations with Shenzhen. These initiatives also included continued efforts to work with the manufacturer to refine the manufacturing processes and developing quality control testing necessary for quantity manufacturing. Our progress has been limited, primarily due to lack of adequate funding necessary to execute our business plan. These initiatives are ongoing and, as a result, we had no revenues in 2014 or 2013. We currently depend on third-party financing to fund our operations. We have a very limited operating history upon which an investor can evaluate our business and prospects, and we may never generate significant revenue or achieve net income. Peterson Sullivan, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, in its opinion on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our net losses and negative cash flows from operations and other factors.\nWe have incurred historical losses and, as a result, may not be able to generate profits, support our operations or establish a return on invested capital, which can have a detrimental effect on the long-term capital appreciation of our common stock.\nWe incurred a net loss in 2014 of $3.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of $91.4 million as of December 31, 2014. We cannot predict when or whether we will ever realize a profit or otherwise establish a return on invested capital. Our business strategies may not be successful and we may never generate significant revenues or profitability, in any future fiscal period or at all.\nCreditors have obtained legally enforceable judgments against us on approximately $1.3 million related to the unsecured Convertible Debenture formally held by the judgment holders.\nOn June 11, 2014, four holders of our Convertible Debentures totaling $705,900 in principal plus accrued interest of $218,215 as of December 31, 2014 filed a motion seeking summary judgment with the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The case was heard on July 31, 2014 and the court granted their request and on August 20, 2014 issued a judgment in their favor for the full amount of principal and interest, plus certain expenses. We have made attempt to work with the judgment holders and their attorney to attempt to find a settlement agreeable to both parties, but no agreement has been reached. The judgment holders have the right to levy the judgment on our bank accounts, intellectual property and patents and other assets at any time. In April, 2015 the judgment holders placed a levy on all of our intellectual property, demanding that we turn over our patents, trade secrets, manufacturing methods and other intellectual property.\nOn December 22, 2014, one of the holders of our Convertible Debentures totaling $294,125 plus accrued interest and costs of $77,681 obtained a judgment in their favor for the full amount of principal, interest and costs.\nWe are presently in default on approximately $0.24 million of principal of our unsecured, Convertible Debentures.\nAs of the date of this annual report, the outstanding principal amount of approximately $0.24 million plus accrued interest and penalties under our original issue discount convertible debentures is due and owing by us. We have been in default to the holders of the debentures since June 22, 2013, when the debentures matured. We continue to not have sufficient financial resources, or the ability to arrange financing, to pay the outstanding amount of the debentures at this time. Our failure to pay the outstanding amount when due last year has resulted in our obligation to pay holders interest at the default rate of 18% per year and to pay a mandatory default amount of an additional 10% of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures. Although we have periodically discussed a work-out with some debenture holders, no such agreement currently exists. There can be no assurance that debenture holders have not already or will not in the future take legal action against us to collect the indebtedness due and owing under the debentures or initiate or join in a bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding relating to us. Should debenture holders take any such actions, our company will be seriously impacted and we may not be able to continue in business. See Footnote 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nWe have a number of technology issues to resolve before we will be able to successfully manufacture a full line of commercially viable lighting products.\nAlthough we have completed initial engineering and obtained UL certification of our initial R30 reflector light, further development work and third-party testing will be necessary before the technology can be deployed and production of a full line of lighting products can be commenced. If we are unable to solve current and future technology issues, we may not be able to offer commercially viable products. In addition, if we encounter difficulty in solving technology issues, our research and development costs could increase substantially and our development and production schedules could be significantly delayed.\nWe have experienced delays in executing our business plan, and further delays will reduce the likelihood that we will be able to manufacture lighting products or generate sufficient revenue to stay in business.\nWe have previously experienced delays in executing our business plan. These delays are attributable to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nunanticipated difficulties and increased expenses in developing our ESL technology,\n\u00b7\nunanticipated difficulties in establishing large scale commercial manufacturing, quality control and sourcing processes, and\n\u00b7\nour inability to obtain funding in a timely manner.\nIn the future, we may experience delays caused by these and other factors. Our business must be viewed in light of the problems, expenses, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of new technologies, products, markets and operations. If we are unable to anticipate or manage challenges confronting our business in a timely manner, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe must successfully develop, introduce, market and sell lighting products and manage our operating expenses.\nTo be a viable business, we must successfully develop, introduce, market and sell products and manage our operating expenses. Many of our lighting products are still in development and are subject to the risks inherent in the development of technology products, including unforeseen delays, expenses, patent challenges and complications frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of technology products, the dependence on and attempts to apply new and rapidly changing technology, and the competitive environment of the industry. Many of these events are beyond our control, such as unanticipated development requirements, delays and difficulties with obtaining third-party certification, delays in submitting documentation for and being granted patents and establishing manufacturing and distribution relationships. Our success also depends on our ability to maintain high levels of employee utilization, manage our production costs, sales and marketing costs and general and administrative expenses, and otherwise execute on our business plan. We may not be able to effectively and efficiently manage our development and growth. Any inability to do so could increase our expenses and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely solely on third party manufacturers to manufacture the ESL lighting products we sell to customers and to source the required raw materials.\nOur business prospects depend significantly on our ability to obtain ESL lighting products for sale to our customers. Our manufacturing agreement with our manufacturing partner provided us with a single source for our ESL lights. Through this agreement, Shenzhen is responsible for fabricating the required electronic components of our lights, sourcing the glass components from its suppliers and using its established automated processes to assemble and package finished products. Our outsourced manufacturing partner is located in the People\u2019s Republic of China, where shipments of product to us could be delayed, rerouted, lost or damaged. Our inability to obtain finished products from our third party manufacturer in accordance with our required technical specifications and on a timely basis due to shipping delays, manufacturing problems or its failure to obtain required raw materials would have a material adverse effect on our revenue from product sales, as well as on our ability to support our customers\u2019 purchase requirements, which could result in loss of customers and damage to our reputation. We may also be subject to the risk of fluctuations in raw material prices, since our arrangement with our manufacturing partner provides that increases and decreases in the prices will affect the negotiated prices of purchase orders placed.\nWe may face additional barriers and tariffs as a result of importing our lighting products from China, which could increase our prices and make our products less desirable.\nWe expect to pay a duty on all lighting products that we import from China. This duty is expected to represent a 3.9% mark-up to factory invoice. We will also bear related importing costs such as customs inspection fees and ocean freight charges. In the future, China and the United States may create additional barriers to business between our China-based product manufacturer and us, including new tariffs, costs, restrictions, controls or embargos that could negatively impact our business and operating results. New or increased tariffs would likely result in higher prices (and potentially lower sales volumes) and lower operating margins on our products.\nWe rely heavily on a few consultants, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur future success will depend in significant part upon the continued services of our executive officers and directors and certain key consultants, and our ability to attract, assimilate and retain highly qualified technical, managerial and sales and marketing personnel when needed. Competition for quality personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain our existing key personnel or that we will be able to attract, assimilate and retain such employees in the future when needed. The loss of key personnel or the inability to hire, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on outside vendors to manage certain key business processes, and any failure by them to perform will negatively affect our business.\nWe have outsourced certain of our key business processes. If any of our service providers fail to perform at a satisfactory level, our business development will be negatively affected and delayed, and our reputation may be harmed.\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict; thus, the future of our business is uncertain.\nDue to our limited operating history and the significant development and manufacturing objectives that we must achieve to be successful, our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and are expected to vary significantly from period to period. In addition, the amount and duration of losses will be extended if we are unable to develop and manufacture our products in a timely manner. Factors that could inhibit our product development, manufacturing and future operating results include:\n\u00b7\nfailure to solve existing or future technology-related issues in a timely manner,\n\u00b7\nfailure to obtain sufficient financing when needed,\n\u00b7\nfailure to secure key manufacturing or other strategic business relationships, and\n\u00b7\ncompetitive factors, including the introduction of new products, product enhancements and the introduction of new or improved technologies by our competitors, the entry of new competitors into the lighting markets and pricing pressures.\nWe face currency risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency valuations.\nAlthough we use U.S. dollars to pay our outsourced manufacturing partner, increases in the value of the Chinese Yuan Renminbi would have an adverse affect on their manufacturing costs and therefore our bulb cost may be adversely affected. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency contracts or other currency-related derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nBecause we are smaller and have fewer financial resources than most of our competitors, we may not be able to successfully compete in the very competitive lighting industry.\nThe lighting industry is very competitive and we expect this competition to continue to increase. The general illumination market segment within the lighting industry is dominated by a number of well-funded multi-national companies such as General Electric Company, Phillips Electronics NV and Osram Sylvania, that have established products and are developing new products that compete with our current and planned lighting products. We may not be able to compete effectively against these or other competitors, most of whom have substantially greater financial resources and operating experience than we do. Many of our current and future competitors may have advantages over us, including:\n\u00b7\nwell established products that dominate the market,\n\u00b7\nlonger operating histories,\n\u00b7\nestablished customer bases,\n\u00b7\nsubstantially greater financial resources,\n\u00b7\nwell established and significantly greater technical, research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing resources, capabilities and experience, and\n\u00b7\ngreater name recognition.\nOur current and potential competitors have established, and may continue to establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that would increase their market dominance and negatively impact our ability to compete with them. In addition, competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs, or to devote more resources to promoting and selling their products. If we fail to adapt to market demands and to compete successfully with existing and new competitors, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The market for lighting technology is changing rapidly and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete, especially in light of our limited resources. There can be no assurance that any of our current or planned lighting products can compete successfully on a cost, quality or market acceptance basis with competitors\u2019 products and technologies.\nWe depend on our intellectual property. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be unable to compete and our business may fail.\nOur success and ability to develop our technology and create products and become competitive depend to a significant degree on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, particularly any patentable material. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to preserve our rights to our technology. In addition, any intellectual property protection we seek may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nWe do not currently have sufficient available resources to defend a lawsuit challenging our intellectual property rights or to prosecute others who may be infringing our rights. Accordingly, even if we have strong intellectual property rights and patent rights, we may not be able to afford to engage in the necessary litigation to enforce our rights.\nIn April, 2015 certain judgment holders placed a levy on all of our intellectual property, demanding that we turn over our patents, trade secrets, manufacturing methods and other intellectual property.\nWe compete in industries where competitors pursue patent prosecution worldwide and patent litigation is customary. At any given time, there may be one or more patent applications filed or patents that are the subject of litigation, which, if granted or upheld, could impair our ability to conduct our business without first obtaining licenses or granting cross-licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We have several patent applications pending in the United States and internationally and we expect to file additional patent applications; however, none of these patents may ever be issued. We do not perform worldwide patent searches as a matter of custom and, at any given time, there could be patent applications pending or patents issued that may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us, and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and could result in the loss of significant rights. If there is a successful claim of infringement, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we could be required to cease selling any of our products that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Successful claims of intellectual property infringement against us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even successful defense and prosecution of patent suits is costly and time consuming.\nWe rely in part on unpatented proprietary technology, and others may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of those trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. In particular, we may not be able to protect our proprietary information as we conduct discussions with potential strategic partners. If we are unable to protect the proprietary nature of our technologies, it may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain and maintain industry certification for our lighting products could cause an erosion of our current competitive strengths.\nWe are designing our lighting products to be UL or ETL (an Intertek listed mark for product compliance to North American safety standards) compliant and intend to seek Energy Star certification, as well as appropriate certifications in the European Union and in other countries. UL or ETL compliance certification is a key standard in the lighting industry, and if we fail to obtain or maintain this standard we may not have any market interest for our products. We may not obtain this certification or we may be required to make changes to our lights, which would delay our commercialization efforts and would negatively harm our business and our results of operations.\nRapid technological changes and evolving industry standards could result in our lighting products becoming obsolete and no longer in demand.\nThe lighting industry is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards and is highly competitive with respect to timely product innovation. The introduction of lighting products embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products and technologies obsolete and unmarketable. Our success will depend in part on our ability to successfully develop commercial applications for our technology, anticipate and respond to technology developments and changes in industry standards, and obtain market acceptance on any products we introduce. We may not be successful in the development of our ESL technology, and we may encounter technical or other serious difficulties in our development or commercialization efforts that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nEnsuring that we have effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be frequently evaluated. As a public company, we conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a smaller reporting company, we are not currently required to receive a report from our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. As we grow, it may be necessary in the future to update our internal controls over financial reporting on the basis of periodic reviews. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we (or our independent registered public accounting firm) identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that could rise to the level of a material weakness, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective. If we are unable to assert that they are effective (or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable in the future to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting), we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, our business, reputation, financial position and results of operation. In addition, we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct any material weaknesses that may be identified or to respond to any regulatory investigations or proceedings.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nOur historic stock price has been volatile and the future market price for our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. This may make it difficult for you to sell our common stock for a positive return on your investment.\nThe public market for our common stock has historically been volatile. Any future market price for our shares is likely to continue to be volatile. This price volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell shares when you want at prices you find attractive. The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific companies. Broad market factors and the investing public\u2019s negative perception of our business may reduce our stock price, regardless of our operating performance. Further, the market for our common stock is limited and we cannot assure you that a larger market will ever be developed or maintained. Market fluctuations and volatility, as well as general economic, market and political conditions, could reduce our market price. As a result, these factors may make it more difficult or impossible for you to sell our common stock for a positive return on your investment.\nOur management and SAM Special Opportunities Fund, L.P. own a substantial amount of our stock and are capable of influencing our affairs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our executive officers and directors (and their respective affiliates) beneficially owned approximately 16.3% of our outstanding common stock, with SAM Advisors, LLC, an investment advisor controlled by William B. Smith, our Chairman, beneficially owning approximately 8.1% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these shareholders substantially influence our management and affairs and, if acting together, control most matters requiring the approval by our shareholders including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant corporate transactions. The concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control at a premium price.\nOur articles of incorporation contain authorized, unissued preferred stock which, if issued, may inhibit a takeover at a premium price that may be beneficial to you.\nOur articles of incorporation allow us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock without further stockholder approval and upon such terms and conditions, and having such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as the board of directors may determine. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of, or of discouraging bids for control of our company. This could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nShares of stock issuable pursuant to our stock options, warrants, convertible debentures and underwriters\u2019 warrants may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have outstanding under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan stock options to purchase 829,936 shares of common stock, outstanding warrants to purchase 6,222,228 shares of common stock and outstanding convertible debentures to acquire 1,304,631 shares of common stock. The exercise or conversion of these securities and sales of common stock issuable pursuant to them, would reduce a stockholder\u2019s percentage voting and ownership interest.\nThe stock options, warrants and convertible debentures are likely to be exercised when our common stock is trading at a price that is higher than the exercise or conversion price of these securities, and we would be able to obtain a higher price for our common stock than we will receive under such securities. The exercise or conversion, or potential exercise or conversion, of these stock options, warrants and convertible debentures could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the terms on which we could obtain additional financing, if needed.\nThe large number of shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe sale, or availability for sale, of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities. At December 31, 2014, there were 12,950,384 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Of these shares, approximately 12,187,734 are freely transferable. Our executive officers and directors beneficially own 2,304,174 shares, which would be eligible for resale, subject to the volume and manner of sale limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. An additional 762,650 shares are \u201crestricted shares,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144, and are eligible for sale under the provisions of Rule 144.\nOur common stock is currently considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and may be difficult to sell unless we obtain a Nasdaq listing.\nOur common stock is subject to certain rules and regulations relating to \u201cpenny stock.\u201d A \u201cpenny stock\u201d is generally defined as any equity security that has a price less than $5.00 per share and that is not quoted on a national securities exchange such as Nasdaq. Being a penny stock generally means that any broker who wants to trade in our shares (other than with established clients and certain institutional investors) must comply with certain \u201csales practice requirements,\u201d including delivery to the prospective purchaser of the penny stock a risk disclosure document describing the penny stock market and the risks associated with it. These penny stock rules make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend our common stock and, as a result, our stockholders may have difficulty in selling their shares in the secondary trading market. This lack of liquidity may also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future through the sale of our equity securities.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock, so any return on investment must come from appreciation.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to invest all future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, any investment return in our common stock must come from increases in the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 84270, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "VUOC"}
