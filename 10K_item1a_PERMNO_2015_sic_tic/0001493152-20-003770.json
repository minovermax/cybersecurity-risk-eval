RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our other public filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those we currently believe to be material, but they are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider not to be material, actually occur or become material risks, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company formed in October 2016 and have a limited operating history. We do not lease or own any corporate office or laboratory space and our employees all work remotely. We outsource our manufacturing, clinical trial, information technology, payroll, legal and certain other functions.\nWe have acquired or in-licensed five clinical stage assets and a late stage preclinical enteroviral vaccine platform as described herein, which will be our product candidates unless we in-license or acquire additional development assets. Marketing approval of our product candidates will require extensive clinical testing data to support safety and efficacy requirements, as well as pharmaceutical development, manufacturing and preclinical data, all of which are needed for regulatory approval. The likelihood of success of our business plan must be considered in light of the challenges, substantial expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with developing and expanding early-stage businesses and the regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking, involves a substantial degree of risk, and is a capital-intensive business.\nAccordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, especially clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies such as ours. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a company with a limited operating history will face. In particular, you should consider that we cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u25cf successfully implement or execute our current business plan, or that our business plan is sound;\n\u25cf successfully start and complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of our product candidates;\n\u25cf successfully contract for the manufacture of our clinical drug products and establish a commercial drug supply;\n\u25cf secure market exclusivity and/or adequate intellectual property protection for our product candidates;\n\u25cf attract and retain an experienced management and advisory team;\n\u25cf raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate our business plan, including clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization for our product candidates;\n\u25cf successfully recruit and retain a sales and marketing organization;\n\u25cf successfully launch teplizumab in the U.S. ourselves; and\n\u25cf successfully establish a strategic partnership to launch teplizumab outside the U.S.\nIf we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed, and your investment will be adversely affected.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses and may never become profitable or be able to sustain profitability.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses without corresponding revenues unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize our product candidates. We expect to incur significant expense to complete our clinical programs for our product candidates in the United States and elsewhere. We may never be able to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of our product candidates in any indication in the United States or internationally. Even if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, there can be no assurance that we will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability.\nWe expect to have significant research and development expenses as we advance clinical trials for our product candidates. As a result, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will be increasing. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable may impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect our business and our ability to raise capital.\nWe need to raise additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate certain or all of our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our operating costs to be substantial as we incur costs related to our expected BLA submission for PRV-031 for the At-Risk indication, costs to support our commercialization efforts for PRV-031, including costs related to the buildout of an internal commercial infrastructure, and our ongoing and planned clinical trials for PRV-031 and our other product candidates. We will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future or until such time as we obtain regulatory approval for and execute a successful commercial launch of teplizumab. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a net loss of $43.3 million and $26.8 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $79.1 million and $85.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund projected operating requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will need substantial additional capital to fund the clinical development program for all of our product candidates. In particular, we will need additional capital to fund the completion of the PROTECT study, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of PRV-031 in type 1 diabetes, or T1D, commenced in the second quarter of 2019 with top-line data, based on current estimates, not available until 2022, including to produce additional drug supply in order to complete the PROTECT study.\nWe do not have any prospective financing arrangements or credit facilities as a source of future funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private equity offerings, public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, could increase our expenses and could require that our assets secure such debt. Moreover, any debt we incur must be repaid regardless of our operating results. If we choose to pursue additional indications and/or geographies for our product candidates, in-license or acquire additional development assets, or otherwise expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate, we may also need to raise additional capital sooner than expected.\nIf we do not raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may need to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or cease operations altogether, or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or any future product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will adequately support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.\nOur operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf the success of our development strategy;\n\u25cf the time, resources, and expense required to develop and conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u25cf the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u25cf the cost of manufacturing and maintaining sufficient inventories of our products to meet anticipated demand;\n\u25cf any product liability or other lawsuits related to our product candidates and the costs associated with defending them or the results of such lawsuits;\n\u25cf the cost of growing our ongoing development operations and establishing commercialization operations;\n\u25cf the cost to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations;\n\u25cf the costs associated with being a public company; and\n\u25cf the costs associated with commercialization.\nAny material increases in our operating expenses will have a material impact on our financial condition and business operations. In addition, if we are unable to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, we may need to raise additional capital or delay or cease development of one or more of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval, Manufacturing and Commercialization\nThe results of the PRV-031 CMC comparability plan may be unacceptable to the regulatory authorities. This may require further CMC development activities and could affect the timing of BLA submission.\nIn November 2019, we completed a Type B multidisciplinary meeting with the FDA to discuss the proposed contents of a BLA for PRV-031 (teplizumab) for the prevention or delay of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in individuals at-risk of developing T1D. Based on official FDA meeting minutes, we do not anticipate the need to conduct any additional clinical trials in the at-risk population prior to BLA submission. However, for the CMC module, the FDA confirmed that it would require the demonstration of comparability between the study drug previously manufactured by MacroGenics and Eli Lilly and the to-be-commercialized drug substance and drug product scheduled for production by Provention and its contract manufacturing partners.\nIf we are unable to demonstrate the ability to manufacture drug substance and drug product that is comparable to the study drug previously manufactured by MacroGenics and Eli Lilly, the timing of the PRV-031 BLA submission could be delayed, which could have a material impact on our business.\nWe depend entirely on the success of our product candidates, one of which did not meet its primary endpoint in a prior Phase 3 clinical trial and two of which have not yet demonstrated efficacy for their target indication or any other indications in Phase 2 clinical trials. If we are unable to generate revenues from our product candidates, our ability to create stockholder value will be limited.\nOur product candidates are either in various stages of clinical development or late stages of preclinical development. We do not generate revenues from any approved drug products. We are or will be conducting human clinical trials of our product candidates.\nOur clinical trial of PRV-031 in T1D is currently being conducted in the United States. We plan to add sites in Canada and European countries. PRV-031 has an active Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, the foreign equivalent of an IND. We are in the process of submitting CTAs in all intended countries.\nOur Phase 2b clinical trial of PRV-015 in non-responsive celiac disease will be conducted in the United States, Canada and European Union countries. PRV-015 has an active IND with the U.S. FDA, and we will file CTAs in all intended countries upon completion of on-going toxicology studies.\nWe have submitted amendments to the IND for PRV-3279 for clinical development in B-cell directed immune diseases, and plan to file the appropriate documentation to the IND as well as CTAs for the planned Phase 2a study in lupus, now that the Phase 1b study has been completed.\nWe plan on submitting a CTA to the Finnish Medicines Agency (Fimea), seeking approval to initiate a First-in-Human Phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy adult volunteers for our coxsackie B virus, or CVB, vaccine (PRV-101) for the prevention of acute CVB infection, which has been linked to the development of T1D and T1D-associated celiac disease.\nWe will be required to submit our clinical trial protocols and receive approvals from the regulatory authorities before we can commence any clinical trials with PRV-101 and PRV-015, and any additional studies with PRV-3279. Nonclinical study results for our product candidates, including toxicology studies, may not support the filing of an IND or foreign equivalent for the product candidate.\nMoreover, we may not be successful in obtaining acceptance from the regulatory authorities to start our clinical trials. If we do not obtain such acceptance, the time in which we expect to commence clinical programs for any product candidate will be extended and such extension will increase our expenses and increase our need for additional capital.\nThere is no guarantee that our clinical trials will be successful or that we will continue clinical development in support of an approval from the regulatory authorities for any indication. We note that most drug candidates never reach the clinical development stage and even those that do commence clinical development have only a small chance of successfully completing clinical development and gaining regulatory approval.\nOur business currently depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, to successfully commercialize our product candidates, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in completing our clinical trials which in turn will require additional costs, or we may fail to demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nIt is impossible to predict if or when any of our product candidates will prove safe or effective in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u25cf delays in reaching, or failing to reach, a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;\n\u25cf delays in reaching, or failing to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with a sufficient number of prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board, or IRB or Ethics Committee (EC) approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u25cf delays in recruiting a sufficient number of suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf failure by our CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical trial, regulatory or legal requirements;\n\u25cf failure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practices, or GCP, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u25cf delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of sufficient quantities of our product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u25cf delays in having patients\u2019 complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf clinical study sites or patients dropping out of a study;\n\u25cf delay or failure to address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs or increases in costs of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u25cf occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; or\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs or ECs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board, or SRB, for such trial or by the FDA, EMA, or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA, EMA, or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions.\nClinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Further, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval. If the results of our clinical trials are inconclusive or if there are safety concerns or adverse events associated with our other product candidates, we may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates, if approved at all;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u25cf be required to change the way the product is administered;\n\u25cf be required to perform additional preclinical or clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u25cf have regulatory authorities withdraw their approval of a product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u25cf be sued; or\n\u25cf experience damage to our reputation.\nAdditionally, our product candidates could potentially cause other adverse events that have not yet been predicted. The inclusion of ill patients in our clinical trials may result in deaths or other adverse medical events due to other therapies or medications that such patients may be using. As described above, any of these events could prevent us from obtaining marketing approval or achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates and impair our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe have conducted and are conducting clinical trials outside the United States and anticipate conducting additional clinical trials outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nWe are currently conducting clinical trials for our product candidates in countries outside of the United States and we anticipate that we will conduct additional clinical trials in countries outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of such study data by the FDA is subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are considered applicable to the U.S. patient population and U.S. medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data is considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. In addition, such clinical trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the clinical trials are conducted. A description of any studies related to overdosage is also required, including information on dialysis, antidotes, or other treatments, if known. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from clinical trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept any such data, it would likely result in the need for additional clinical trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our development plan.\nRisks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf foreign regulatory requirements that could burden or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u25cf administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple foreign regulatory schema;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations which could negatively impact our financial condition since certain payments are paid in local currencies;\n\u25cf manufacturing, customs, shipment and storage requirements;\n\u25cf cultural differences in medical practice and clinical research; and\n\u25cf diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing of drug product candidates is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of pre-clinical trials and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. We cannot assure you that the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will view the results as we do or that any future trials of any of our product candidates will achieve positive results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Any future clinical trial results for our product candidates may not be successful.\nIn addition, a number of factors could contribute to a lack of favorable safety and efficacy results for any of our product candidates. For example, such trials could result in increased variability due to varying site characteristics, such as local standards of care, differences in evaluation period and surgical technique, and due to varying patient characteristics including demographic factors and health status.\nIf we are not able to obtain any required regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be limited.\nWe must successfully complete clinical trials for our product candidates before we can apply for marketing approval. Even if we complete our clinical trials, it does not assure marketing approval. Our clinical trials may be unsuccessful, which would materially harm our business. Even if our initial clinical trials are successful, we are required to conduct additional clinical trials to establish our product candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy, before a marketing application (New Drug Application, or NDA or Biologics License Application, or BLA, or their foreign equivalents) can be filed with the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval of our product candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in early phases of pre-clinical and clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates. Our product candidates may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude us from obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use with respect to one or all intended indications.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, EMA, and other regulatory authorities in the United States, European Union, and other countries, where regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates as prescription pharmaceutical products in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA or a BLA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA or a BLA is approved. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA or a BLA to the FDA or other regulatory authorities and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.\nWe have not submitted an NDA or a BLA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities. We have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on consultants and third party CROs with expertise in this area to assist us in this process. If our development efforts for our product candidates, including regulatory approval, are not successful for their planned indications, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on the receipt of regulatory approval and the issuance of such regulatory approvals is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf the results of nonclinical or toxicology studies may not support the filing of an IND or foreign equivalent for our CVB vaccine product candidate;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or IRBs or ECs may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of our product candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials may not be satisfactory or may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA, EMA, or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval;\n\u25cf the dosing of our product candidates in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u25cf patients in our clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, BLA or other marketing application or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the potential for the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities to require additional studies, including a second phase 3 study for the PRV-031 program in T1D, which may require us to raise additional capital and may delay the approval of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree on the design or implementation of our clinical trials, including the methodology used in our studies, our chosen endpoints, our statistical analysis, or our proposed product indication;\n\u25cf our failure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA, or comparable regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf we may fail to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf immunogenicity might affect a product candidate efficacy and/or safety;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient to support the submission and filing of a marketing application or to obtain marketing approval. For example, the FDA may require additional studies to show that our product candidates are safe or effective;\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf we may fail to obtain approval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf the third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates in a timely manner;\n\u25cf there may be changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our nonclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval; or\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional nonclinical or clinical data to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program.\nFailure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates for the foregoing, or any other reasons, will prevent or delay us from commercializing our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. We cannot guarantee that regulators will agree with our assessment of the results of the clinical trials we have conducted or intend to conduct in the future or that such future trials will be successful. The FDA, EMA and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional clinical trials, or pre-clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates for an indication, the FDA, EMA, or foreign equivalent may still impose significant restrictions on their indicated uses or marketing or the conditions of approval or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, post-market surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy and a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. For example, we intend to initially seek regulatory approval for our CVB vaccine product candidate for the prevention of acute CVB infection. The results of longitudinal studies demonstrating the connection between CVB and T1D and T1D-associated celiac disease will be necessary to expand the indicated use of this vaccine to T1D. These studies must be completed and submitted to the FDA or EMA prior to receiving approval in the United States or European Union to market the CVB vaccine to prevent T1D. Such studies will be costly and time consuming and may not demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the connection between the CVB virus and the onset of T1D.\nOur product candidates will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, as well as continued compliance with current Good Clinical Practices regulations, or cGCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents.\nWith respect to sales and marketing activities by us or any future licensor, advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other applicable federal, state and local laws in the United States and similar legal requirements in other countries. In the United States, the distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Application holders must obtain FDA approval for product and manufacturing changes, depending on the nature of the change. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and licensors, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs. If we participate in the U.S. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Similar requirements exist in many of these areas in other countries.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates are approved for a particular indication, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, physicians may nevertheless legally prescribe our products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to the following administrative or judicial sanctions:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf issuance of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cf clinical holds;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u25cf suspension or imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u25cf product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of product.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase our product liability exposure.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/ or to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our product candidates and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 or, collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.\nThe Health Care Reform Law remains subject to legislative efforts to repeal, modify or delay the implementation of the law. However, if the Health Care Reform Law is repealed or modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law are delayed, such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law on us at this time. Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by CMS and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms, we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce or eliminate our profitability.\nIf we fail to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we may need to acquire additional product candidates and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe have never developed and obtained approval for any product candidates or commercialized any product candidates. We have limited product candidates and do not have any other compounds in pre-clinical testing, lead optimization or lead identification stages beyond our product candidates. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be sufficiently effective and safe to meet applicable regulatory standards for any indication. If we fail to successfully obtain regulatory approval or commercialize any of our product candidates for their targeted indications, whether as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other therapeutic agents, and if we are unable to acquire additional product candidates in the future, our business will be adversely affected.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited.\nIf approved for marketing, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon each product\u2019s acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance for any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf relative convenience, dosing burden and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any adverse events;\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians to prescribe our product candidates, and the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u25cf efficacy of our product candidates compared to competing products;\n\u25cf the introduction of any new products that may in the future become available targeting indications for which our product candidates may be approved;\n\u25cf new procedures or therapies that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications in which our product candidates may show utility;\n\u25cf pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf the inclusion or omission of our product candidates in applicable therapeutic and vaccine guidelines;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our own or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in approved labeling from regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors or to receive the necessary pricing approvals from government bodies regulating the pricing and usage of therapeutics; and\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement or government pricing approvals.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render our product candidates not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve any of our product candidates with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization for that indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals or require risk management plans or a REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our product candidates. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our product candidates.\nWe currently have a limited commercial organization. If we are unable to establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities or secure a sales and marketing partner, we may not successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe have just recently begun to build out our commercial infrastructure and at present, we have only limited sales or marketing personnel. In order to commercialize products that are approved for commercial sales, we must either develop our own sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have such commercial infrastructure. If we are not successful entering into appropriate collaboration arrangements or recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nAmgen has the right to assume control over the activities of our anti-IL-15 mAb product candidate.\nPursuant to our License and Collaboration Agreement with Amgen, or the Amgen Agreement, Amgen reserves the right, at any time until 120 days after the delivery of the final data package relating to the Phase 2b PROACTIVE study that we expect to commence in the second quarter of 2020, to assume control over all activities with respect to our anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody, or mAb, product candidate, including pricing and marketing decisions, after the payment of a $150.0 million milestone. There can be no assurance that Amgen\u2019s strategic direction will be in line with ours should it assume control of activities, or that their decisions will have a positive impact on our results of operations. Moreover, we may not realize the full economic benefit of this agreement.\nWe face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have existing competitors and will have potential new competitors in a number of jurisdictions, many of which have or will have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make any of our product candidates obsolete or uneconomical. Any new product that competes with an approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, cost, convenience, tolerability and safety to be commercially successful. Other competitive factors, including generic competition, could force us to lower prices or could result in reduced sales. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to our product candidates. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nOur potential competitors both in the United States and throughout the world include companies developing and/or marketing drugs and therapeutic solutions for immune-mediated diseases, including oncological, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as companies working in our specific fields, including T1D, enteroviral and emerging viral diseases, lupus, and inflammatory bowel diseases, such as CD.\nThere can be no assurance that our product candidates will be more effective or achieve greater market acceptance than competitive products, or that our competitors will not succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our products and technologies less competitive or obsolete. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the development by others of new or improved products will not make our product candidates superfluous or obsolete.\nOur product candidates may face competition sooner than expected.\nWe intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our monoclonal antibodies PRV-031 and PRV-015, our DART molecule PRV-3279 and our PRV-101 CVB vaccine product candidates provided under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and similar laws in other countries. We believe that these product candidates will qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the Health Care Reform Law. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product or BLA cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The law is complex and the processes the FDA establishes to implement the law could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological product candidates. There is also a risk that Congress could repeal or amend the BPCIA to shorten this exclusivity period, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated after the expiration of our patent protection. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nOur product candidates that are not, or are not considered, biologics that would qualify for exclusivity under the BPCIA may be eligible for market exclusivity as drugs under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.\nEven if, as we expect, our product candidates are considered to be reference products eligible for 12 years of exclusivity under the BPCIA or five years of exclusivity under the FDCA, another company could market competing products if the FDA approves a full BLA or full NDA for such product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the products. Moreover, an amendment or repeal of the BPCIA could result in a shorter exclusivity period for our product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to penetrate international markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize our product candidates in international markets for which we intend to rely on collaborations with third parties. If we commercialize any of our product candidates in international markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our product candidates in international markets;\n\u25cf our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;\n\u25cf the burden of complying with complex and changing international regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u25cf different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u25cf import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf longer accounts receivable collection times;\n\u25cf longer lead times for shipping;\n\u25cf language barriers for technical training;\n\u25cf reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u25cf the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nInternational sales of our product candidates could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we market any of our product candidates in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, or if we violate government price reporting laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA enforces laws and regulations which require that the promotion of pharmaceutical products be consistent with the approved prescribing information. While physicians may prescribe an approved product for a so-called \u201coff label\u201d use, it is unlawful for a pharmaceutical company to promote its products in a manner that is inconsistent with its approved label and any company which engages in such conduct can subject that company to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines and/or other penalties against companies for alleged improper promotion and has investigated and/or prosecuted several companies in relation to off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that certain companies enter consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed, curtailed or prohibited. Similarly, industry codes in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions prohibit companies from engaging in off-label promotion and regulatory agencies in various countries enforce violations of the code with civil penalties. While we intend to ensure that our promotional materials are consistent with our label, regulatory agencies may disagree with our assessment and may issue untitled letters, warning letters or may institute other civil or criminal enforcement proceedings. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nThe U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not, in all cases, meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the U.S. False Claims Act. Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and healthcare laws and regulations.\nOver the past few years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicare or Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and the U.S. False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include substantial civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, substantial criminal fines and imprisonment.\nWe are completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and our commercialization of our product candidates could be halted, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain manufacturing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our product candidates or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the capability or infrastructure to manufacture the bulk drug substance or the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in our product candidates for use in our clinical trials or for commercial products, if any. As a result, we are obligated to rely on contract manufacturers for clinical supplies of our product candidates and will be obligated, if and when any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, to rely on contract manufacturers for commercial supply. We have not entered into an agreement with any contract manufacturers for commercial supply and may not be able to engage a contract manufacturer for commercial supply of any of our product candidates on acceptable terms to us, or at all.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA or BLA to the FDA or equivalent applications to other relevant regulatory authorities. We will not control the manufacturing process of, and will be completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. These cGMP regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to our product candidates. If our contract manufacturers do not successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nOur contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. We do not have control over our contract manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by any of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure to grant approval to market any of our product candidates, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. In addition, we do not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Failure by our contract manufacturers to comply with or maintain any of these standards could adversely affect our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market any of our product candidates.\nIf, for any reason, these third parties are unable or unwilling to perform, we may not be able to terminate our agreements with them, to the extent applicable, and we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them and we cannot be certain that any such third parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these manufacturers or any alternate manufacturer of finished drug product experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes for our API or finished products or should cease doing business with us, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our product candidates or may not be able to create a supply of our product candidates at all. Were we to encounter manufacturing issues, our ability to produce a sufficient supply of any of our product candidates might be negatively affected. Our inability to coordinate the efforts of our third-party manufacturers, or the lack of capacity available at our third-party manufacturers, could impair our ability to supply any of our product candidates at required levels. Because of the significant regulatory requirements that we would need to satisfy in order to qualify a new bulk or finished product manufacturer, if we face these or other difficulties with our current manufacturers, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our product candidates if we decided to transfer the manufacture of any of our product candidates to one or more alternative manufacturers in an effort to deal with the difficulties.\nAny manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally, we rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our potential products. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to a future contract manufacturer caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of any of our product candidates, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales.\nWe cannot guarantee that our future manufacturers and suppliers will be able to reduce the costs of commercial scale manufacturing of any of our product candidates over time. If the commercial-scale manufacturing costs of any of our product candidates are higher than expected, these costs may significantly impact our operating results. In order to reduce costs, we may need to develop and implement process improvements. However, in order to do so, we will need, from time to time, to notify or make submissions with regulatory authorities, and the improvements may be subject to approval by such regulatory authorities. We cannot be sure that we will receive these necessary approvals or that these approvals will be granted in a timely fashion. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to enhance and optimize output in our commercial manufacturing process. If we cannot enhance and optimize output, we may not be able to reduce our costs over time.\nWe have no experience manufacturing PRV-031. As a result, if we encounter manufacturing issues, delays or increased costs in the PROTECT study may occur.\nWe have no experience manufacturing PRV-031. We currently rely on a single third-party manufacturer to supply us with PRV-031 drug substance on a purchase order basis. In order to obtain regulatory approval for PRV-031, this third-party manufacturer will be required to consistently produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient used in PRV-031 in commercial quantities and of specified quality on a repeated basis and document its ability to do so. This is referred to as process validation. In addition, in November 2019 the FDA confirmed that it would require the demonstration of comparability between the study drug previously manufactured by MacroGenics and Eli Lilly and the to-be-commercialized drug substance and drug product scheduled for production by Provention and its contract manufacturing partners. If this third-party manufacturer is unable to satisfy this requirement, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur current PRV-031 drug supply will not fully supply the PROTECT study to completion and we will need to produce new drug supply to complete the PROTECT study and to demonstrate that the new drug supply is comparable to the old supply. Further, the PROTECT study will need to include data from a sufficient number of subjects dosed with this new drug supply in this clinical trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy in order to obtain regulatory approval. If our third-party manufacturer is unable to produce a sufficient and comparable new drug supply to complete the PROTECT study in a timely manner, we may be required to suspend the PROTECT study until sufficient amounts of the new drug supply are produced. This may result in increased clinical trial costs and delays in obtaining regulatory approval for PRV-031. Such delays would in turn delay the marketing and commercialization of PRV-031, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur third-party manufacturer has not made any lots of PRV-031 to date. The manufacturing processes for PRV-031 have never been tested at commercial scale, and the process validation requirement has not yet been satisfied. These manufacturing processes and our third-party manufacturer\u2019s facility will be subject to inspection and approval by the FDA before we can commence the manufacture and sale of PRV-031. If our third-party manufacturer is unable to pass such inspection and otherwise satisfactorily complete the FDA approval regimen, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nAlso, as we or any manufacturer we engage scales up manufacturing of any approved product, we may encounter unexpected issues relating to the manufacturing process or the quality, purity and stability of the product, and we may be required to refine or alter our manufacturing processes to address these issues. Resolving these issues could result in significant delays and may result in significantly increased costs. If we experience significant delays or other obstacles in producing any approved product for commercial scale, our ability to market and sell any approved products may be adversely affected and our business could suffer.\nChanges in product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. During the course of a development program, sponsors may also change the contract manufacturers used to produce the product candidates. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of clinical trials. Such changes may also require additional testing, notification or approval by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities. This could delay completion of clinical trials; require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or studies, or the repetition of one or more clinical trials; increase clinical trial costs; delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates and our business would be substantially harmed.\nWe rely on third-party CROs and vendors to conduct and manage our clinical programs including contracting with clinical sites to perform our clinical trials. We plan to rely heavily on these parties for execution of clinical trials for our product candidates and will control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs and clinical sites will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any products in clinical development. The FDA and its foreign equivalents enforce these cGCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA or other regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCPs. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test subjects. Our failure or the failure of our CROs or clinical sites to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action up to and including civil and criminal penalties.\nAlthough we design the clinical trials for our product candidates in consultation with CROs, we expect that the CROs will manage all of the clinical trials conducted at contracted clinical sites. As a result, many important aspects of our drug development programs would be outside of our direct control. In addition, the CROs and clinical sites may not perform all of their obligations under arrangements with us or in compliance with regulatory requirements. If the CROs or clinical sites do not perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, breach their obligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates for the subject indication may be delayed or our development program materially and irreversibly harmed. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources these CROs and clinical sites will devote to our program or any of our product candidates. If we are unable to rely on clinical data collected by our CROs, we could be required to repeat, extend the duration of, or increase the size of our clinical trials, which could significantly delay commercialization and require significantly greater expenditures.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or clinical sites terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or clinical sites. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, any such clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any of our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, any necessary studies of any of our product candidates for any indications could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u25cf the FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority failing to grant permission to proceed and placing the clinical trial on hold;\n\u25cf subjects failing to enroll or remain in our trials at the rate we expect;\n\u25cf a facility manufacturing any of our product candidates being ordered by the FDA, EMA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP requirements or other applicable requirements, or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process;\n\u25cf any changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u25cf subjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indications for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing clinical studies;\n\u25cf subjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u25cf reports from clinical testing on similar technologies and products raising safety and/or efficacy concerns;\n\u25cf third-party clinical investigators losing their license or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or employing methods consistent with the clinical trial protocol, cGMP requirements, or other third parties not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u25cf inspections of clinical study sites by the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or IRBs finding regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action, result in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire study, or that prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u25cf third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or any of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications;\n\u25cf one or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the study at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing its approval of the trial; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf deviations of the clinical sites from trial protocols or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf the inability of our CRO to execute any clinical trials for any reason; and\n\u25cf government or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of a trial.\nProduct development costs for any of our product candidates will increase if we have delays in testing or approval or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend study protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our study protocols to the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of that study. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical trial sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical trials of any of our product candidates, its commercial prospects may be materially harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, if one or more clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of any of our product candidates could be significantly reduced.\nEven though we may obtain or apply for orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be able to obtain orphan drug marketing exclusivity.\nThe treatment of recent-onset T1D is an orphan indication, and PRV-031 has been designated as an orphan drug for this indication by the FDA. Some of the subsets of lupus erythematosus are orphan indications (e.g., lupus nephritis).\nHowever, there is no guarantee that the FDA, EMA or its foreign equivalents will grant any future application for orphan drug designation for any of our other product candidates, including PRV-031 in the At-Risk indication, which would make us ineligible for the additional exclusivity and other benefits of orphan drug designation.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the Unites States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.\nIf a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug\u2019s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant\u2019s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates in the indications for which we think they might qualify, if we elect to seek such applications.\nAs a result, even though we have received orphan drug exclusivity for PRV-031 for the treatment of recent-onset T1D in the United States, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication. Furthermore, the FDA can waive orphan drug exclusivity if we are unable to manufacture sufficient supply of PRV-031 or if the FDA finds that a subsequent applicant for recent-onset T1D demonstrates clinical superiority to PRV-031.\nAlthough we may pursue expedited regulatory approval pathways for a product candidate, it may not qualify for expedited development or, if it does qualify for expedited development, it may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nAlthough we believe there may be an opportunity to accelerate the development of certain of our product candidates through one or more of the FDA\u2019s expedited programs, such as fast track, breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval or priority review, we cannot be assured that any of our product candidates will qualify for such programs.\nFor example, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Although breakthrough designation or access to any other expedited program may expedite the development or approval process, it does not change the standards for approval. If we apply for breakthrough therapy designation or any other expedited program for our product candidates, the FDA may determine that our proposed target indication or other aspects of our clinical development plans do not qualify for such expedited program. Even if we are successful in obtaining a breakthrough therapy designation or access to any other expedited program, we may not experience faster development timelines or achieve faster review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. For example, the time required to identify and resolve issues relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls, the acquisition of a sufficient supply of our product for clinical trial purposes or the need to conduct additional preclinical or clinical studies may delay approval by the FDA, even if the product candidate qualifies for a breakthrough therapy designation or access to any other expedited program. Access to an expedited program may also be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Additionally, qualification for any expedited review procedure does not ensure that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approval for such product candidate.\nThird-party coverage and reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues.\nOur ability to successfully market our product candidates will depend in part on the level of reimbursement that government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations provide for the cost of our products and related treatments. Countries in which any of our product candidates are sold through reimbursement schemes under national health insurance programs frequently require that manufacturers and sellers of pharmaceutical products obtain governmental approval of initial prices and any subsequent price increases. In certain countries, including the United States, government-funded and private medical care plans can exert significant indirect pressure on prices. We may not be able to sell our product candidates profitably if adequate prices are not approved or coverage and reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope. Increasingly, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs in ways that are likely to impact our development of products including:\n\u25cf failing to approve or challenging the prices charged for health care products;\n\u25cf introducing reimportation schemes from lower priced jurisdictions;\n\u25cf limiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic products;\n\u25cf denying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the regulatory agencies but are considered to be experimental or investigational by third-party payors; and\n\u25cf refusing to provide coverage when an approved product is used in a way that has not received regulatory marketing approval.\nMoreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products. There have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe depend on rights to certain pharmaceutical compounds that are licensed to us. We do not control these pharmaceutical compounds and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from selling our products.\nWe are dependent on licenses from third parties for all but one of our pharmaceutical compounds. We do not own the patents that underlie these licenses. Our rights to use the pharmaceutical compounds we license are subject to the continuation of and compliance with the terms of those licenses. Thus, the patents and patent applications applicable to our product candidates were not written by us or our attorneys, and we did not have control over the drafting and prosecution. The former patent owners and our licensors might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of these patents and applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the patents and applications and had control over the drafting. Moreover, under certain of our licenses, patent prosecution activities remain under the control of the licensor. We cannot be certain that drafting of the licensed patents and patent applications, or patent prosecution, by the licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOur rights to develop and commercialize the product candidates we license are subject to the validity of the owner\u2019s intellectual property rights. Enforcement of our licensed patents or defense or any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents is often subject to the control or cooperation of our licensors. Legal action could be initiated against the owners of the intellectual property that we license and an adverse outcome in such legal action could harm our business because it might prevent such companies or institutions from continuing to license intellectual property that we may need to operate our business. In addition, such licensors may resolve such litigation in a way that benefits them but adversely affects our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nIn addition, our rights to practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not terminating them. Our licenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in material breach of certain terms or conditions of the license agreement or in certain other circumstances. Certain of our licenses contained in our agreements with Janssen and Vactech contain provisions that allow the licensor to terminate the license if (i) we breach any payment obligation or other material provision under the agreement and fail to cure the breach within a fixed time following written notice of termination, (ii) we or any of our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees directly or indirectly challenge the validity, enforceability, or extension of any of the licensed patents, (iii) we declare bankruptcy or dissolve, (iv) we fail to maintain a licensed product in active development or fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize a licensed product. Our rights under the licenses are subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the license, including the payment of royalties due under the license. Termination of these licenses could prevent us from marketing some or all of our products. Because of the complexity of our products and the patents we have licensed, determining the scope of the license and related royalty obligations can be difficult and can lead to disputes between us and the licensor. An unfavorable resolution of such a dispute could lead to an increase in the royalties payable pursuant to the license. If a licensor believed we were not paying the royalties due under the license or were otherwise not in compliance with the terms of the license, the licensor might attempt to revoke the license. If such an attempt were successful, we might be barred from producing and selling some or all of our products.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our technologies, products and processes, successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing these patents against third party competitors. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowable or enforceable in our patents. We currently own 8 issued patents, license 389 issued patents, and license 149 pending patents for our product candidates, in which the pending applications may never be approved by United States or foreign patent offices. The existing patents and patent applications relating to our product candidates and related technologies may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights, permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, or provide us with any competitive advantage at all. For example, others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar, identical or competitive to any of our product candidates, or important to our business. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications filed by us, or that we will not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before United States or foreign patent offices.\nIn the future we may rely on know-how and trade secrets to protect technology, especially in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, know-how and trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we intend to require employees, academic collaborators, consultants and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary or licensed information. Typically, research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information in which we may have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, our ability to receive patent protection and our ability to protect valuable information owned by us may be imperiled. Enforcing a claim that a third-party entity illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than patents. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for our product candidates or our technologies, third parties could use our proprietary information, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and attain profitability.\nWe may also rely on the trademarks we may develop to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors. We cannot guarantee that any trademark applications filed by us or our licensors will be approved. Third parties may also oppose such trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that the trademarks we use are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe the trademarks we use, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce these trademarks.\nOur product candidates may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the proprietary technologies of others. The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our proprietary technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Additionally, because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of any of our product candidates or any future product candidate. There may be certain issued patents and patent applications claiming subject matter that we may be required to license in order to research, develop or commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know if such patents and patent applications would be available to license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-consuming and may:\n\u25cf result in costly litigation;\n\u25cf divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u25cf prevent us from commercializing a product until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u25cf require us to cease or modify our use of the technology and/or develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u25cf require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nThird parties may hold proprietary rights that could prevent any of our product candidates from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to any of our product candidates or our processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market any of our product candidates or any future product candidates. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign our product candidates or any future product candidates or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing any of our product candidates or a future product candidate, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA number of companies, including several major pharmaceutical companies, have conducted, or are conducting, research in immune-mediated diseases within the therapeutic fields in which we intend to operate, which has resulted, or may result, in the filing of many patent applications related to this research. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every issued United States patent. This means that, in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in an administrative trial before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we would have to prove that the claims are unpatentable by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no assurance that a jury and/or court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity or enforceability.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we will employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nGeneral Company-Related Risks\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs our development and commercialization plans and strategies continue to develop, we intend to expand the size of our employee and consultant/contractor base. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and any other future product candidates and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our future growth.\nFuture capital raises may dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership and/or have other adverse effects on our operations.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership will be reduced, and these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or candidate products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. In addition, the loss of the services of our co-founders would adversely impact our business prospects.\nOur management team has expertise in many different aspects of drug development and commercialization. However, our ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We will need to hire additional personnel as we further develop our product candidates. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and competition for experienced scientists may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. However, these employment arrangements will provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. Moreover, there can be no assurance that anyone we expect to employ in a key management position will be available to join our team when we expect them to, if at all. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees, or our inability to hire targeted executives, could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. In particular, we believe that the loss of the services of our co-founders would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nOther pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates would be limited.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face a potential risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any of our product candidates or any other future product. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop, including any of our product candidates, or any materials that we use in our products allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. In the US, claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any of our product candidates or any future products that we may develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize some or all of our product candidates; and\n\u25cf a decline in the value of our stock.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We maintain product liability insurance covering our clinical trials. Although we will maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe may acquire businesses or products, or form strategic alliances, in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction.\nWe are a virtual company and may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyber-attacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nWe are a virtual company and may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyber-attacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nCyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, and other means to threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. A successful cyber-attack could cause serious negative consequences for our company, including the disruption of operations, the misappropriation of confidential business information and trade secrets, and the disclosure of corporate strategic plans. To date, we have not experienced threats to our data and information technology systems. However, although we devote resources to protect our information technology systems, we realize that cyber-attacks are a threat, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal or reputational harm to us, or would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of our information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach or disruption of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The form and function of such systems may change over time as our business needs change. The nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal and financial information regarding our customers. We use our information technology systems to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing and accounts payable. In addition, we use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize transactions and other financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions, disruptions or shutdowns, could result in the unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets or the loss of key data and information, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. If our information technology systems are breached or suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of our patient, employee, supplier or Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation, enforcement actions and reputational damage.\nOur business, like that of most biopharmaceutical companies, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of patient information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company. Our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees or third-party service providers. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information and device security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. The ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and our efforts may not be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, misuse of data or sabotage of our systems. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of patient, employee, supplier or Company data, could result in additional significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits and damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nWe face business disruption and related risks resulting from the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which could have a material adverse effect on our business plan.\nThe development of our product candidates could be disrupted and materially adversely affected by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. As a result of measures imposed by the governments in affected regions, businesses and schools have been suspended due to quarantines intended to contain this outbreak. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the Director General of the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), based on the advice of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. issued a warning on February 25, 2020 regarding the likely spread of COVID-19 to the U.S. While the COVID-19 outbreak is still in very early stages, international stock markets have begun to reflect the uncertainty associated with the slow-down in the Chinese economy and the reduced levels of international travel experienced since the beginning of January and the significant declines in the Dow Industrial Average at the end of February and beginning of March 2020 was largely attributed to the effects of COVID-19. We are still assessing our business plans and the impact COVID-19 may have on our ability to recruit candidates for clinical trials or to raise financing to support the development of our product candidates, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-019 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and can be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, the reporting of results of our clinical trials or partner-sponsored clinical trials involving our programs. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others such as:\n\u25cf our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing prospects;\n\u25cf our intentions and our ability to establish collaborations and/or partnerships;\n\u25cf the timing or likelihood of regulatory filings and approvals;\n\u25cf our development, commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities;\n\u25cf our expectations regarding the potential market size and the size of the patient populations for our product candidates;\n\u25cf the implementation of our business model and strategic plans for our business and technology;\n\u25cf the scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering our product candidates, along with any product modifications and improvements;\n\u25cf estimates of our expenses, future revenue, capital requirements, our needs for additional financing and our ability to obtain additional capital;\n\u25cf our financial performance; and\n\u25cf developments and projections relating to our competitors and our industry, including competing therapies and procedures.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not develop, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nPrior to our IPO, there was no public market for shares of our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity and an active public market for our shares may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair the ability to sell shares at the time a shareholder wish to sell them or at a price that a shareholder may consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications, or technologies using our shares as consideration.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We only recently obtained research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If there are insufficient securities or industry analysts covering us, the market price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reporting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current market price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 28% of our voting stock as of December 31, 2019. Therefore, these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 8,955,000 shares of common stock were subject to outstanding options, reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans or subject to outstanding warrants. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are incurring significant increased costs as a result of becoming a public company that reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and our management is required to devote substantial time to meet compliance obligations.\nAs a newly public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq that impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. In addition, on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that are expected to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. In addition, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contains provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u25cf the required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u25cf the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, these provisions would apply even if we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our bylaws became effective immediately prior to the completion of the IPO and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u25cf we will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful;\n\u25cf we may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;\n\u25cf we are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;\n\u25cf we will not be obligated pursuant to our bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification;\n\u25cf the rights conferred in our bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and\n\u25cf we may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction.\nThe choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, the ability to achieve a return on investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, shareholders are not likely to receive any dividends on their common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, the ability to receive a return on investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decrease.\nBeginning with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2019, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting which will need to be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm once our status as an emerging growth company ceases.\nIf we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or, once required, provide an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We could also become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation as well as investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, trading suspensions or other remedies.", "PERMNO": 17973, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PRVB"}
