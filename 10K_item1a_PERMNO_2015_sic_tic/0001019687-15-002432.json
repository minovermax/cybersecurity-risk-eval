{"cik": "1367083", "company": "Oculus Innovative Sciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses, we expect to continue to incur losses and we may never achieve profitability and our March 31, 2015 audited consolidated financial statements included disclosure that casts substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe reported a net loss of $8,203,000 and a loss from operations of $6,659,000 for the year ended March 31, 2015. We reported net income of $3,735,000 and a loss from operations of $6,051,000 for the year ended March 31, 2014. At March 31, 2015 and 2014, our accumulated deficit amounted to $142,213,000 and $134,010,000, respectively. We had working capital of $7,066,000 and $1,970,000 as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the year ended March 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $6,694,000. We expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability. We must raise additional capital to pursue our product development initiatives, penetrate markets for the sale of our products and continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurance that we will raise additional capital. We believe that we have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means. We may not raise enough capital in this offering to meet our needs and we may have to raise additional capital in the future. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in our efforts to further commercialize our products, which are critical to the realization of our business plan and to our future operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern or become profitable.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements as set forth in The NASDAQ Listing Rules, our common stock and trading warrants could be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, and if this were to occur, then the price and liquidity of our common stock and trading warrants, and our ability to raise additional capital, may be adversely affected.\nOur common stock and trading warrants are currently listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Continued listing of a security on The NASDAQ Capital Market is conditioned upon compliance with certain continued listing requirements and continued listing standards set forth in the NASDAQ Listing Rules for NASDAQ Capital Market companies. There can be no assurance we will continue to satisfy the requirements for maintaining a NASDAQ Capital Market listing.\nIf we are not able to maintain compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in the NASDAQ Listing Rules for NASDAQ Capital Market companies, our common stock and warrants will likely be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market and an associated decrease in liquidity in the market for our common stock and warrants may occur. On March 6, 2015, we received a letter from the listing qualifications staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, we failed to comply with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires us to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for our common stock. In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), NASDAQ granted us a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until September 2, 2015, to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. If at any time during this 180 day period the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will regain compliance with the Listing Rule and NASDAQ will close the matter. The letter has no effect on the listing or trading of our common stock at this time. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). We intend to cure the bid price compliance deficiency by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. The delisting of our common stock and warrants could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets, and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our common stock and warrants could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market could also result in the potential loss of confidence by our business partners and suppliers, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nWe have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from our partnership with Innovacyn and based on Innovacyn\u2019s transition to a new partner, we may lose some or all of that revenue, unless we adequately replace Innovacyn with new partners.\nFor the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 8% and 23%, respectively, of our total revenues were derived from our sales agreement with Innovacyn, Inc., our animal health care partner. During the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded revenue related to these agreements in the amounts of $1,120,000 and $3,100,000, respectively. In April of 2014, Innovacyn notified us that it intended to transition to a new supplier of animal care products. Most of their animal care product was transitioned to the new supplier. As part of our search for new animal healthcare partners, on February 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement with SLA Brands, Inc. pursuant to which SLA will be our exclusive sales representative and distributor of pet specialty and equine products within the United States and Canada for pet and equine specialty retailers, catalogs and distributors. The agreement is effective through February 1, 2016, and will continue year to year until terminated by either party with 60 calendar days\u2019 notice. We can give no assurances that this partnership will be able replace our revenues to the same levels as we had with Innovacyn.\nThe value of the shares we hold in Ruthigen may fluctuate dramatically, which may affect the value of our assets and could negatively affect our stock price.\nOur former wholly-owned subsidiary, Ruthigen, consummated its IPO on March 26, 2014. At the time of the IPO, we held 2,000,000 shares of Ruthigen. Following our sale of 350,000 shares of Ruthigen common stock on March 31, 2015, we held 1,650,000 shares of Ruthigen common stock. On January 8, 2015, we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell our remaining 2,000,000 shares in Ruthigen to two accredited investors for an aggregate purchase price of $5,500,000 upon the occurrence of a triggering event during a standstill period of 60 calendar days. The securities purchase agreement lapsed according to its terms. On March 13, 2015, we entered into a securities purchase follow-up agreement under which we reduced the number of Ruthigen shares to be sold to the investors mentioned above to 1,650,000 at a price of $2.75 per share, provided that 50,000 shares may be sold to another investor prior to closing, and extended the expiration date of the standstill period to March 13, 2015. The aggregate purchase price of the sale will be $4,537,500. This sale has been triggered by Ruthigen\u2019s announcement of its merger with Pulmatrix, Inc. on March 13, 2015. The sale is expected to close at the time of the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger and prior to August 13, 2015, except that such date may be extended for up to 60 calendar days at our sole discretion. If the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger does not close by August 13, 2015 or the extended date, there will be no obligation to purchase the shares. If we consummate the sale of the Ruthigen shares, we would no longer own any shareholder interest in Ruthigen. However, if the sale of the Ruthigen shares is not completed, we will continue to own the Ruthigen shares, subject to significant existing voting and resale restrictions.\nIn connection with entering into the securities purchase agreement at a fixed price of $2.75 per share, we determined that the carrying value of the two million shares held in Ruthigen was impaired. As a result, we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of $4,650,000 which represents the difference between cost and aggregate purchase price during the year ended March 31, 2015. Our interest in Ruthigen is currently reported as a long-term asset on our financial statements rather than a consolidated subsidiary. Because we own shares in a public company, the value of this asset may further fluctuate and the value stated in our financial reports may change substantially over time. Given that we no longer control Ruthigen following its IPO, we have very little means to control the value of the asset. If the value of our holdings in Ruthigen decreases or fluctuates further, it may adversely affect the value of our stock price.\nThe shares we own in Ruthigen are not liquid and we may never be able to realize cash for the value stated in our financials.\nAccording to the terms of our Separation Agreement with Ruthigen entered into in the overall context of Ruthigen\u2019s separation from us, or the Separation, we are unable to transfer any of the Ruthigen shares we own for one year following the IPO of Ruthigen without the written consent of both the Ruthigen\u2019s board of directors and the underwriter who assisted in the IPO. After the one-year lock up expires, we have agreed to additional transfer restrictions that may make it difficult to sell the shares we own in Ruthigen in a timely manner, if at all. Therefore, we may be unable to realize the value of this asset even after the lock up period expires. In addition, our agreement with Pulmatrix dated March 13, 2015 provides that, as of the effective date of the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger, certain provisions in the Separation Agreement regarding marketing and stock transfer restrictions, lock-up, registration rights, voting, management, compensation and equity incentive plan, will be terminated.\nOn January 8, 2015, we agreed to sell our shares in Ruthigen to two investors for an aggregate purchase price of $5,500,000 upon the occurrence of a triggering event during a standstill period of 60 calendar days. The securities purchase agreement lapsed according to its terms. On March 13, 2015, we entered into a securities purchase follow-up agreement under which we reduced the number of Ruthigen shares to be sold to the investors mentioned above to 1,650,000 at a price of $2.75 per share, provided that 50,000 shares may be sold to another investor prior to closing, and extended the expiration date of the standstill period to March 13, 2015. The aggregate purchase price of the sale will be $4,537,500. This sale has been triggered by Ruthigen\u2019s announcement of its merger with Pulmatrix, Inc. on March 13, 2015. The sale is expected to close at the time of the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger and prior to August 13, 2015, except that such date may be extended for up to 60 calendar days at our sole discretion. If the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger does not close by August 13, 2015 or the extended date, there will be no obligation to purchase the shares. On March 13, 2015, we also sold 350,000 shares of Ruthigen common stock to other investors at $2.75 per share. In addition, on March 13, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Pulmatrix, Inc., a Delaware corporation that has announced its intention to merge with Ruthigen, under which we would no longer be bound by the lock-up, transfer and other marketing restrictions following the consummation of the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger. We received the written consent of Ruthigen\u2019s board of directors and the underwriter who assisted in the IPO for these transactions. If we consummate the sale of the Ruthigen shares, we would no longer own any shareholder interest in Ruthigen. However, if the sale of the Ruthigen shares is not completed, we will continue to own the Ruthigen shares, subject to the lock-up. Furthermore, we can give no assurance that a liquid trading market for Ruthigen shares will develop and be sustained in the future and we may be unable to sell the shares we own in Ruthigen for the amount at which they are valued, if at all. In addition, Ruthigen\u2019s stock price and liquidity may be adversely affected by our minority interest in Ruthigen.\nThere is no assurance when or if the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger will be completed. A delay or termination in completing the merger may affect our sale of the Ruthigen shares and their value.\nOn March 13, 2015, Ruthigen, Ruthigen Merger Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ruthigen, and Pulmatrix entered into an agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, which provides for, among other things, the merger of Pulmatrix with and into Ruthigen Merger Corp., with Pulmatrix continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Ruthigen, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The boards of directors of each of Ruthigen and Pulmatrix have unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the merger. On January 8, 2015, we agreed to sell our shares in Ruthigen to two investors for an aggregate purchase price of $5,500,000 upon the occurrence of a trigger event during a standstill period of 60 calendar days. The securities purchase agreement lapsed according to its terms. On March 13, 2015, we entered into a securities purchase follow-up agreement under which we reduced the number of Ruthigen shares to be sold to the investors mentioned above to 1,650,000 at a price of $2.75 per share, provided that 50,000 shares may be sold to another investor prior to closing, and extended the expiration date of the standstill period to March 13, 2015. The aggregate purchase price of the sale will be $4,537,500. This sale has been triggered by Ruthigen\u2019s announcement of its merger on March 13, 2015. The sale is expected to close at the time of the Ruthigen merger and prior to August 13, 2015, except that such date may be extended for up to 60 calendar days at our sole discretion. If the Ruthigen merger does not close by August 13, 2015 or the extended date, there will be no obligation to purchase the shares. Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement, such as the approval of the merger by the shareholders of both Ruthigen and Pulmatrix. There can be no assurance that Ruthigen and Pulmatrix will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond their control will be satisfied or waived. If the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger does not close by October 12, 2015, our sale of the Ruthigen shares will not close and we will continue to hold the Ruthigen shares. In addition, if Ruthigen does not proceed with the merger, it is uncertain what effects a termination of the merger would have on Ruthigen\u2019s business and results of operations, and therefore the value of the shares.\nWe may never receive any royalty or milestone payments as established in our License and Supply Agreement with Ruthigen.\nWe entered into a license and supply agreement with Ruthigen on May 23, 2013, which was subsequently amended on October 9, 2013, November 6, 2013, January 31, 2014 and March 13, 2015, or the License and Supply Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the License and Supply Agreement, we agreed to an exclusive license of certain of our proprietary technology to Ruthigen in order to enable Ruthigen\u2019s research and development and commercialization of the newly discovered RUT58-60, and any improvements to it, in the United States, Canada, European Union and Japan, referred to as the Territory, for certain invasive procedures in humans as defined in the License and Supply Agreement. On March 13, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Pulmatrix under which we agreed to waive Ruthigen\u2019s obligation to develop and commercialize the Ruthigen products pursuant to the License and Supply Agreement between us and Ruthigen, until the earlier of August 31, 2016 or one year after the effective date of the Pulmatrix-Ruthigen merger. Additionally, we agreed that Ruthigen may assign and/or delegate its rights and obligations under the License and Supply Agreement to a credible third party and sell substantially all of the pre-merger Ruthigen business, including any of our licensed products. We were granted a right of first refusal prior to a sale of the pre-merger business of Ruthigen with a minimum aggregate purchase price of $1.0 million. In the case of such a proposed sale, Ruthigen must first notify us of the pending transaction and we will have five business days after receipt of such notice to notify Ruthigen whether we intend to acquire the pre-merger business of Ruthigen on exactly the same terms, including the amount and kind of consideration, unless securities of the proposed acquirer will be offered as consideration, in which case we will instead pay cash equal to the fair market value of such securities. If we do not exercise our right of first refusal, Ruthigen may consummate the transaction pursuant to the agreed upon terms. Additionally, if such a transaction is consummated and the transaction generates aggregate proceeds in excess of $10.0 million, Ruthigen will be obligated to pay ten percent of the aggregate gross proceeds to us within ten calendar days.\nEven if Ruthigen continues to develop and commercialize RUT58-60, Ruthigen may never achieve the milestones established in the License and Supply Agreement or have the funds available to make the milestone payments and thus, we may never receive the milestone payments. If the entity surviving the Ruthigen merger does not develop RUT58-60, or an entity purchasing the rights to develop RUT58-60 does not develop RUT58-60 we may not receive milestone payments.\nOur inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including regulatory trials, sales and marketing, and international operations, in order to reduce costs and sustain the business, and such inability would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we work to conduct regulatory trials, commercialize our products and expand our infrastructure. We may need to raise additional capital in order to, among other things:\n\u00b7 fund our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u00b7 sustain commercialization of our current products or new products;\n\u00b7 expand our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u00b7 increase our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption and address competitive developments;\n\u00b7 acquire or license technologies;\n\u00b7 finance capital expenditures and our general and administrative expenses; and\n\u00b7 develop new products.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the progress and timing of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the level of research and development investment required to maintain and improve our technology position;\n\u00b7 cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 our efforts to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\n\u00b7 changes in product development plans needed to address any difficulties in commercialization;\n\u00b7 competing technological and market developments; and\n\u00b7 changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders will result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. A failure to obtain adequate funds may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including regulatory trials, sales and marketing, and international operations, in order to reduce costs and sustain our business, and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe do not have the necessary regulatory approvals to market Microcyn\u00ae as a drug in the United States.\nWe have obtained ten 510(k) clearances in the United States that permit us to sell Microcyn\u00ae-based products as medical devices. However, before we are permitted to sell Microcyn\u00ae as a drug in the United States, we must, among other things, successfully complete additional preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials, submit a new drug application to the FDA and obtain FDA approval.\nThe FDA approval process is expensive and uncertain, requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and other data and generally takes several years. Despite the time and expense exerted, approval is never guaranteed. Even if we obtain FDA approval to sell Microcyn\u00ae as a drug, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Microcyn\u00ae as a drug in the United States and may never recover the substantial costs we have invested in the development of our Microcyn\u00ae-based products.\nDelays or adverse results in clinical trials could result in increased costs to us and could delay our ability to generate revenue.\nClinical trials can be long and expensive, and the outcome of clinical trials is uncertain and subject to delays. It may take several years to complete clinical trials, if at all, and a product candidate may fail at any stage of the clinical trial process. The length of time required varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate. Interim results of a preclinical study or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in preclinical studies or early clinical trials may not be repeatable in later subsequent clinical trials. The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7 insufficient funds to continue our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 changes in the FDA requirements for approval, including requirements for testing efficacy and safety;\n\u00b7 delay in obtaining or failure to obtain FDA or other regulatory authority approval of a clinical trial protocol;\n\u00b7 patients not enrolling in clinical trials at the rate we expect;\n\u00b7 delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms with prospective sites;\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective site;\n\u00b7 third party clinical investigators not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or performance is not consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices, or the third party organizations not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; and\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nWe do not know whether future clinical trials will demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficiently to result in additional FDA approvals. While a number of physicians have conducted clinical studies assessing the safety and efficacy of Microcyn\u00ae for various indications, the data from these studies are not sufficient to support approval of Microcyn\u00ae as a drug in the United States.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of new drugs do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. The design of our clinical trials is based on many assumptions about the expected effects of our product candidates, and if those assumptions are incorrect, the trials may not produce statistically significant results. Preliminary results may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the detailed results of an early clinical trial. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show safety and efficacy sufficient to support intended use claims despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. The data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. Because of the uncertainties associated with drug development and regulatory approval, we cannot determine if or when we will have an approved product for commercialization or achieve sales or profits.\nIf we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, additional regulatory clearances or approvals to market our current or future products, we may be unable to commercialize these products.\nThe developing, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of medical technology products is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory clearance and approval of medical technology products is costly and time consuming. Even though their underlying product formulations may be the same or similar, our products are subject to different regulations and approval processes depending upon their intended use.\nTo obtain regulatory approval of our products as drugs in the United States, we must first show that our products are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical studies consisting of laboratory and animal testing and clinical trials consisting of human testing. The FDA generally clears marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) pre-market clearance process if it is demonstrated the new product has the same intended use and the same or similar technological characteristics as another legally marketed Class II device, such as a device already cleared by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process, and otherwise meets the FDA\u2019s requirements. Product modifications, including labeling the product for a new intended use, may require the submission of a new 510(k) clearance and FDA approval before the modified product can be marketed.\nThe outcomes of clinical trials are inherently uncertain. In addition, we do not know whether the necessary approvals or clearances will be granted or delayed for future products. The FDA could request additional information, changes to product formulation(s) or clinical testing that could adversely affect the time to market and sale of products as drugs. If we do not obtain the requisite regulatory clearances and approvals, we will be unable to commercialize our products as drugs or devices and may never recover any of the substantial costs we have invested in the development of Microcyn\u00ae.\nDistribution of our products outside the United States is subject to extensive government regulation. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market; the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations, vary from country to country. We do not know whether we will obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or that we will not be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining these regulatory approvals. In addition, the export by us of certain of our products that have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to FDA export restrictions. Failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, the restriction, suspension or revocation of existing approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our products do not gain market acceptance, our business will suffer because we might not be able to fund future operations.\nA number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our products or any other products we develop or acquire, including, among others:\n\u00b7 the price of our products relative to other products for the same or similar treatments;\n\u00b7 the perception by patients, physicians and other members of the healthcare community of the effectiveness and safety of our products for their indicated applications and treatments;\n\u00b7 changes in practice guidelines and the standard of care for the targeted indication;\n\u00b7 our ability to fund our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts or our partners\u2019 sales and marketing efforts.\nOur ability to effectively promote and sell any approved products will also depend on pricing and cost-effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement, if any. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources, may be constrained by FDA rules and policies on product promotion, and may never be successful. If our products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations, including developing, testing and obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates and expanding our sales and marketing efforts for our approved products, which would cause our business to suffer.\nIf our competitors develop products similar to Microcyn\u00ae, we may need to modify or alter our business strategy, which may delay the achievement of our goals.\nCompetitors have and may continue to develop products with similar characteristics to Microcyn\u00ae. Such similar products marketed by larger competitors can hinder our efforts to penetrate the market. As a result, we may be forced to modify or alter our business and regulatory strategy and sales and marketing plans, as a response to changes in the market, competition and technology limitations, among others. Such modifications may pose additional delays in achieving our goals.\nWe depend on third parties and intend to continue to license or collaborate with third parties in various potential markets, and events involving these strategic partners or any future collaboration could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing products.\nOur business strategy and our short- and long-term operating results depend in part on our ability to execute on existing strategic collaborations and to license or partner with new strategic partners. We believe collaborations allow us to leverage our resources and technologies and to access markets that are compatible with our own core areas of expertise while avoiding the cost of establishing or maintaining a direct sales force in each market. We may incur significant costs in the use of third parties to identify and assist in establishing relationships with potential collaborators. We currently have a small direct sales force, which sells our products in the tissue care, dermatology, and women\u2019s health markets, and we intend to slowly expand the geographical coverage of our direct sales force.\nTo penetrate our target markets, we may need to enter into additional collaborative agreements to assist in the development and commercialization of products. For example, depending upon our analysis of the time and expense involved in obtaining FDA approval to sell a product to treat open wounds, we may choose to license our technology to a third party as opposed to pursuing commercialization ourselves. Establishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position and our internal capabilities. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of new collaborations on favorable terms and may have the potential to provide collaborators with access to our key intellectual property filings and next generation formations. We have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our current collaborators or any future collaborators devote to our collaborations or potential products. These collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner. Further, our collaborators may not develop or commercialize products that arise out of our collaborative arrangements or devote sufficient resources to the development, manufacture, marketing or sale of these products. By entering into collaboration, we may preclude opportunities to collaborate with other third parties who do not wish to associate with our existing third party strategic partners. Moreover, in the event of termination of a collaboration agreement, termination negotiations may result in less favorable terms.\nIf we are unable to expand our direct domestic sales force, we may not be able to successfully sell our products in the United States.\nWe currently use a direct sales force to sell our products in the tissue care, dermatology, and women\u2019s health markets, while we have established partnerships to commercialize our products in the animal healthcare and dermatology markets. Expanding our sales force is expensive and time consuming, and the lack of qualified sales personnel could delay or limit the success of our product launch in the United States. Our domestic sales force competes with the sales operations of our competitors, which are better funded and more experienced. We may not be able to develop domestic sales capacity on a timely basis, or at all.\nOur dependence on a commission-based sales force and distributors for sales could limit or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets.\nWe currently depend on a commission-based sales force and distributors to sell Microcyn\u00ae in the United States, Europe and other countries, and intend to continue to sell our products primarily through a commission-based sales force and distributors in Europe and the United States for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to expand our direct sales force, we will continue to rely on a commission-based sales force and distributors to sell Microcyn\u00ae. Our existing commission-based sales force and distribution agreements are generally short-term in duration, and we may need to pursue alternate partners if the other parties to these agreements terminate or elect not to renew their agreements. If we are unable to retain our current commission-based sales force and distributors for any reason, we must replace them with alternate salespeople and distributors experienced in supplying the tissue care market, which could be time-consuming and divert management\u2019s attention from other operational matters. In addition, we will need to attract additional distributors to expand the geographic areas in which we sell Microcyn\u00ae. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations, which could harm our ability to generate revenues. In addition, some of our distributors may also sell products that compete with ours. In some countries, regulatory licenses must be held by residents of the country. For example, the regulatory approval for one of our products in India is owned and held by our Indian distributor. If the licenses are not in our name or under our control, we might not have the power to ensure their ongoing effectiveness and use by us. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas, we may not realize long-term revenue growth in certain markets.\nIf we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nRegulatory approvals or clearances that we currently have and that we may receive in the future are subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed, and any future approvals could contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use or we otherwise fail to comply with FDA regulations, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions, including warning letters, injunctions, seizures, civil fines or criminal penalties. In addition, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storing, advertising, promoting, distributing and record-keeping for approved products are subject to extensive regulation. We are subject to continued supervision by European regulatory agencies relating to our CE markings and are required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. Our manufacturing facilities, processes and specifications are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, Mexican and other regulatory authorities and from time to time, we may receive notices of deficiencies from these agencies as a result of such inspections. Our failure to continue to meet regulatory standards or to remedy any deficiencies could result in restrictions being imposed on our products or manufacturing processes, fines, suspension or loss of regulatory approvals or clearances, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or the need to invest substantial resources to comply with various existing and new requirements. In the more egregious cases, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with Microcyn\u00ae, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of our products, and could include voluntary or mandatory recall or withdrawal of products from the market.\nNew government regulations may be enacted and changes in FDA policies and regulations and, their interpretation and enforcement, could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. Therefore, we do not know whether we will be able to continue to comply with any regulations or that the costs of such compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we will not be permitted to market our products and our business would suffer.\nWe may experience difficulties in manufacturing Microcyn\u00ae, which could prevent us from commercializing one or more of our products.\nThe machines used to manufacture our Microcyn\u00ae-based products are complex, use complicated software and must be monitored by highly trained engineers. Slight deviations anywhere in our manufacturing process, including quality control, labeling and packaging, could lead to a failure to meet the specifications required by the FDA, the Environmental Protection Agency, European notified bodies, Mexican regulatory agencies and other foreign regulatory bodies, which may result in lot failures or product recalls. If we are unable to obtain quality internal and external components, mechanical and electrical parts, if our software contains defects or is corrupted, or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified technicians to manufacture our products, our manufacturing output of Microcyn\u00ae, or any other product candidate based on our platform that we may develop, could fail to meet required standards, our regulatory approvals could be delayed, denied or revoked, and commercialization of one or more of our Microcyn\u00ae-based products may be delayed or foregone. Manufacturing processes that are used to produce the smaller quantities of Microcyn\u00ae needed for clinical tests and current commercial sales may not be successfully scaled up to allow production of significant commercial quantities. Any failure to manufacture our products to required standards on a commercial scale could result in reduced revenues, delays in generating revenue and increased costs.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur ability to compete and to achieve and maintain profitability depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We currently rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, license agreements and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely upon unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. These measures may not be adequate to safeguard our Microcyn\u00ae Technology. If we do not protect our rights adequately, third parties could use our technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced.\nWe also have agreed to certain prohibitions on our intellectual property. Pursuant to the License and Supply Agreement we entered into with our formerly wholly-owned subsidiary, Ruthigen, we agreed to exclusively license certain of our proprietary technology to Ruthigen to enable Ruthigen\u2019s research and development and commercialization of RUT58-60, and any improvements to it, in the United States, Canada, European Union and Japan for certain invasive procedures in human treatment as defined in the License and Supply Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we are also prohibited from using the licensed proprietary technology to sell products that compete with Ruthigen\u2019s products within the defined territory.\nAlthough we have filed several U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our Microcyn\u00ae-based products, the manufacturing technology for making the products, and their uses, only eight U.S. patents have been issued from these applications to date.\nOur pending patent applications and any patent applications we may file in the future may not result in issued patents, and we do not know whether any of our in-licensed patents or any additional patents that might ultimately be issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or foreign regulatory body will protect our Microcyn\u00ae Technology. Any claims that are issued may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing substitutes and may be infringed, designed around, or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found to be invalid, or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. For example, our European patent that was initially issued on May 30, 2007 was revoked by the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office in December 2009 following opposition proceedings instituted by a competitor.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is more uncertain in part because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights, and we will not be able to ensure that:\n\u00b7 we were the first to invent the inventions described in patent applications;\n\u00b7 we were the first to file patent applications for inventions;\n\u00b7 others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our products without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 any patents licensed or issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u00b7 we will develop proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u00b7 the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nThe policies we use to protect our trade secrets may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our trade secrets by others. In addition, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements executed by our employees, consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosures.\nWe operate in the State of California. The laws of California prevent us from imposing a delay before an employee who may have access to trade secret and propriety know-how can commence employment with a competing company. Although we may be able to pursue legal action against competitive companies improperly using our proprietary information, we may not be aware of any use of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how until after significant damages has been done to our Company.\nWe cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation and use of our intellectual property in the United States, or in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming, costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and, in the case of patent infringement claims, the assessment of treble damages.\nOn occasion, we may receive notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. We may have disputes regarding intellectual property rights with the parties that have licensed those rights to us. We may also initiate claims to defend our intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, the outcome of such litigation may be unpredictable. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent, to the party claiming infringement, develop non-infringing technology, stop selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business. In addition, modifying our products to exclude infringing technologies could require us to seek re-approval or clearance from various regulatory bodies for our products, which would be costly and time consuming. Also, we may be unaware of pending patent applications that relate to our technology. Parties making infringement claims on future issued patents may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to generate revenue will be diminished if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from third-party payors of health care costs.\nThe continuing efforts of governmental and other third-party payors, including managed care organizations such as health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenue and profitability, and the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative or license partners and the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United States, governmental and private payors have limited the growth of health care costs through price regulation or controls, competitive pricing programs and drug rebate programs. Our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of our Microcyn\u00ae products and related treatment are obtained from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs.\nThere is significant uncertainty concerning third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved medical products and drugs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Also, the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, as well as the recently enacted \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d may result in lower prices for or rejection of our products. The cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nIn both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and therefore any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, became law in the United States. The goal of PPACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the PPACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of our Microcyn\u00ae products.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our Microcyn\u00ae products, due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nWe could be required to indemnify third parties for alleged intellectual property infringement, which could cause us to incur significant costs.\nSome of our distribution agreements contain commitments to indemnify our distributors against liability arising from infringement of third party intellectual property such as patents. We may be required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them or contribute to license fees they are required to pay. If we are forced to indemnify for claims or to pay license fees, our business and financial condition could be substantially harmed.\nA significant part of our business is conducted outside of the United States, exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the United States, which in turn could cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nWe have material international operations in Mexico and Europe. During the year ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 73% and 58% of our total product related revenue respectively were generated from sales outside of the United States. Our business is highly regulated for the use, marketing and manufacturing of our Microcyn\u00ae-based products both domestically and internationally. Our international operations are subject to risks, including:\n\u00b7 local political or economic instability;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulation;\n\u00b7 changes in import/export duties;\n\u00b7 trade restrictions;\n\u00b7 lack of experience in foreign markets;\n\u00b7 difficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries;\n\u00b7 work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;\n\u00b7 difficulties in collecting accounts receivables on a timely basis or at all; and\n\u00b7 adverse tax consequences or overlapping tax structures.\nWe plan to continue to market and sell our products internationally to respond to customer requirements and market opportunities. We currently have manufacturing facilities in Mexico and the United States. Establishing operations in any foreign country or region presents risks such as those described above as well as risks specific to the particular country or region. In addition, until a payment history is established over time with customers in a new geographic area or region, the likelihood of collecting receivables generated by such operations could be less than our expectations. As a result, there is a greater risk that the reserves set with respect to the collection of such receivables may be inadequate. If our operations in any foreign country are unsuccessful, we could incur significant losses and we may not achieve profitability.\nIn addition, changes in policies or laws of the United States or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, changes in regulations and the approval process, higher taxation, currency conversion limitations, restrictions on fund transfers or the expropriation of private enterprises, could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international expansion. If we fail to realize the anticipated revenue growth of our future international operations, our business and operating results could suffer.\nOur sales in international markets subject us to foreign currency exchange and other risks and costs which could harm our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are derived from outside the United States; primarily from Mexico and Europe. We anticipate that revenues from international customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Because we generate revenues in foreign currencies, we are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. The functional currency of our Mexican subsidiary is the Mexican Peso and the functional currency of our Netherlands subsidiary is the Euro. For the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the applicable period. If the U.S. dollar appreciates against the Mexican Peso or the Euro, as applicable, the revenues we recognize from sales by our subsidiaries will be adversely impacted. Foreign exchange gains or losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations in any given period could harm our operating results and negatively impact our revenues. Additionally, if the effective price of our products were to increase as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, demand for our products could decline and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a number of key customers who may not consistently purchase our products in the future and if we lose any one of these customers, our revenues may decline.\nAlthough we have a significant number of customers in each of the geographic markets that we operate in, we rely on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2015, More Pharma/Laboratorios Sanfer represented 47%, and Innovacyn represented 8% of our net revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2014, More Pharma represented 38%, and Innovacyn represented 23% of net revenues. In the future, a small number of customers may continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in any given period. These customers may not consistently purchase our products at a particular rate over any subsequent period. The loss of any of these customers could adversely affect our revenues.\nMore Pharma was recently acquired by Laboratorios Sanfer S.A. de C.V. All terms and conditions or our license, exclusive distribution and supply agreement with More Pharma will transfer to Laboratorios Sanfer and will remain in effect. However, we can give no assurance as to the timing or impact the acquisition will have on our operating results. In addition, Innovacyn notified us in April 2014 that it intended to transition to a new supplier for its animal care products. Because of Innovacyn\u2019s failure to perform under the arrangements, we terminated the agreements on December 15, 2014. Most of their animal care product was transitioned to the new supplier. As part of our search for new animal healthcare partners, on February 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement with SLA Brands, Inc. pursuant to which SLA will be our exclusive sales representative and distributor of pet specialty and equine products within the United States and Canada for pet and equine specialty retailers, catalogs and distributors. The agreement is effective through February 1, 2016, and will continue year to year until terminated by either party with 60 calendar days\u2019 notice. Our revenues in animal healthcare have been and will continue to be adversely impacted during this transition period.\nNegative economic conditions increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers\u2019 accounts receivable which would adversely affect our financial results.\nWe grant credit to our business customers, which are primarily located in Mexico, Europe and the United States. Collateral is generally not required for trade receivables. We maintain allowances for potential credit losses. At March 31, 2015, Laboratorios Sanfer, which recently acquired More Pharma, represented 56% and Dyamed represented 14% of our net accounts receivable balance. At March 31, 2014, More Pharma represented 44%, Exeltis represented 15%, and Innovacyn represented 12% of our net accounts receivable balance. While we believe we have a varied customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if current economic conditions disproportionately impact any one of our key customers, including reductions in their purchasing commitments to us or their ability to pay their obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and liquidity. We have not purchased insurance on our accounts receivable balances.\nMore Pharma was recently acquired by Laboratorios Sanfer S.A. de C.V. All terms and conditions or our license, exclusive distribution and supply agreement with More Pharma will transfer to Laboratorios Sanfer and will remain in effect. However, we can give no assurance as to the timing or impact the acquisition will have on our operating results. In addition, Quinnova was recently acquired by Everett Laboratories, Inc., now named Exeltis USA, Inc., a part of Chemo Group. On November 13, 2014, we received a letter from Exeltis claiming we are in breach of our terminated Exclusive Sales and Distribution Agreement, as further disclosed in the section Legal Proceedings elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We intend to defend this matter vigorously and do not believe an accrual for a potential loss relating to this matter is necessary at this time. We continue to allow Exeltis to sell the Alevicyn gel at this time while we are building our own direct sales force to sell new products, different than those products sold by Exeltis, including a prescription scar product approved by the FDA into the dermatology markets. While we believe this claim is without merit, there can be no assurances provided by us that the outcome of this matter will be favorable to us or will not have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position or results from operations. Exeltis continues to purchase products from us under a new, non-exclusive distribution agreement for sale to their customers under their own brand. In addition, Innovacyn notified us in April 2014 that it intended to transition to a new supplier for its animal care products. Because of Innovacyn\u2019s failure to perform under the arrangements, we terminated the agreements on December 15, 2014. Most of their animal care product was transitioned to the new supplier. As part of our search for new animal healthcare partners, on February 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement with SLA Brands, Inc. pursuant to which SLA will be our exclusive sales representative and distributor of pet specialty and equine products within the United States and Canada for pet and equine specialty retailers, catalogs and distributors. The agreement is effective through February 1, 2016, and will continue year to year until terminated by either party with 60 calendar days\u2019 notice. Our revenues in animal healthcare have been and will continue to be adversely impacted during this transition period.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team, any of our directors, or our highly skilled scientists, technicians and salespeople could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our executive management team, including Jim Schutz, our Chief Executive Officer, Robert Miller, our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Thornton, our Executive Vice President of International Operations and Sales, and Robert Northey, our Vice President of Research and Development. The efforts of these people will be critical to us as we continue to develop our products and attempt to commercialize products in the tissue and dermatology markets. If we were to lose one or more of these individuals, we might experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies.\nOur research and development programs depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and technicians. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical technology businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel. In addition, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain salespeople with extensive experience in advanced tissue care and dermatology, and who have close relationships with the medical community, including physicians and other medical staff. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting or retaining qualified salespeople, which could cause a delay or decline in the rate of adoption of our products. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to support our research, development and sales programs.\nThe dermatology, tissue and animal healthcare industries are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that are less expensive or more effective than any products that we may develop, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to stay at the forefront of technological change and maintain a competitive position. We compete with large healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, along with smaller or early-stage companies that have collaborative arrangements with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Our competitors may:\n\u00b7 develop and patent processes or products earlier than we will;\n\u00b7 develop and commercialize products that are less expensive or more efficient than any products that we may develop;\n\u00b7 obtain regulatory approvals for competing products more rapidly than we will; and\n\u00b7 improve upon existing technological approaches or develop new or different approaches that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.\nAs a result, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any future products.\nThe success of our research and development efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators to fully exploit our capabilities. If we are unable to establish collaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAn important element of our business strategy is to enter into collaborative or license arrangements under which we license our Microcyn\u00ae Technology to other parties for development and commercialization. We expect to seek collaborators for our drug candidates and for a number of our potential products because of the expense, effort and expertise required to conduct additional clinical trials and further develop those potential product candidates. Because collaboration arrangements are complex to negotiate, we may not be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements. If we need third party assistance in identifying and negotiating one or more acceptable arrangements, it might be costly. Also, we may not have products that are desirable to other parties, or we may be unwilling to license a potential product because the party interested in it is a competitor. The terms of any arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us. Alternatively, potential collaborators may decide against entering into an agreement with us because of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or for scientific, commercial or other reasons. If we are not able to establish collaborative agreements, we may not be able to develop and commercialize new products, which would adversely affect our business and our revenues.\nIn order for any of these collaboration or license arrangements to be successful, we must first identify potential collaborators or licensees whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours. We may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources, but also for expertise or economies of scale that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and for licenses to technology rights. However, it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing or resources that our collaborators or licensees devote to our programs or potential products. If our collaborators or licensees prove difficult to work with, are less skilled than we originally expected, or do not devote adequate resources to the program, the relationship will not be successful. If a business combination involving a collaborator or licensee and a third party were to occur, the effect could be to diminish, terminate or cause delays in development of a potential product.\nIf we are unable to comply with broad and complex federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including state and federal anti-kickback laws, we could face substantial penalties and our products could be excluded from government healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, which include, among other things, \u201canti-kickback\u201d laws that prohibit payments to induce the referral of products and services, and \u201cfalse claims\u201d statutes that prohibit the fraudulent billing of federal healthcare programs. Our operations are subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a criminal statute that, subject to certain statutory exceptions, prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward a person either (i) for referring an individual for the furnishing of items or services for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a government healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid, or (ii) for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of an item or service for which payment may be made under a government healthcare program. Because of the breadth of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was authorized to adopt regulations setting forth additional exceptions to the prohibitions of the statute commonly known as \u201csafe harbors.\u201d If all of the elements of an applicable safe harbor are fully satisfied, an arrangement will not be subject to prosecution under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nIn addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations of these laws, we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or regulation has been violated. The frequency of suits to enforce these laws has increased significantly in recent years and has increased the risk that a healthcare company will have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. We cannot assure you that we will not become subject to such litigation. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could harm our reputation, be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities with which we do business are found to have violated abuse laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us.\nOur efforts to discover and develop potential products may not lead to the discovery, development, commercialization or marketing of actual drug products.\nWe are currently engaged in a number of different approaches to discover and develop new product applications and product candidates. Discovery and development of potential drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and we do not know if our efforts will lead to discovery of any drug candidates that can be successfully developed and marketed. If our efforts do not lead to the discovery of a suitable drug candidate, we may be unable to grow our clinical pipeline or we may be unable to enter into agreements with collaborators who are willing to develop our drug candidates.\nWe may not be able to maintain sufficient product liability insurance to cover claims against us.\nProduct liability insurance for the healthcare industry is generally expensive to the extent it is available at all. We may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or be able to secure increased coverage if the commercialization of our products progresses, nor can we be sure that existing or future claims against us will be covered by our product liability insurance. Moreover, the existing coverage of our insurance policy or any rights of indemnification and contribution that we may have may not be sufficient to offset existing or future claims. A successful claim against us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insurance coverage and not subject to any indemnification or contribution could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf any of our third-party contractors fail to perform their responsibilities to comply with FDA rules and regulations, the manufacture, marketing and sales of our products could be delayed, which could decrease our revenues.\nSupplying the market with our Microcyn\u00ae Technology products requires us to manage relationships with an increasing number of collaborative partners, suppliers and third-party contractors. As a result, our success depends partially on the success of these third parties in performing their responsibilities to comply with FDA rules and regulations. Although we pre-qualify our contractors and we believe that they are fully capable of performing their contractual obligations, we cannot directly control the adequacy and timeliness of the resources and expertise that they apply to these activities. For example, we and our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA enforces the quality system regulation through inspections.\nIf any of our partners or contractors fail to perform their obligations in an adequate and timely manner, or fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s rules and regulations, including failure to comply with quality systems regulations or a corrective action submitted to the FDA after notification by the FDA of a deficiency is deemed insufficient, then the manufacture, marketing and sales of our products could be delayed. Our products could be detained or seized, the FDA could order a recall, or require our partner to replace or offer refunds for our products. The FDA could also require our partner, and, depending on our agreement with our partner, us, to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. If any of these events occur, the manufacture, marketing and sales of our products could be delayed which could decrease our revenues.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s rules and regulations and are subject to an FDA recall as part of an FDA enforcement action, the associated costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Company, our products, the manufacturing facilities for our products, the distribution of our products, and our promotion and marketing materials are subject to strict and continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with pre-approval and post-approval regulatory requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s rules and regulations, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FDA. The FDA could undertake regulatory actions, including seeking a consent decree, recalling or seizing our products, ordering a total or partial shutdown of production, delaying future marketing clearances or approvals, and withdrawing or suspending certain of our current products from the market. A product recall, restriction, or withdrawal could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, and lost revenues due to the unavailability of one or more of our products for a period of time, which could reduce profitability and cash flow. In addition, a product recall or withdrawal could divert significant management attention and financial resources. If any of our products are subject to an FDA recall, we could incur significant costs and suffer economic losses. Production of our products could be suspended and we could be required to establish inventory reserves to cover estimated inventory losses for all work-in-process and finished goods related to products we, or our third-party contractors, manufacture. A recall of a material amount of our products could have a significant, unfavorable impact on our future gross margins.\nIf our products fail to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations, or our products are deemed defective, we may be required to recall our products and we could suffer adverse public relations that could adversely impact our sales, operating results, and reputation which would adversely affect our business operations.\nWe may be exposed to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have mislabeled or misbranded our products or otherwise violated governmental regulations. Governmental authorities can also require product recalls or impose restrictions for product design, manufacturing, labeling, clearance, or other issues. For the same reasons, we may also voluntarily elect to recall, restrict the use of a product or withdraw products that we consider below our standards, whether for quality, packaging, appearance or otherwise, in order to protect our brand reputation.\nProduct recalls, product liability claims, even if unmerited or unsuccessful, or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brand with high quality and safe products may also result in adverse publicity, hurt the value of our brand, harm our reputation among our customers and other healthcare professionals who use or recommend the products, lead to a decline in consumer confidence in and demand for our products, and lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, performance, prospects, value, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe trading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. It is impossible to assure you that the market price of our shares of common stock will not fall in the future.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nFluctuations in our operating results may lead to fluctuations, including declines, in our share price. Our operating results and our share price may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7 demand by physicians, other medical staff and patients for our Microcyn\u00ae-based products;\n\u00b7 reimbursement decisions by third-party payors and announcements of those decisions;\n\u00b7 clinical trial results published by others in our industry and publication of results in peer-reviewed journals or the presentation at medical conferences;\n\u00b7 the inclusion or exclusion of our Microcyn\u00ae-based products in large clinical trials conducted by others;\n\u00b7 actual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 issues in manufacturing our product candidates or products;\n\u00b7 new or less expensive products and services or new technology introduced or offered by our competitors or by us;\n\u00b7 the development and commercialization of product enhancements;\n\u00b7 changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u00b7 delays in establishing new strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 costs associated with collaborations and new product candidates;\n\u00b7 introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 litigation or public concern about the safety of our product candidates or products;\n\u00b7 changes in recommendations of securities analysts or lack of analyst coverage;\n\u00b7 failure to meet analyst expectations regarding our operating results;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7 general market conditions.\nVariations in the timing of our future revenues and expenses could also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated earning shortfalls or losses. In addition, The NASDAQ Capital Market, in general, and the market for life sciences companies, in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law may make it more difficult for stockholders to change our management and may also make a takeover difficult.\nOur corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to change our management and may also enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board of Directors to issue and designate, without stockholder approval, the rights of up to 714,286 shares of convertible preferred stock, which rights could be senior to those of common stock;\n\u00b7 limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 advance notice procedures required for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before meetings of stockholders.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a publicly-held Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who became a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and cause us to take other corporate actions. In addition, the existence of these provisions, together with Delaware law, might hinder or delay an attempted takeover other than through negotiations with our Board of Directors.\nWe currently have significant \u201cequity overhang\u201d which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future.\nWe currently have significant \u201cequity overhang.\u201d The possibility that substantial amounts of our common stock may be issued to and then sold by investors, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, often called \u201cequity overhang,\u201d could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future. The consummation of the exercise of warrants for common stock would significantly increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.\nOur stockholders may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment if we issue additional shares of our capital stock or other securities convertible into common stock.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, allows us to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of our common stock and to issue and designate, without stockholder approval, the rights of up to 714,286 shares of preferred stock. In the event we issue additional shares of our capital stock, dilution to our stockholders could result. In addition, if we issue and designate a class of convertible preferred stock, these securities may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Additionally, if we issue preferred stock, it may convert into common stock at a ratio of 1:1 or greater because our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, allows us to designate a conversion ratio without limitations.\nShares issuable upon the conversion of warrants or the exercise of outstanding options may substantially increase the number of shares available for sale in the public market and depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had outstanding warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 7,740,514 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $2.50 per share. In addition, as of March 31, 2015, options to purchase an aggregate of 2,876,885 shares of our common stock were outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $6.96 per share and a weighted average contractual term of 7.82 years. In addition, 1,456,130 shares of our common stock were available on March 31, 2015 for future option grants under our Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, our Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan, and our 2016 Bonus Plan. To the extent any of these warrants or options are exercised and any additional options are granted and exercised, there will be further dilution to stockholders and investors. Until the options and warrants expire, these holders will have an opportunity to profit from any increase in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risks of ownership. Holders of options and warrants may convert or exercise these securities at a time when we could obtain additional capital on terms more favorable than those provided by the options or warrants. The exercise of the options and warrants will dilute the voting interest of the owners of presently outstanding shares by adding a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock.\nWe have filed several registration statements with the SEC, so that substantially all of the shares of our common stock which are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and options may be sold in the public market. The sale of our common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of the warrants and options described above, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91742, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SNOA"}
