{"cik": "1040850", "company": "AGRITEK HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information provided to you in this document, including information in the section of this document entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nInvestors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. Our business, financial condition and/or results of operation may be materially adversely affected by the nature and impact of these risks. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nRisk Related to Our Company\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe incurred a net loss of $2,977,889 and $2,074,161 for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Because of our continued operating losses, negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficit, in their report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding their substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will continue to experience net operating losses in the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, increasing sales or obtaining loan from various financial institutions where possible. Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.\nFederal regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of medical marijuana laws and regulations may negatively impact our revenues and profits.\nCurrently, there are 26 states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, under the Controlled Substances Act (the \u201cCSA\u201d), the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited. Until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical marijuana, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and we may be deemed to be facilitating the selling or distribution of drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the Company. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of congressional activity, judicial holdings and stated federal policy remains uncertain.\nFederal authorities have not focused their resources on such tangential or secondary violations of the Act, nor have they threatened to do so, with respect to the leasing of real property or the sale of equipment that might be used by medical cannabis gardeners, or with respect to any supplies marketed to participants in the emerging medical cannabis industry. We are unaware of such a broad application of the CSA by federal authorities, and we believe that such an attempted application would be unprecedented.\nThe Company may provide services to and potentially handle monies for businesses in the legal cannabis industry.\nSelling or distributing medical or retail cannabis is deemed to be illegal under the Federal Controlled Substances Act even though such activities may be permissible under state law. A risk exists that our lending and services could be deemed to be facilitating the selling or distribution of cannabis in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act, or to constitute aiding or abetting, or being an accessory to, a violation of that Act. Such a finding, claim, or accusation would likely severely limit the Company\u2019s ability to continue with its operations and may result in our investors losing all of their investment in our Company.\nThe legal cannabis industry faces an uncertain legal environment on state, federal, and local levels.\nAlthough we continually monitor the most recent legal developments affecting the legal cannabis industry, the legal environment in California and elsewhere could shift in a manner not currently contemplated by the Company. For example, while we think there will always be a place for compliance-related services, broader state and federal legalization could render the compliance landscape significantly less technical, which would render our suite of compliance services less valuable and marketable. Lending money to legal cannabis participants could also be subject to legal challenge if the federal government or another jurisdiction decides to more actively enforce applicable laws. These unknown legal developments could directly and indirectly harm our business and results of operations.\nProfit sharing, distributions, and equity ownership in California medical marijuana dispensaries and growing operations are not permissible.\nThe Company does not currently maintain an ownership interest in legal cannabis dispensaries or growing operations in California or elsewhere. We believe such ownership is not permitted by applicable law. Investors should be aware that the Company will not engage in such activity until such time as it is legally permissible. If the applicable laws make it so that the Company is unable to own interests in legal cannabis dispensaries in growing operations ever, the Company may not be able to attain its financial projections, and thus, this would directly and indirectly harm our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on third party providers for a reliable Internet infrastructure and the failure of these third parties, or the Internet in general, for any reason would significantly impair our ability to conduct our business.\nWe outsource all of our data center facility management to third parties who host the actual servers and provide power and security in multiple data centers in each geographic location. These third party facilities require uninterrupted access to the Internet. If the operation of our servers is interrupted for any reason, including natural disaster, financial insolvency of a third party provider, or malicious electronic intrusion into the data center, our business would be significantly damaged. If either a third party facility failed, or our ability to access the Internet was interfered with because of the failure of Internet equipment in general or we become subject to malicious attacks of computer intruders, our business and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nThe gathering, transmission, storage and sharing or use of personal information could give rise to liabilities or additional costs of operation as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements, civil actions or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nWe transmit and plan to store a large volume of personal information in the course of providing our services. Federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers and their users. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, we may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our customers from the costs or consequences of inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of their customers\u2019 personal data which we store or handle as part of providing our services.\nThe interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data retention laws and regulations are currently unsettled particularly with regard to location-based services, use of customer data to target advertisements and communication with consumers via mobile devices. Such laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAs privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of personal information. These and other privacy concerns, including security breaches, could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the U.S., we have voluntarily agreed to comply with wireless carrier technological and other requirements for access to their customers\u2019 mobile devices, and also trade association guidelines and codes of conduct addressing the provision of location-based services, delivery of promotional content to mobile devices and tracking of users or devices for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising. We could be adversely affected by changes to these requirements, guidelines and codes, including in ways that are inconsistent with our practices or in conflict with the rules or guidelines in other jurisdictions.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-An Integrated Framework. We are planning to engage in developing a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and shareholder litigation.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nWe monitor our capital adequacy on an ongoing basis. To the extent that our funds are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through corporate finance transactions or curtail our growth and reduce our liabilities. Any equity, hybrid or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAlthough there is presently a market for our common stock, the price of our common stock may be extremely volatile and investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above their purchase price, or at all. We anticipate that the market may be potentially highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially because of:\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our future business and operating results;\n\u2022 Changes in or failure to meet market expectations;\n\u2022 Fluctuations in stock market price and volume\nOur Chief Executive Officer, B. Michael Friedman, holds Series B Preferred Stock which will provide him continuing voting control over the Company and, as a result, he will exercise significant control over corporate decisions.\nB. Michael Friedman, our President, Chief Executive Office and sole Director owns 100% of Class B Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d). Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, the Series B Preferred Stock has the right to vote in aggregate, on all shareholder matters equal to 51% of the total vote, no matter how many shares of common stock or other voting stock of the Company are issued or outstanding in the future. The Series B Preferred Stock has a right to vote on all matters presented or submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval in pari passu with the common stockholders, and not as a separate class. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock have the right to cast votes for each share of Series B Preferred Stock held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of common stockholders, including the election of directors. There is no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock vote together with all other classes and series of common stock of the Company as a single class on all actions to be taken by the common stockholders except to the extent that voting as a separate class or series is required by law.\nAs a result of the above, Mr. Friedman exercises control in determining the outcome of corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. Any investors who purchase shares will be minority shareholders and as such will have no say in the direction of the Company and the election of Directors. Investors in the Company should keep in mind that even if you own shares of the Company's common stock and wish to vote them at annual or special shareholder meetings, your shares will have no effect on the outcome of corporate decisions or the election of Directors. Furthermore, investors should be aware that Mr. Friedman may choose to elect new Directors to the Board of Directors of the Company and/or take the Company in a new business direction altogether, and, as a result, current shareholders of the Company will have little to no say in such matters.\nAs a public company, we will incur substantial expenses.\nThe U.S. securities laws require, among other things, review, audit, and public reporting of our financial results, business activities, and other matters. Recent SEC regulation, including regulation enacted as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has also substantially increased the accounting, legal, and other costs related to becoming and remaining an SEC reporting company. If we do not have current information about our Company available to market makers, they will not be able to trade our stock. The public company costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privately-held. These increased costs may be material and may include the hiring of additional employees and/or the retention of additional advisors and professionals. Our failure to comply with the federal securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against us and/or our officers and directors, which could have a detrimental effect on our business and finances, the value of our stock, and the ability of stockholders to resell their stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\n\u201cFINRA\u201d has adopted rules that relate to the application of the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules in trading our securities and require that a broker/dealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer, prior to recommending the investment. Prior to recommending speculative, low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker/dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative, low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker/dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock. Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker/dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a shareholder\u2019s ability to resell shares of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is currently deemed to be \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which makes it more difficult for investors to sell their shares.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is currently subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market or other national securities exchange and trades at less than $5.00 per share or that have tangible net worth of less than $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company has been operating for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than \u201cestablished customers\u201d complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If the Company remains subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for the Company\u2019s securities. If the Company\u2019s securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of the Company\u2019s securities.\nWe have raised capital through the use of convertible debt instruments that causes substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nBecause of the size of our Company and its status as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as well as the current economy and difficulties in companies our size finding adequate sources of funding, we have been forced to raise capital through the issuance of convertible notes and other debt instruments. These debt instruments carry favorable conversion terms to their holders of up to 50% discounts to the market price of our common stock on conversion and in some cases provide for the immediate sale of our securities into the open market. Accordingly, this has caused dilution to our stockholders in 2016 and may for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $826,480 in convertible debt and potential convertible debt outstanding. This convertible debt balance as well as additional convertible debt we incur in the future will cause substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nBecause we are quoted on the OTCQB instead of an exchange or national quotation system, our investors may have a tougher time selling their stock or experience negative volatility on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB. The OTCQB is often highly illiquid, in part because it does not have a national quotation system by which potential investors can follow the market price of shares except through information received and generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is a greater chance of volatility for securities that are quoted on the OTCQB as compared to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility may be caused by a variety of factors, including the lack of readily available price quotations, the absence of consistent administrative supervision of bid and ask quotations, lower trading volume, and market conditions. Investors in our common stock may experience high fluctuations in the market price and volume of the trading market for our securities. These fluctuations, when they occur, have a negative effect on the market price for our securities. Accordingly, our stockholders may not be able to realize a fair price from their shares when they determine to sell them or may have to hold them for a substantial period of time until the market for our common stock improves.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We may not have sufficient funds to legally pay dividends. Even if funds are legally available to pay dividends, we may nevertheless decide in our sole discretion not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors our board of directors may consider relevant. There is no assurance that we will pay any dividends in the future, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.\nOur operating history and lack of profits which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common shares at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you. The market price for our common shares is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly traded public float.\nThe market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, our common shares are sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price. Secondly, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our limited operating history and lack of profits to date, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common shares will be at any time, including as to whether our common shares will sustain their current market prices, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common shares for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.\nShareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.\nFederal regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of marijuana laws and regulations may negatively impact our revenues and profits.\nCurrently, there are twenty six states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. There are currently two states that have laws and/or regulation that permits consumer use of cannabis for commercial and recreational purposes. Many other states are considering legislation to similar effect. As of the date of this writing, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of customers of the Company to invest in or lease properties from the Company that may be used in connection with cannabis. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the Company.\nWe may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities or restrictions related to properties that we acquire for which we may have limited or no recourse.\nAssets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers. Unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties, unpaid real estate tax, or utilities charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable, clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations, claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities and tax liabilities, among other things.\nOur revenue and expenses are not directly correlated, and because a large percentage of our costs and expenses are fixed, we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset declines in our revenue.\nMost of the expenses associated with our business, such as acquisition costs, renovation and maintenance costs, real estate taxes, personal and ad valorem taxes, insurance, utilities, employee wages and benefits and other general corporate expenses are fixed and do not necessarily decrease with a reduction in revenue from our business. Our expenses and ongoing capital expenditures will also be affected by inflationary increases and certain of our cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. By contrast, as described above, our rental income will be affected by many factors beyond our control such as the availability of alternative rental properties and economic conditions in our target markets. As a result, we may not be able to fully offset rising costs and capital spending by higher lease rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution. In addition, state and local regulations may require us to maintain properties that we own, even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the value of the property or any potential benefit from leasing the property.\nOur future portfolio consists of properties geographically concentrated in certain markets and any adverse developments in local economic conditions, the demand for commercial property in these markets or natural disasters may negatively affect our operating results.\nOur future portfolio consists of properties geographically concentrated in Colorado. As such, we are susceptible to local economic conditions, other regulations, the supply of and demand for commercial rental properties and natural disasters in these areas. If there is a downturn in the economy, an oversupply of or decrease in demand for commercial rental properties in these markets or natural disasters in these geographical areas, our business could be materially adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more geographically diversified.\nWe may be subject to losses that are either uninsurable, not economically insurable or that are in excess of our insurance coverage.\nOur properties may be subject to environmental liabilities and we will be exposed to personal liability for accidents which may occur on our properties. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all damages or losses from these events, or it may not be economically prudent to purchase insurance for certain types of losses. As a result, we may be required to incur significant costs in the event of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters or events which result in environmental or personal liability. We may not carry or may discontinue certain types of insurance coverage on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies in our judgment exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. If we experience losses that are uninsured or exceed policy limits, we could incur significant uninsured costs or liabilities, lose the capital invested in the properties, and lose the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, our environmental or personal liability may result in losses substantially in excess of the value of the related property.\nCompliance with new or existing laws, regulations and covenants that are applicable to our future properties, including permit, license and zoning requirements, may adversely affect our ability to make future acquisitions or renovations, result in significant costs or delays and adversely affect our growth strategy.\nOur future properties are subject to various covenants and local laws and regulatory requirements, including permitting and licensing requirements. Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties. We cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations, or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs. Our failure to obtain permits, licenses and zoning approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPoor tenant selection and defaults by renters may negatively affect our financial performance and reputation.\nOur success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified tenants for our properties. This will depend, in turn, upon our ability to screen applicants, identify good tenants and avoid tenants who may default. We will inevitably make mistakes in our selection of tenants, and we may rent to tenants whose default on our leases or failure to comply with the terms of the lease negatively affect our financial performance, reputation and the quality and value of our properties. For example, tenants may default on payment of rent, make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements, make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities, make use of our properties for illegal purposes, damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties which may not be fully covered by security deposits, refuse to leave the property when the lease is terminated, engage in violence or similar disturbances, disturb nearby residents with noise, trash, odors or eyesores, fail to comply with regulations, sublet to less desirable individuals in violation of our leases, or permit unauthorized persons to live therein. The process of evicting a defaulting renter from a commercial property can be adversarial, protracted and costly. Furthermore, some tenants facing eviction may damage or destroy the property. Damage to our properties may significantly delay re-leasing after eviction, necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income or value of the property, resulting in a lower than expected rate of return. In addition, we will incur turnover costs associated with re-leasing the properties such as marketing and brokerage commissions and will not collect revenue while the property sits vacant. Although we will attempt to work with tenants to prevent such damage or destruction, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in all or most cases. Such tenants will not only cause us not to achieve our financial objectives for the properties, but may subject us to liability, and may damage our reputation with our other tenants and in the communities where we do business.\nDeclining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur success will depend upon our ability to acquire rental properties at attractive valuations, such that we can earn a satisfactory return on the investment primarily through rental income and secondarily through increases in the value of the properties. If we overpay for properties or if their value subsequently drops or fails to rise because of market factors, we will not achieve our financial objectives.\nWe will periodically review the value of our properties to determine whether their value, based on market factors, projected income and generally accepted accounting principles, has permanently decreased such that it is necessary or appropriate to take an impairment loss in the relevant accounting period. Such a loss would cause an immediate reduction of net income in the applicable accounting period and would be reflected in a decrease in our balance sheet assets. The reduction of net income from an impairment loss could lead to a reduction in our dividends, both in the relevant accounting period and in future periods. Even if we do not determine that it is necessary or appropriate to record an impairment loss, a reduction in the intrinsic value of a property would become manifest over time through reduced income from the property and would therefore affect our earnings and financial condition.\nIncreasing real estate taxes, fees and insurance costs may negatively impact our financial results.\nThe cost of real estate taxes and insuring our properties is a significant component of our expenses. Real estate taxes, fees and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases, which can be outside of our control. If the costs associated with real estate taxes, fees and assessments or insurance should rise significantly and we are unable to raise rents to offset such increases, our results of operations would be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth, which requires significant resources, and our results may be adversely affected.\nWe plan to continue our acquisition strategy, which will demand significant resources and attention and may affect our financial performance. Our future operating results depend on our ability to effectively manage this growth, which is dependent, in part, upon the ability of the Company to:\n\u2022 Funding and Financing Solutions for Agricultural Land and Properties zoned for the regulated Cannabis Industry.\n\u2022 Compliance Consulting and Certification Solutions\n\u2022 Dispensary and Retail Solutions\n\u2022 Commercial Production and Equipment Build Out Solutions\n\u2022 Banking and Payment Processing Solutions\n\u2022 Multichannel Supply Chain Solutions\n\u2022 Branding, Marketing and Sales Solutions of proprietary product lines\n\u2022 Consumer Product Solutions\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve these results or that we may otherwise be able to manage our growth effectively. Any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nShould one or more of the foregoing risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.", "PERMNO": 86063, "SIC": 5140, "TIC": "AGTK"}
