{"cik": "355777", "company": "LOJACK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our equity securities could decline. Our shareholders should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading \u201cWarning Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 7 before deciding to invest in our securities.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE PENDING TRANSACTION WITH CALAMP\nFailure to complete the pending transaction with CalAmp could negatively impact our business, financial results and stock price.\nOn February 1, 2016, we entered into a merger agreement with CalAmp Corp., pursuant to which CalAmp will acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $6.45 per share in cash through a tender offer and second-step merger. Completion of the pending transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the tender of a number of our shares that, together with other shares owned or to be acquired by CalAmp and its subsidiaries, represent at least two thirds of the total number of our outstanding shares on a fully-diluted basis (excluding shares underlying equity awards that will be cancelled upon completion of the tender offer). If the transaction with CalAmp is not completed, our business, financial results and stock price may be adversely affected and we will be subject to certain risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nIf the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay CalAmp a termination fee of $4.5 million;\n\u2022\nWe will be required to pay various costs relating to the pending transaction regardless of whether it is completed, such as significant fees and expenses for legal, accounting, financial advisory, and printing services;\n\u2022\nMatters relating to the pending transaction may require substantial time and effort from our management and other employees, which time and effort could have otherwise been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to LoJack;\n\u2022\nWe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our employees, customers, partners, licensees, and suppliers if the transaction is not completed; and\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to litigation related to a failure to complete the transaction or to enforce our rights under the merger agreement.\nThe pending transaction with CalAmp may not be completed and our business could be impaired if CalAmp is unable to acquire a sufficient number of shares in the tender offer.\nIf CalAmp, through its wholly owned subsidiary, owns at least 90% of our issued and outstanding shares following the tender offer, the proposed merger can be effected as a \u201cshort form merger\u201d under Massachusetts law. A short form merger would enable CalAmp to complete the acquisition of LoJack without any action on the part of the other holders of our shares. If CalAmp satisfies the minimum condition for completion of the tender offer but does not own 90% of the issued and outstanding shares following such completion, including through the exercise of a top-up option and any subsequent offering period, we would be required to obtain the approval of our shareholders to consummate the merger. Although this would not prevent the merger from occurring because CalAmp would control a sufficient number of our shares to approve the merger agreement, it would delay the completion of the merger. If less than the required minimum number of shares are tendered, then neither the tender offer nor the merger may be completed, which could cause significant uncertainty for LoJack and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the transaction with CalAmp is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the pending transaction with CalAmp on our employees, customers, partners, licensees, and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers, partners, licensees, suppliers, and others that deal with us to defer entering into contracts with, or making other decisions concerning, LoJack or to seek to change existing business relationships with us. The loss or deterioration of relationships with significant customers, partners, licensees or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on LoJack. In addition, the merger agreement restricts us from taking specified actions while the transaction is pending without the consent of CalAmp. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the pending transaction or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute on our business strategy.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur business and results of operations are substantially dependent on new vehicle sales levels in the United States and the sales of LoJack products in our particular geographic markets.\nOur business depends on the automotive industry for new vehicle sales in the United States and sales of LoJack products in our particular geographic markets. For instance, a great majority of our domestic gross unit sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 were made through a distribution network consisting of automobile dealers that offer LoJack Units as an option on both their new and used automobiles. Sales levels in the automotive industry may be impacted by, among other things:\n\u2022\nChanging economic conditions, such as the unfavorable economic conditions which have affected the United States or other parts of the world such as China, including low economic growth, high unemployment, and the decline in wealth resulting from depressed housing and equity markets;\n\u2022\nConcerns over sovereign debt levels in the United States and/or Europe, and the possible negative implications to banks and the global economy arising out of the European debt crisis, which could have an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, credit availability, consumer confidence and the demand for new and used vehicles;\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates or in the availability of financing for vehicles and accessories, which can significantly impact new vehicle sales due to the direct relationship between interest rates and monthly loan payments and the impact on customers' borrowing capacity and disposable income; and\n\u2022\nConsumer spending in the automotive industry, as such spending is often discretionary and may decline during economic downturns when consumers have less disposable income.\nWe believe that these factors, among others such as fuel prices, manufacturer incentives (and consumers' reactions to such offers), inventory availability, product quality and affordability and innovation, could affect vehicle sales levels and sales of LoJack products. Our product sales may differ from overall automotive industry sales due to particular economic conditions and other factors in the geographic markets in which we operate. A decline in the automotive industry or in new or used vehicle sales in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny negative impact on the sales, licensing and marketing efforts of our principal products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends primarily on the sale, licensing and market acceptance of our principal product, the LoJack System and related products and services, in the United States and 30 foreign countries. Because our revenue is dependent on the success of our principal products, any factor affecting their marketability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could harm the successful sale and licensing of our products include, among others:\n\u2022\nIf automobile dealers with whom we have relationships stop selling or emphasizing our products in connection with their vehicle sales;\n\u2022\nIf we become over-weighted in low growth vehicle brands or models and/or under-weighted in high growth vehicle brands or models;\n\u2022\nIf law enforcement agencies that currently utilize our LoJack System in the United States do not renew our service contracts or if such law enforcement agencies grant service contracts to our competitors;\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to maintain the FCC frequency used for operation of the LoJack System;\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to fully develop and sustain a market for our products and services in Italy;\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase acceptance in the consumer market for our LoJack products and services;\n\u2022\nIf our foreign licensees are unable to establish or maintain a market for our products in their jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to develop enhancements to our products as required by market demand;\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nIf one or more of our competitors introduces a product or system that renders our products obsolete or less competitive;\n\u2022\nIf third parties are able to locate or impair the function of LoJack Units or Boomerang Units in vehicles or impair the functioning of the LoJack or Boomerang Systems, potentially adversely affecting our recovery rates; or\n\u2022\nIf vehicle manufacturers adopt practices, implement new technologies or create systems which adversely affect the efficacy of or the need for the LoJack System.\nOur inability to maintain and grow sales from our pre-install program could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe achieved a significant portion of our domestic sales in 2015 through our pre-install program with certain automobile dealerships. Pre-install sales accounted for 61% and 56% of our unit sales in the domestic dealer channel for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This program provides for LoJack Units to be installed on automobiles in a dealer\u2019s inventory in advance of the sale or lease of such automobiles to customers. The dealer makes a profit upon the sale of the LoJack Unit through to the customer at the time of sale or lease of the pre-loaded vehicle. Decreased vehicle margins resulting from price transparency and increased brand competition have put pressure on dealerships to increase profit contributions in other areas of the dealership, including after-market products such as the LoJack System. These factors have contributed to increased dealer receptivity to our pre-install program and increased volumes within selling dealers over the past three fiscal years. Negative changes in the automotive industry or the market for after-market products could result in an unwillingness of dealers to participate in our pre-install program because of the increased financial exposure that they may face from LoJack Units not being sold through to customers. In addition, dealers may decide not to participate in our pre-install program if we are unable to successfully execute and support all phases of the program, including installation of the LoJack Units and training of dealer employees. A decrease in sales through our pre-install program could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable results of pending legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen which are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. Some of these matters are described in greater detail in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d below. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we have filed, and may in the future file, legal proceedings against third parties or make counterclaims against third parties in proceedings that they initiate. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in such efforts, either on the merits or with respect to particular relief sought, nor any assurance that any awarded damages ultimately will be paid to us.\nWe face significant competition from OEMs and makers of location based services and automobile products to be sold by automobile dealers.\nWe compete with other makers of stolen vehicle recovery devices, but more significantly, we also face competition from all products which are sold by automobile dealers in the after-market space, including vehicle security devices, GPS products and navigation systems. Such products compete with us for consumer funds in the automobile products after-market. We also face competition from OEMs, including divisions of well-known automobile manufacturers, who have diversified their product offerings and place increased sales pressure on dealers to purchase OEM-supplied or approved equipment and products. Our ability to adequately respond to changes in the automotive market and to compete effectively is key to our success, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond successfully to market changes in the future.\nOur growth depends in part on the development, production and market acceptance of new products and sales channels which we cannot assure will happen successfully.\nTo maintain competitiveness in our industry, we must support and enhance our existing products and develop new products in response to market demands. Product development involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty due to unforeseen difficulties and costs. We may not be successful in developing, marketing and releasing new products that we believe are necessary to respond to technological developments, evolving industry standards, increasing sophistication and complexities in vehicles or changing customer preferences. In addition, our new product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If the release date of any future products or enhancements is delayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released, we may not be able to recover our research and development costs and our competitive position in the marketplace may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand and product quality, it may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have established a strong reputation for the quality and effectiveness of our products in the tracking and recovery of stolen mobile assets. Our continued success depends on our ability to market our products and develop sales techniques tailored to the needs of our customers, maintain our brand image for our existing products and effectively establish brand image for new products and brand extensions. Brand value is largely based on consumer perceptions. Even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value. Product quality issues could tarnish the image of the LoJack brand and may reduce demand for our products and cause consumers to choose other products. Poor product quality, poor installation practices, or low recovery rates could affect our profitability and could negatively affect brand image and our reputation. Damage to our\nreputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nWe are dependent upon the success and continued relationships with the large regional or national dealer groups in the United States which currently sell our products.\nOur revenue in the United States is derived primarily from the sale of LoJack Units, LoJack Early Warning Units and related products and extended product and recovery warranties to automobile dealers and retailers who resell the units to consumers. In 2015, approximately 84% of our revenue in the United States originated through this distribution network of automobile dealers which is geographically diverse, but which includes several large national dealer groups. Our business could be materially adversely impacted by the loss of business with any of the large regional or national dealer groups with whom we conduct business. To the extent that these dealer groups are affiliated with certain automobile brands, our business could also be adversely impacted by a decline in consumer demand for these brands.\nWe are subject to financial and reputational risks due to product quality and liability issues.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers of our LoJack Units and critical components of LoJack Units. Product quality and liability issues present significant risks. Our efforts and the efforts of our third party suppliers to maintain product quality may not be successful. From time to time, we receive reports from our customers, licensees or partners regarding potential quality issues with respect to our products or components of our products. As previously reported, we have confirmed that certain batteries manufactured by our former battery manufacturer that were included in certain self-powered LoJack Units sold in the United States and to our international licensees are exhibiting variability in performance that could impact the ability of the LoJack Unit to transmit a signal when called upon for stolen vehicle recovery. As a result of this battery evaluation, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, costs related to a quality assurance notification program in the United States for vehicle customers currently under warranty, quality assurance programs in other countries and markets, and other business concessions. Costs and expenses related to the battery evaluation or other potential quality issues also may include, among other things, those related to quality assurance programs, product or battery replacements, warranty claims, extension of product warranties, payments or other concessions to our B2B customers, legal or other professional fees, litigation, and harm to our brand image and reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A product quality issue also could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business, result in lower recovery rates for stolen vehicles, and/or interfere with our manufacturing plans and product delivery obligations as we seek to replace or repair affected products. Although we may have product liability insurance with respect to certain of our products, a number of criteria need to be met in order for our coverage to apply. If we do not have insurance sufficient to cover the costs associated with a product quality issue, the expenses we would incur in connection with a product quality issue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply quality infrastructure components for our principal products. If our suppliers cannot provide the components or services we require and in such quality as we expect, our ability to market and sell our products could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers of our LoJack Units, a critical component of our LoJack System. If our suppliers fail to supply these components in a timely manner that meets our quantity, quality, cost requirements, or technical specifications, we may not be able to access alternative sources of these components within a reasonable period of time or at commercially reasonable rates. Our manufacturers are located outside the United States and their facilities are geographically concentrated in a specific region. We outsource much of the transportation and logistics management and while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they reduce our direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may reduce our flexibility and ability to quickly respond to changing conditions. A reduction or interruption in the supply of LoJack Units, or a significant increase in the price of these units, could have a material adverse effect on our marketing and sales initiatives, which could adversely affect our financial results domestically and internationally. Our agreements with our manufacturers include warranties and quality control measures, but any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nMoreover, we may introduce new component suppliers from time to time, including battery manufacturers. Any disruption in the production of batteries or other components for LoJack Units, failure of any batteries or other components to meet our specifications or other issues in the introduction of a new supplier could cause us to incur material cost increases or create supply disruptions to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on sales of LoJack Units and our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require additional financing to make future investments in new technologies, products, or international markets, to acquire complementary businesses, or to provide additional working capital in the event that the pending transaction with CalAmp\nwere not to be successfully completed. In the future, we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to fund our activities. If we issue additional equity securities, shareholder value will be diluted and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. In addition, if we raise funds through debt financings, we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive and other covenants, which could negatively impact our business. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, we may not be able to make strategic investments, develop or enhance our products, take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities, respond to competitive challenges or unanticipated industry changes, or fund our anticipated working capital needs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2015, we entered into a loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, with respect to a new revolving credit facility to replace our prior credit facility. The loan agreement provides for maximum borrowings in an amount equal to the lesser of $12 million and a borrowing base calculated based on certain accounts receivable. These limitations on our borrowing could result in inadequate funds to make anticipated investments in our business, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, the loan agreement contains covenants, including a minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant. If we do not generate sufficient earnings, we may fail to comply with our loan covenants and such failure could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could adversely impact our financial condition\nThe steps we have taken and may take in the future to reduce our cost structure may be insufficient to result in consistent profitability.\nDuring 2014 and 2015, we implemented programs to operate more efficiently and better align our cost structure with our plans for future growth, including the elimination or alignment of positions within our company and a plan to consolidate our Canadian operations to reduce costs and more closely align this business with our U.S. operations. Risks associated with these actions include incurrence of restructuring charges, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business. Because of these and other factors, we cannot predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of our restructuring measures, and if we do not, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, the steps we have taken and may take in the future may not reduce our cost structure to a level appropriate in relation to our future sales and, therefore, these anticipated cost reductions may be insufficient to result in consistent profitability.\nWe may not be able to maintain or improve our historical gross margin levels.\nDuring 2014, our gross margin decreased compared to 2013 primarily due to costs related to our restructuring activities and our quality assurance notification program. Price concessions to our international licensees relating to the battery evaluation may result in future margin erosion with respect to sales to those licensees. In addition, our gross margin is impacted by changes in product mix, customer mix and geographic location of sales. In particular, our margin tends to be lower with respect to sales through our pre-install program, and we may experience lower margins with respect to sales of our telematics products and services as we grow this portion of our business. While we have taken steps to try to mitigate margin erosion, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain or improve our gross margins will adversely affect our financial results.\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key employees, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur success as a company depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive officers. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our strategic initiatives. Our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to greater competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any unplanned turnover could diminish our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.\nFailure to procure and maintain contracts with local law enforcement agencies would materially adversely affect the marketability of the LoJack System and would inhibit sales in the United States and Italy.\nIn the United States and Italy, the LoJack System is designed to be integrated into existing law enforcement computer systems and telecommunication systems and procedures. A LoJack Unit will not be effective if the vehicle in which it is installed is located outside a covered jurisdiction where we have procured an agreement with local law enforcement agencies. We have agreements covering 29 states and the District of Columbia in the United States and certain geographical areas of Italy. These agreements are generally for terms of up to five years. Renewal or extension of any of these agreements, either formally or informally, may be subject to competitive bidding. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew or extend our existing agreements with local law enforcement agencies or obtain agreements in new target jurisdictions in the future. Our competitors may seek agreements with local law enforcement agencies and if they obtain such agreements, we may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we are unable to procure and maintain contracts with local law enforcement agencies in our existing and target markets, our financial results will be materially and adversely affected.\nRegulations applicable to the sale of extended warranty products could materially impact our business and results of operations.\nWe offer warranty products that may be purchased as a supplement to the original purchaser\u2019s warranty. These products are sold primarily through the Financing and Insurance, or F&I, departments of automobile dealers and are subject to complex federal and state laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which these products are offered will not seek to regulate or restrict these products. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines or other penalties including orders by state regulators to discontinue sales of the warranty products in one or more jurisdictions. Such a result could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently transfer the majority of the administration and liability obligations associated with these warranty products to a third party upon purchase by the consumer. State laws and regulations, however, may limit or condition our ability to transfer these administration and liability obligations to third parties, which could in turn impact the way revenue is recognized from these products. Failure to comply with these laws could result in fines or other penalties, including orders by state regulators to discontinue sales of these product offerings as currently structured. Such a result could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations that restrict the importation of our products in certain countries could materially impact our business and results of operations.\nWe face uncertainty regarding developing governmental regulations in Argentina that may affect sales to our licensee in that country. In February 2012, Argentine authorities began requiring all importers to request and receive approval from the Argentine Tax and Customs Authority prior to each import transaction. As a result, during the remainder of 2012 and early 2013, we did not ship any units to Argentina. Our Argentine licensee informed us that it and its affiliates had developed several commodity export programs with the expectation that our licensee would be permitted to import a dollar amount of goods approximately equivalent to the dollar amount of exports our licensee and its affiliates generate. Subsequently, we were able to make several shipments of product to our licensee in Argentina in 2013, 2014 and 2015. However, the amount of these shipments was less than the dollar amount that our licensee told us it had generated to date in exports. Future sales to our Argentine licensee will remain contingent upon the ability of our licensee to comply with government trade policies regulating the importation of manufactured goods. If our Argentine licensee and its affiliates are unable to generate significant exports or if the government changes its policies, we may not be able to ship products to Argentina at all or in volumes consistent with prior years. Any regulations in Argentina or other countries in which our licensees are located that prevent or limit our ability to sell products to our licensees in those countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with the operations in our International segment could adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nOur revenue and profit growth is partially dependent on the continuation of our license agreements with our international licensees and the success of their operations. Changes to our licensees\u2019 existing management teams, or failure of our licensees to meet their working capital needs or execute fully on their existing business plans, could negatively impact: (1) the value of our equity investments; (2) the collectability of our receivables; and (3) our target revenue and profits from our International segment; and could also delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenue in key international markets. Moreover, our licensees\u2019 operations and our own international operations expose us to risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States including:\n\u2022\nPotentially weak protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nEconomic and geo-political instability and fluctuations;\n\u2022\nImport or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nTrade or currency restrictions;\n\u2022\nBusiness models that are more heavily weighted towards periodic payments rather than receiving full payment upon sale of the product;\n\u2022\nChanges in regulatory requirements, tariffs or government mandates;\n\u2022\nSeasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world, such as during the summer months in Europe;\n\u2022\nIn-country pricing which may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates;\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nLimited access to capital to invest in infrastructure, hire and train employees; and\n\u2022\nUncertainties related to product acceptance.\nIn addition, we have entered into long-term and evergreen agreements with several of our international licensees. The extended term of these agreements could affect our ability to negotiate changes or amendments to our relationships with these licensees should market conditions so warrant or business concerns arise. Furthermore, some of our international licensees represent our interests in several international jurisdictions. Difficulties or disputes with our licensees concerning a particular international jurisdiction could impact our ability to do business successfully in other jurisdictions in which those licensees represent our interests.\nAny of these factors could harm the operations of our licensees and, consequently, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to re-enter the Brazilian market in a timely manner or on favorable terms.\nIn January 2015, as part of a legal settlement with Tracker do Brasil LTDA (\u201cTracker\u201d), we terminated Tracker as our exclusive licensee in the country of Brazil. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are continuing to work on a plan for re-entering the Brazilian market. We may face challenges in identifying suitable licensees for our technology in Brazil or otherwise in re-entering the Brazilian market due to legal and regulatory requirements, the development of required hardware or infrastructure, competition from established providers of stolen vehicle recovery products in Brazil, and/or continued acceptance of our products and services. No assurances can be given that we will be able to re-enter the Brazilian market in a timely manner or on terms favorable to us, or that we will be able to realize the expected benefits of terminating our relationship with Tracker in Brazil.\nIf we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impeded and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, but we may not be able to adequately protect our technology from misappropriation or infringement. We cannot ensure that our existing intellectual property rights will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or rendered unenforceable. In addition, the laws of some countries in which we offer or plan to offer our products through our international licensees may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and/or Canada, increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation can be time consuming and expensive, with outcomes often difficult to predict. Our failure to successfully protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a court determines that our technology infringes on third parties\u2019 intellectual property, we will likely face significant costs and we may lose our rights to the technology, which would harm our business.\nWe may inadvertently violate the intellectual property rights of other parties and those third parties may choose to assert infringement claims against us. If we are unsuccessful in any litigation based on a claim of infringement, in addition to exposure to substantial monetary damages, we could be required to expend considerable resources to modify our products, to develop non-infringing technology or to obtain licenses to permit our continued use of the technology that is the subject matter of the litigation. If we are unsuccessful in these endeavors, we may be enjoined from using the technology subject to the infringement claim which could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps significantly.\nOur failure to successfully integrate businesses that we may acquire could disrupt our business and negatively impact our future financial condition and operating results.\nWe may make strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, and such acquisitions could disrupt our business, divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business objectives or involve unforeseen difficulties and costs. We may not be able to successfully integrate the business, technology or personnel that we have acquired or those we might acquire in the future in a timely manner, or at all, and this could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any of these risks could negatively impact our ability to fully realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions. Moreover, we may be unable to find attractive acquisition opportunities or may lose these opportunities to competitors, some of whom may have greater resources than we do.\nExpansion of our presence in the telematics business could subject us to increased costs and risks and may not achieve the intended results.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in our telematics business. There can be no assurance that these investments will be successful or profitable and will not negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The continuing focus on our business activities in the areas of telematics for fleet management and the tracking of commercial equipment could subject us to various risks that differ from the ones we have faced in the past, including:\n\u2022\nDistraction of management and other personnel from our stolen vehicle recovery business;\n\u2022\nInexperience in the telematics market and with a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model;\n\u2022\nCompetitive challenges in the telematics market, which is highly fragmented and rapidly changing and has low barriers to entry;\n\u2022\nFailure of small and medium-sized businesses, commercial fleets, automotive dealerships and/or law enforcement agencies to adopt fleet management solutions;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in selling fleet management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, which generally have limited budgets and are price sensitive and difficult to reach with targeted sales campaigns;\n\u2022\nChallenges in retaining customers, including as a result of high failure rates among small and medium-sized businesses and ease in switching among solutions;\n\u2022\nFailure of original equipment manufacturers, rental firms, construction contractors and similar users of commercial equipment to adopt telematics solutions;\n\u2022\nInability to meet minimum service level commitments to customers;\n\u2022\nFailure to attract and retain highly qualified sales personnel for these products and services;\n\u2022\nDisruption, failure or increase in the costs associated with the use of GPS networks;\n\u2022\nFailure of the solutions we offer to keep pace with technological developments and other changes in the telematics industry; and\n\u2022\nEvolving regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to data privacy that may apply to the collection, management or storage of data.\nIf we do not successfully manage our strategic alliance with TomTom and other strategic relationships, we may not realize the expected benefits from such relationships and we may experience delays in product development.\nIn 2013, we entered into a strategic alliance with TomTom, through which we offer fleet telematics solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, commercial fleets, automotive dealerships and law enforcement agencies. In 2014, we entered into a strategic alliance with Trackunit A/S with respect to tracking solutions for commercial equipment. There can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or other strategic relationships that we may enter into in the future. Management of such relationships may adversely affect or disrupt our core business, decrease our profitability, cause us to incur significant expenses, or divert management resources that otherwise would be available for other initiatives. In addition, parties to such arrangements may fail to fully perform their obligations or meet our expectations or cooperate with us satisfactorily for various reasons, and there may be conflicts or other collaboration failures and inefficiencies between us and the other parties. If we encounter difficulties in integrating the other party\u2019s technology with our technology or these relationships otherwise fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.\nMoreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our relationships with TomTom or to develop additional strategic relationships with other parties. In particular, our agreement with TomTom has an initial term of 36 months, and either party may terminate the agreement for breach or if the other party ceases to carry on its business or similar events. TomTom also may terminate the agreement if a competitor of TomTom acquires greater than fifty percent of our capital stock or we fail to meet certain minimum sales levels. We have not met these minimum sales requirements and, as a result, TomTom has the right to terminate the agreement, although, as of the date of this report, TomTom has not elected to do so. If this agreement were to be terminated, we would lose our right to offer fleet management solutions utilizing TomTom\u2019s technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations.\nIn addition, Trackunit has elected to terminate its agreement with us in accordance with its terms, effective August 3, 2016. While we believe that there are other providers of fleet management systems with whom we may partner following such termination in order to continue to provide the LoJack Connect product, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in a timely manner or on favorable terms.\nA failure of our information systems or any security breach or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent upon the efficient operation of our information systems. In particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage our pricing strategy and tools, sales, inventory, and installation efforts, the preparation of our consolidated financial and operating data, and customer information. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain and enhance or protect the integrity of these systems could disrupt our business operations, impact sales and results of operations, expose us to customer or third-party claims, or result in adverse publicity. We also recently upgraded our ERP system, and any problems associated with the further implementation of this platform could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of our business. Despite the security measures we have in place and any additional measures we may implement in the future, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, human errors, acts of vandalism, or other events. Any security breach or event resulting in the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our business, or otherwise affect our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThere are risks inherent in owning our common stock.\nThe market price and volume of our common stock have been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These may arise from the pending transaction with CalAmp, general stock market conditions, the impact of the risk factors described above on our business, financial condition and results of operations, a change in sentiment in the market regarding us or our business prospects, the general lack of liquidity in the trading market for our common stock, or from other factors.\nSizeable future sales of our common stock may depress the share price for our common stock or prevent or delay our ability to sell equity investments in our Company at competitive rates.\nIf we or our shareholders sell sizeable amounts of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of options, or if the perception exists that we or our shareholders may sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may fall. In addition, any substantial sales of these securities in the public market might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and in a place we deem appropriate or necessary for our business objectives.\nThe foregoing risk factors may be considered forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revision to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.", "PERMNO": 89659, "SIC": 3669, "TIC": "LOJN"}
