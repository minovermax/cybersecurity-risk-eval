Certain Risk Factors that may affect Growth and Profitability.\nThe following factors may affect the growth and profitability of Milestone Scientific and should be considered by any prospective purchaser or current holder of Milestone Scientific\u2019s securities:\nMilestone Scientific does not have a consistent history of profitable operations. Continuing losses could exhaust capital resources and force Milestone Scientific to discontinue operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, revenues were approximately $9.4 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Milestone Scientific has a net loss of approximately $5.4 million for year ended December 31, 2015 and a net loss of approximately $1.7 million for year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, Milestone Scientific has had losses for each year since the commencement of operations with the exception of 2013. Milestone Scientific has an accumulated deficit of approximately $78.6 million. At December 31, 2015, Milestone Scientific had cash and cash equivalents approximately $4.2 million, and working capital of approximately $8.2 million. The working capital in 2015 decreased by\napproximately $4.9 million from December 31, 2014. The change in working capital is primarily due to the use of cash for operations and the consolidation of Milestone Medical liabilities. As of December 31, 2015 Milestone Scientific believes that with the new Dental Distributor Agreement with Henry Schein Inc. (effective January 1, 2016), the world\u2019s largest supplier of medical, dental and veterinary supplies and devices, that dental revenues are projected to improve in the upcoming 12 months. To further reduce our expenditures, Milestone Medical expenses related to USA FDA clearance for the epidural and intra-articular instruments can be controlled as required to meet our budget. By limiting the FDA related expenses and increasing the dental instrument revenue through the new distribution agreement, management believes that Milestone Scientific will have sufficient cash reserves to meet all of its anticipated obligations over the next twelve months.\nMilestone Scientific management continues to examine all areas of the business to manage our cash flow. Milestone Scientific is actively pursuing the generation of positive cash flows from operating activities through an increase in revenue based upon management\u2019s assessment of present contracts and current negotiations and reductions in operating expenses.\nWe cannot become successful unless we gain greater market acceptance for our products and technology.\nAs with any new technology, there is substantial risk that the marketplace will not accept the potential benefits of this technology or be unwilling to pay for any cost differential with the existing technologies. Market acceptance of CompuDent\u00ae, STA Instrument, The Safety Wand\u00ae, CompuMed\u00ae and CompuFlo\u00ae depends, in large part, upon the ability to educate potential customers of the product\u2019s distinctive characteristics and benefits and will require substantial marketing efforts and expense. More than 43,000 instruments of the STA Instrument and its predecessors have been sold worldwide since 1998. Since being introduced to market in February 2007, more than 15,000 of the STA Instrument have been sold. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that its current or proposed products will be accepted by practitioners or that any of the current or proposed products will be able to compete effectively against current and alternative products.\nOur limited distribution channels must be expanded in order to become successful.\nFuture revenues depend on Milestone Scientific\u2019s ability to market and distribute its computer-controlled injection products successfully. In November 2012, Milestone Scientific signed on an exclusive distributor and marketing company to sell and distribute the STA instruments and handpieces in the USA and Canada. This exclusive agreement was modified to a non-exclusive agreement in December 31, 2015 and will expire on March 31, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2016, Henry Schein, the leading distributor of dental products in the USA and Canada, will have a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Milestone Scientific. To be successful, Milestone Scientific will need to engage additional distributors, provide for their proper training and ensure adequate customer support. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that it will be able to hire and retain an adequate sales force or engage suitable distributors, or that the sales force or distributors will be able to successfully market and sell the products.\nWe depend on two principal manufacturers. If Milestone Scientific cannot maintain its existing relationships or develop new ones, it may have to cease operations.\nMilestone Scientific and its subsidiary has informal arrangements with the manufacturer of the STA Instrument, CompuDent\u00ae and CompuMed\u00ae instruments and with one of the principal manufacturers of the handpieces, for those items, respectively. Pursuant to the informal arrangements, they manufacture these products under specific purchase orders without minimum purchase commitment. However, in November 2009, Milestone Scientific issued a purchase order to Tricor System Inc. to manufacture 12,000 STA Instruments, over the following three years. Milestone Scientific has a manufacturing agreement with one of the principal manufacturers, which is a related party, of its handpieces pursuant to which they manufacture products under specific purchase orders but without minimum purchase commitments. Milestone Scientific has been supplied by the manufacturer of the STA Instrument, CompuDent\u00ae and CompuMed\u00ae since the commencement of production in 1998, the manufacturer of its handpieces since 2003. However, termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these manufacturers could significantly and adversely affect the ability to produce and sell the products. Though other alternate sources of supply for handpieces exist, Milestone Scientific would need to recover its existing tools or have new tools produced to establish relationships with new suppliers. Establishing new manufacturing relationships could involve significant expense and delay. Any curtailment or interruptions of the supply, whether or not as a result or termination of the relationship, would have an adverse effect.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims that are not fully covered by insurance and that could put Milestone Scientific under financial strain.\nMilestone Scientific could be subject to claims for personal injury from the alleged malfunction or misuse of the dental and medical products. While Milestone Scientific carries liability insurance that is believed to be adequate, Milestone Scientific cannot assure that the insurance coverage will be sufficient to pay such claims should they be successful. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on Milestone Scientific.\nMilestone Scientific relies on the continuing services of the Chief Executive Officer and Director of Clinical Affairs.\nMilestone Scientific depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Clinical Affairs. Milestone Scientific maintains a key man life insurance policy in the amount of $1,000,000 on the life of the Chief Executive Officer. However, the loss of his services or Director of Clinical Affairs, on whom Milestone Scientific maintains no insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on the business.\nThe market price of Milestone Scientific\u2019s common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of various factors, some of which are beyond Milestone Scientific\u2019s control.\nMilestone Scientific\u2019s stock price has been extremely volatile, fluctuating during the last two years between $4.00 and $1.17. The market price of common shares could continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, some of which may be beyond Milestone Scientific\u2019s control.\nMilestone Scientific is controlled by a limited number of shareholders.\nMilestone Scientific\u2019s principal shareholders, Leonard Osser, Gian Domenico Trombetta, K. Tucker Andersen, and Robert Gintel beneficially own approximately 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, they have the ability to exercise substantial control over Milestone Scientific\u2019s affairs and corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including electing directors, selling all or substantially all of the assets, merging with another entity or amending its certificate of incorporation. This de facto control could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for Milestone Scientific\u2019s securities.\nFuture sales or the potential for sale of a substantial number of shares of Milestone Scientific\u2019s common stock could cause the trading price of common stock to decline and could impair Milestone Scientific\u2019s ability to raise capital through subsequent equity offerings.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Milestone Scientific\u2019s common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of the stock to decline and could materially impair its ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. At December 31, 2015, Milestone Scientific had outstanding options to purchase 1,427,769 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $0.36 to $3.89 per share with a weighted average exercise price of $1.56. Holders of these options are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock and are likely to exercise their securities at a time when Milestone Scientific would be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms. Thus, the terms upon which Milestone Scientific will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected, since the holders of outstanding options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when Milestone Scientific would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than the exercise terms provided by such outstanding securities. The market price of the common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of various factors, some of which are beyond Milestone Scientific\u2019s control.\nAdherence to Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be so costly that compliance could have an adverse effect on Milestone Scientific.\nThe Management of Milestone Scientific has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Milestone Scientific complied with Sarbanes-Oxley requirements to include in the annual report a management report on\nthe effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. In 2005, Milestone Scientific hired an outside consultant to assist with the development and implementation of the necessary internal controls and reporting procedures. In 2015 and 2014, Milestone Scientific utilized the outside consultant on a quarterly basis to review compliance with the internal controls over financial reporting. This expense amounted to approximately $10,000 and $5,000 in 2015 and 2014, respectively and the cost is expected to continue in 2016.", "PERMNO": 82621, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "MLSS"}
