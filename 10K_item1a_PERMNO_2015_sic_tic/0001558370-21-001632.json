RISK FACTORS\nOur business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. The following are factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties. See the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nThe spread of COVID-19, is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, demand for our products and our financial results.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread to over 100 countries, including every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the U.S. declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with COVID-19. We continue to monitor the health of the employees in each of our 46 manufacturing facilities, domestically and outside the U.S., as COVID-19 related illness at a particular location could impact continued manufacturing operations at that location.\nForeign governmental organizations and governmental organizations at the national, state and local levels in the U.S. have taken various actions to combat the spread of COVID-19, including imposing stay-at-home orders that effectively close \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses and their operations. Because we manufacture food ingredients, our operations are currently considered \u201cessential\u201d under most current COVID-19 government regulations, thus permitting us to continue operations at our facilities and sales activities consistent with those regulations.\nCertain of our customers, however, are deemed to be \u201cnon-essential\u201d industries and businesses under governmental regulations. The industries and businesses deemed \u201cnon-essential\u201d vary by country and region. For example, Mexico declared one or more brewing producers as \u201cnon-essential\u201d industries for a period of time during the pandemic. Our customers in affected industries are not able to produce goods during the government-mandated closures, which adversely affects customer demand for our products. Further, government-enacted stay-at-home orders have significantly limited the end-consumers\u2019 ability in the U.S. and foreign markets to purchase certain food or beverage products due to limitations on the operations of restaurants, bars and regionally specific sales channels. We expect that these limitations over time will continue to negatively affect customer demand for our products, further impacting our revenues and our operating results. Further, any inability by our customers to produce goods may delay our customers\u2019 ability to pay outstanding receivables, which would adversely impact our cash flow from operations and working capital.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively affecting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Such risks include, in addition to those described above, negative impacts on our cost of and access to capital, pressure to extend our customers\u2019 payment terms, insolvency of our customers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses, and counterparty failures in our supply chain, customer network or otherwise that would negatively impact our operations. These risks individually and in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.\nChanges in consumer preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability and harm our business.\nFood products are often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends. For instance, changes in prevailing health or dietary preferences causing consumers to avoid food products containing sweetener products, including high fructose corn syrup, in favor of foods that are perceived as being more healthy, could materially reduce our sales and profitability. Increasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the potential health concerns associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles (reflected, for instance, in taxes designed to combat obesity, which have been imposed recently in North America) represent a significant challenge to some of our customers, including those engaged in the food and soft drink industries, and could materially affect demand for our products.\nCurrent economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with whom we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions in South America, the European Union, and many other countries and regions in which we do business have experienced various levels of weakness over the last few years and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. General business and economic conditions that could affect us include barriers to trade (including as a result of tariffs, duties, and border taxes, among other factors), the strength of the economies in which we operate, unemployment, inflation, and fluctuations in debt markets. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in the financial markets.\nThere could be a number of other effects from these economic developments on our business, including reduced consumer demand for products, pressure to extend our customers\u2019 payment terms, insolvency of our customers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses, decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations, and counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations.\nIn connection with our defined benefit pension plans, adverse changes in investment returns earned on pension assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities or changes in required pension funding levels may have an unfavorable impact on future pension expenses and cash flows.\nIn addition, volatile worldwide economic conditions and market instability may make it difficult for us, our customers, and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to produce excess products that could increase our inventory carrying costs. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products.\nOur reliance on certain industries for a significant portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nApproximately 54 percent of our 2020 net sales were made to companies engaged in the food industry and approximately 10 percent of our 2020 net sales were made to companies in the beverage industry. Additionally, sales to the animal nutrition and brewing industry represented approximately 10 percent and approximately 7 percent, respectively, of our 2020 net sales, while 19 percent of our 2020 net sales were made to companies engaged in other industries. If our food customers, beverage customers, animal feed customers, or brewing industry customers were to substantially decrease their purchases, our business might be materially adversely affected.\nThe uncertainty of acceptance of products developed through biotechnology could affect our profitability.\nThe commercial success of agricultural products developed through biotechnology, including genetically modified corn, depends in part on public acceptance of their development, cultivation, distribution and consumption. Public attitudes can be influenced by claims that genetically modified products are unsafe for consumption or that they pose unknown risks to the environment, even if such claims are not based on scientific studies. These public attitudes can influence regulatory and legislative decisions about biotechnology. The sale of our products, which may contain genetically modified corn, could be delayed or impeded because of adverse public perception regarding the safety of our products and the potential effects of these products on human health, the environment, and animals.\nOur future growth could be negatively impacted if we fail to continue introducing innovative new products and services.\nA significant portion of our growth depends on innovation in products, processes, and services. Our research and development efforts may not result in new products and services at a rate or of a quality sufficient to gain market acceptance.\nIt may be difficult to preserve operating margins and maintain market share in the highly competitive environment in which we operate.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition in markets in which we compete is largely based on price, quality, and product availability. Many of our products compete with virtually identical or similar products manufactured by other companies in the starch and sweetener industry. In the U.S., our competitors include divisions of larger enterprises that have greater financial resources than we do. Some of these competitors, unlike us, have vertically integrated their corn refining and other operations. Many of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn, including cane and beet sugar. Fluctuation in prices of these competing products may affect prices of, and profits derived from, our products. In addition, government programs supporting sugar prices indirectly impact the price of corn sweeteners, especially high fructose corn syrup. Furthermore, co-products such as corn oil and gluten meal compete with products of the corn dry milling industry and with soybean oil, soybean meal, and other products, the price of some of which may be affected by government programs such as tariffs or quotas.\nDue to market volatility, we may be unable to pass potential increases in the cost of corn and other raw materials on to customers through product price increases, or to purchase quantities of corn and other raw materials at prices sufficient to sustain or increase our profitability.\nThe price and availability of corn and other raw materials are subject to volatility as a result of economic and industry conditions, including supply and demand factors such as crop disease and severe weather conditions that include drought, floods, or frost. These conditions are difficult to anticipate, are beyond our control, and could adversely impact our profitability by affecting the prices we pay for raw materials.\nRaw material and energy price fluctuations, and supply interruptions and shortages could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur finished products are made primarily from corn. Purchased corn and other raw material costs account for between 40 percent and 65 percent of finished product costs. Some of our products are based upon specific varieties of corn that are produced in significantly less volumes than yellow dent corn. These specialty grains are higher-cost due to their more limited supply and require planning cycles of up to three years in order for us to receive our desired amounts of specialty corn. We also manufacture certain starch-based products from potatoes. Our current potato starch requirements constitute a material portion of the total available North American supply. It is possible that, in the long term, continued growth in demand for potato starch-based ingredients and new product development could result in capacity constraints. Also, we utilize tapioca in the manufacturing of starch products primarily in Thailand, as well as pulses, gum, rice, plant-based stevia, and other raw materials around the world. A significant supply disruption or sharp increase in any of these raw material prices that we are unable to recover through pricing increases to our customers could have an adverse impact on our growth and profitability.\nEnergy costs represent approximately 9 percent of our finished product costs. We use energy primarily to create steam required for our production processes and to dry products. We consume coal, natural gas, electricity, wood, and fuel oil to generate energy.\nThe market prices for our raw materials may vary considerably depending on supply and demand, world economies, trade agreements and tariffs, and other factors. We purchase these commodities based on our anticipated usage and future outlook for these costs. We may not be able to purchase these commodities at prices that we can adequately pass on to customers to sustain or increase profitability.\nIn North America, we sell a large portion of our finished products derived from corn at firm prices established in supply contracts typically lasting for periods of up to one year. In order to minimize the effect of volatility in the cost of corn related to these firm-priced supply contracts, we enter into corn futures and options contracts, or take other hedging positions in the corn futures market. These derivative contracts typically mature within one year. At expiration, we settle the derivative contracts at a net amount equal to the difference between the then-current price of the commodity and the derivative contract price. The fluctuations in the fair value of these hedging instruments may adversely affect our cash flow. We fund any unrealized losses or receive cash for any unrealized gains on futures contracts on a daily basis. While the corn futures contracts or hedging positions are intended to minimize the effect of volatility of corn costs on operating profits, the hedging activity can result in losses, some of which may be material.\nAn inability to contain costs could adversely affect our future profitability and growth.\nOur future profitability and growth depends on our ability to contain operating costs and per unit product costs and to maintain and implement effective cost control programs, while at the same time maintaining competitive pricing and superior quality products, customer service, and support. Our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure depends on continued containment of manufacturing, delivery, freight, and administrative costs, as well as the implementation of cost-effective purchasing programs for raw materials, energy, and related manufacturing requirements.\nIf we are unable to contain our operating costs and maintain the productivity and reliability of our production facilities, our profitability and growth could be adversely affected.\nClimate change and future costs of environmental compliance may be material.\nOur business could be affected in the future by national and global regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the potential effects of climate change. Changes in precipitation extremes, droughts and water availability have the potential to impact Ingredion's agricultural supply as well as the availability of water for our manufacturing operations. Globally, a number of countries have instituted or are considering climate change legislation and regulations. Ingredion continues to assess the impact of climate change, regulatory pressures and changing consumer behaviors on our business strategy. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation, and raw materials costs, and we may be required to make additional investments in our facilities and equipment.\nWe may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such transactions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and require significant management resources.\nWe regularly review potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services, or products, as well as potential strategic alliances. We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form partnerships or strategic alliances. Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete such acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service, or product into our existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may require significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance, and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial\nresults. Future acquisitions could also require us to issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities, or amortize expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could harm our business.\nOperating difficulties at our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our operating results.\nProducing starches and sweeteners through corn refining is a capital intensive industry. We conduct preventive maintenance and de-bottlenecking programs at our 46 manufacturing facilities designed to maintain and improve grind capacity and facility reliability. If we encounter operating difficulties at a facility for an extended period of time or start-up problems with any capital improvement projects, we may not be able to meet a portion of sales order commitments and could incur significantly higher operating expenses, both of which could adversely affect our operating results. We also use boilers to generate steam required in our production processes. An event that impaired the operation of a boiler for an extended period of time could have a significant adverse effect on the operations of any manufacturing facility in which such event occurred.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks related to such matters as product safety and quality; compliance with environmental, health and safety and food safety regulations; and customer product liability claims. The liabilities that could result from these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed the limits of, our insurance coverage related to product liability and food safety matters. In addition, negative publicity caused by product liability and food safety matters may damage our reputation. The occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nWe operate a multinational business subject to the economic, political, and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries and with foreign currencies.\nWe have operated in foreign countries and with foreign currencies for many years. Our results are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our operations are subject to political, economic, and other risks. There has been and continues to be significant political uncertainty in some countries in which we operate. Economic changes, terrorist activity, and political unrest may result in business interruption or decreased demand for our products. Protectionist trade measures and import and export licensing requirements could also adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe primarily sell products derived from world commodities. Historically, we have been able to adjust local prices relatively quickly to offset the effect of local currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar, although we cannot guarantee our ability to do this in the future. For example, due to pricing controls on many consumer products imposed in the recent past by the Argentine government, it currently takes longer than previously to achieve pricing improvement in response to currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar in Argentina. The anticipated strength in the U.S. dollar may continue to involve risks, as it could take us an extended period of time to fully recapture the impact of foreign currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar, particularly in South America.\nWe may hedge transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the currency of the operating unit entering into the underlying transaction. Our hedging activities may not be fully successful in limiting the adverse impacts of our currency risks.\nOur profitability could be negatively impacted if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 31 percent of our U.S. employees and 32 percent of our total Company employees were members of unions. Strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages or slowdowns involving our unionized employees could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations.\nNatural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemics, and other significant events could negatively impact our business.\nThe economies of any countries in which we sell or manufacture products or purchase raw materials could be affected by natural disasters. Such natural disasters could include, among others, earthquakes, floods, or severe weather;\nwar, acts of war, or terrorism; or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic. Any such natural disaster could result in asset write-offs, decreased sales and overall reduced cash flows.\nThe recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or long-lived assets could adversely impact our future financial position and results of operations.\nWe have $1.3 billion of total net intangible assets as of December 31, 2020, consisting of $902 million of goodwill and $444 million of other net intangible assets, which constitute 13 percent and 6 percent, respectively, of our total assets as of such date. Additionally, we have $2.8 billion of long-lived assets, or 41 percent of our total assets, as of December 31, 2020.\nWe perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible assets, and as necessary, for other long-lived assets. If the results of such assessments were to show that the fair value of these assets were less than the carrying values, we could be required to recognize a charge for impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, and the amount of the impairment charge could be material. We continue to monitor our reporting units in struggling economies and recent acquisitions for circumstances affecting these businesses that may negatively impact the fair value of these reporting units.\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment of $35 million related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the TIC Gums tradename. During the first quarter of 2021, we will record an impairment affecting South American net assets contributed to a joint venture. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate that would require a change in our assumptions or strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions, could require us to perform an assessment prior to the next required assessment date of July 1, 2021.\nOur profitability may be affected by other factors beyond our control.\nOur operating income and ability to increase profitability depend to a large extent upon our ability to price finished products at a level that will cover manufacturing and raw material costs and provide an acceptable profit margin. Our ability to maintain appropriate price levels is determined by a number of factors largely beyond our control, such as aggregate industry supply and market demand, which may vary from time to time, and the economic conditions of the geographic regions in which we conduct our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Compliance\nGovernment policies and regulations could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies, and similar organizations. These conditions include, among others, changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic or political conditions, modification or termination of trade agreements or treaties promoting free trade, creation of new trade agreements or treaties, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange rate fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit our ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by actions taken in connection with cross-border disputes by the governments of countries in which we conduct business.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, changes in tax laws, or tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d), which was enacted in December 2017, significantly altered existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous and complex provisions that substantially affect our business. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service continue to interpret and issue guidance on provisions of the TCJA that could differ from the way in which we interpret some of the provisions. Consequently, we may make adjustments to our provision for income taxes based on differences in interpretation in the periods in which guidance is issued.\nSignificant changes in the tax laws of the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we do business could result from the base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). An OECD-led coalition of 44 countries is contemplating changes to long-standing international tax norms that determine each country\u2019s right to tax cross-border transactions. These contemplated changes, as adopted by countries in which we do business, could increase tax uncertainty and the risk of double taxation, thereby adversely affecting our provision for income taxes.\nThe recoverability of our deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Financing Activities\nIncreased interest rates could increase our borrowing costs.\nWe may continue to issue debt securities to finance acquisitions, capital expenditures, and working capital, or for other general corporate purposes. An increase in interest rates in the general economy could result in an increase in our borrowing costs for these financings, as well as under our credit facility debt that bears interest at an unhedged floating rate.\nWe may not have access to the funds required for future growth and expansion.\nWe may not have access to additional funds we need to grow and expand our operations. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from operating cash flow to the extent we are able to do so. If our operating cash flow is insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, we may either reduce our capital expenditures or utilize borrowings under our credit facilities. For further strategic growth through mergers or acquisitions, we may also seek to generate additional liquidity through the sale of debt or equity securities in private or public markets or through the sale of assets. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures or that we will be able to obtain additional funds from financial markets or from the sale of assets at terms favorable to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient additional funds to cover our capital expenditures or other strategic growth opportunities, we may not be able to achieve our desired operating efficiencies and expansion plans, which may adversely impact our competitiveness and, therefore, our results of operations. Our working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of corn and other agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology Systems\nOur information technology systems, processes, and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches, or failures which may affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur operations rely on certain key information technology systems, which are dependent on services provided by third parties, and provide critical data connectivity, information, and services for internal and external users. These interactions include, among others, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, risk management activities, converting raw materials to finished products, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage our business. Increased information technology security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose potential risks to the security of our information technology systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our third-party and employee data. We have put in place security measures to protect ourselves against cyber-based attacks and disaster recovery plans for our critical systems. However, if our information technology systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and if our disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, we may encounter significant disruptions that could interrupt our ability to manage our operations, cause loss of valuable data and actual or threatened legal actions, and cause us to suffer damage to our reputation, all of which may adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and financial condition. We reported a malware incident that occurred from October 2019 to December 2019, although this incident did not have a material impact on our business.\nThe costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing or other critical functions. Breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other third parties could expose us, our customers or other affected third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory enforcement, litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We rely in certain limited capacities on third-party data management providers and other vendors whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us.\nRisks Related to Investment in Our Common Stock\nVolatility in the stock market, fluctuations in quarterly operating results, and other factors could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as our announcement of new products or services or such announcements by our competitors; technological innovation by us, our competitors or other vendors; quarterly variations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors; general conditions in our or our customers\u2019 markets; and changes in earnings estimates by analysts or reported results that vary materially from such estimates. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies that have been unrelated to the operating performance of any individual company.\nNo assurance can be given that we will continue to pay dividends, or as to the amount of any dividend we pay.\nThe payment of dividends, as well as the amount of any dividends, is solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Future dividend payments, if any, also will be subject to our financial results and the availability of statutory surplus funds to pay dividends. These factors could result in a change to our current policy of paying dividends.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to ineffective information technology general controls which, if not remediated appropriately or timely, could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.\nInternal controls related to the operation of information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, management identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access over certain IT systems that support the Company\u2019s financial reporting processes. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. We seek to remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal 2021, but may not succeed in doing so. Remedial measures may require us to invest in additional technology and other expenses. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.", "PERMNO": 85645, "SIC": 2040, "TIC": "INGR"}
