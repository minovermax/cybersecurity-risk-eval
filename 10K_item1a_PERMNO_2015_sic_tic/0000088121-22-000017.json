{"cik": "88121", "company": "SEABOARD CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n(1) International Operations May Present Certain Risks. Seaboard\u2019s international activities, some of which are in lesser-developed countries, pose risks not faced by companies that limit themselves to U.S. markets. These risks include:\n\u25cf changes in foreign currency exchange rates, currency inconvertibility and devaluation;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange or retail price controls;\n\u25cf hyperinflation;\n\u25cf heightened customer credit and execution risk;\n\u25cf border restrictions, tariffs, bilateral trade disputes, quotas, trade barriers, import or export licensing requirements and other trade protection measures;\n\u25cf closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of products or other limitations on Seaboard\u2019s ability to access materials or ports, including due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;\n\u25cf changes in tax laws;\n\u25cf legal and regulatory structures and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and any lawsuits that may arise;\n\u25cf negative perception within a foreign country of a U.S. company doing business in that foreign country;\n\u25cf compliance with laws and regulations for conducting international business such as Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations;\n\u25cf government instability, expropriation, confiscation, war, civil unrest, and corruption; and\n\u25cf enforcement and compliance of local laws and remedies in foreign jurisdictions, including inconsistent application or enforcement, including tax laws.\nAccordingly, revenues, operating income and cash flows from international operations could fluctuate significantly from year to year. In addition, border restrictions and foreign government policies and regulations could restrict the purchase of various commodities, reducing Seaboard\u2019s ability to access materials or ports, or limiting sales prices for products sold in local markets.\n(2) Deterioration of Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect the Business. Seaboard\u2019s business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates (including the LIBOR phase-out in June 2023), availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, supply chain and labor market disruptions, impacts caused by highly pathogenic disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for and production of Seaboard\u2019s meat products, grains, shipping services and other products, or the cost and availability of needed raw materials and packaging materials, or workforce availability, thereby negatively affecting Seaboard\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Seaboard is monitoring the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants, which has caused significant disruption to global financial markets, supply chains and labor markets. The significance of the operational and financial impact of COVID-19 and related variants to Seaboard will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The national and global economic conditions, could, among other things:\n\u25cf impair the financial condition of some of Seaboard\u2019s customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by customers and suppliers;\n\u25cf negatively impact global demand for protein and grain-based products, which could result in a reduction of revenues, operating income and cash flows;\n\u25cf decrease the value of Seaboard\u2019s investments in equity and debt securities, including short-term investments used for liquidity and pension plan assets, causing losses that would adversely impact Seaboard\u2019s net earnings; and\n\u25cf impair the financial viability of Seaboard\u2019s insurers.\n(3) Seaboard\u2019s Common Stock Is Thinly Traded and Subject to Daily Price Fluctuations. The common stock of Seaboard is closely held and thinly traded on a daily basis on the NYSE American. Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC, which are beneficially owned by the Bresky family, hold approximately 77% of Seaboard\u2019s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the price of a share of Seaboard common stock could fluctuate more significantly from day-to-day than that of a share of more widely held stock that is actively traded on a daily basis.\n(4) Decentralization May Present Certain Risks. Seaboard\u2019s operations are relatively decentralized in comparison with its peers. While Seaboard executive management believes this practice enables it to remain responsive to risks, opportunities and to customers\u2019 needs, it necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of local management. This presents various risks, including the risk that executive management may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business than in a more centralized environment. In addition, it means that Seaboard may be slower to detect compliance related problems (e.g., a rogue employee undertaking activities that are prohibited by applicable law or Seaboard\u2019s internal policies) and that \u201ccompany-wide\u201d business initiatives, such as the integration of disparate information technology systems, are often more challenging and costly to implement, and their risk of failure higher, than they would be in a more centralized environment. Depending on the nature of the problem or initiative in question, such failure could materially adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n(5) Investments in Non-Consolidated Affiliates May Present Certain Risks. Seaboard has several equity method investments in which it owns 50% or less, with various third-party business partners owning the remaining equity. Due to the ownership structure of these affiliates, Seaboard participates in board of director\u2019s or comparable governing body\u2019s decisions, but does not control the decision-making processes and could be exposed to various business risks if the business partners\u2019 business decisions do not align with Seaboard\u2019s best interests, which could adversely impact the results for Seaboard\u2019s income (loss) from affiliates.\n(6) Cyber-Attacks or Cybersecurity Breaches Could Adversely Affect the Business. Seaboard may be adversely impacted if it is unable to protect its information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks or cybersecurity breaches. Seaboard may also be adversely impacted if third parties on whom Seaboard relies are unable to similarly protect their information technology systems. Attempted cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Any significant penetration, invasion, destruction, or interruption of these systems could negatively impact operations and there is a risk of business interruption and reputational damage from the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and a risk of loss to financial assets related to manipulated electronic communications. This includes additional costs for increased security, system remediation and breach detection. If Seaboard is unable to prevent such breaches or failures or if a third party on whom Seaboard relies is unable to prevent such breaches or failures, Seaboard\u2019s operations could be disrupted or it could negatively impact Seaboard\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and the market price of its common stock.\nIndustry Risks\n(1) The Food Industry May Present Certain Risks. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:\n\u25cf food spoilage;\n\u25cf food contamination, including contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, E coli and aflatoxin;\n\u25cf food allergens;\n\u25cf adverse weather;\n\u25cf evolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns;\n\u25cf international, federal, state and local food processing regulations;\n\u25cf consumer product liability claims;\n\u25cf product recall;\n\u25cf product tampering; and\n\u25cf public perception of food production practices, including handling of production and live animals.\nPathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and therefore may be present in Seaboard\u2019s products. These pathogens also can be introduced to Seaboard\u2019s products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. Seaboard does not have control over handling procedures once products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, Seaboard\u2019s brand reputation could be harmed, revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and Seaboard\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\n(2) Fluctuations in Commodity Prices May Present Certain Risks. Sales prices for many of Seaboard\u2019s products are directly affected by both domestic and worldwide supply and demand for commodities for products which it sells and competing products, all of which are determined by constantly changing market forces, as well as other factors, over which Seaboard has little to no control.\n\u25cf In the Pork and Turkey segments, commodity pork prices demonstrate a cyclical nature over periods of years, reflecting changes in the supply of fresh meat and competing proteins on the market.\n\u25cf In the CT&M segment, fluctuating worldwide prices for wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal and, to a lesser degree, various other agricultural commodity products could also be caused by European flour exports, donated food aid, flour dumping practices and worldwide and local crop production.\nThese fluctuating market conditions could have a significant impact on Seaboard\u2019s sales, value of commodities held in inventory and operating income.\n(3) Difficulties Obtaining and Retaining Appropriate Personnel. Seaboard is dependent on having a sufficient number of properly trained operations personnel.\n\u25cf In the Pork and Turkey segments, the nature of the work and remote locations at some processing plants and production operations, along with restrictive national policy on immigration, have affected and could continue to negatively affect the availability and cost of labor.\n\u25cf In the CT&M segment, the loss of a key employee such as a commodity trader could have a negative impact resulting from the loss of revenues as personal customer relationships can be vital to obtaining and retaining business with various foreign customers. Also, employing and retaining qualified expatriate personnel at the mills and other operating facilities are key elements to success given the difficult living conditions, the unique operating environments and the reliance on a relatively small number of executives to manage individual locations.\nThe geographic areas in which Seaboard operates have also experienced labor shortages resulting in higher labor costs. The inability to acquire and retain the services of such personnel, or increased costs associated with the acquisition and retention of such personnel, could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s operations.\n(4) Disruption of Operations at Co-packers or Other Suppliers Could Adversely Affect the Business. Disruption of operations at co-packers or other suppliers may impact Seaboard\u2019s product or raw material supply. Additionally, actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may also adversely affect Seaboard\u2019s financial results.\n(5) Ocean Transportation May Present Certain Risks. Seaboard\u2019s owned and chartered vessels along with related cargoes are at risk of being damaged, lost or incurring excess cost because of events such as:\n\u25cf inclement weather;\n\u25cf mechanical failures;\n\u25cf grounding, fire, explosions and collisions;\n\u25cf human error;\n\u25cf war, piracy and terrorism; and\n\u25cf port access and congestion.\nAny of these hazards could result in death or injury to persons, loss of property, environmental damages, delays or rerouting. If one of Seaboard\u2019s vessels were involved in an incident, the resulting negative public perception could have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, many aspects of the shipping industry are subject to extensive governmental regulations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes, while the failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, the suspension or termination of Seaboard\u2019s operations or detention of its vessels.\n(6) Fluctuations in Fuel Costs Could Adversely Affect the Business. Fuel expenses are a large expense for the Marine segment and also impact the CT&M segment\u2019s results. Fuel prices can vary greatly from year to year. While such fluctuations may be offset through fuel surcharges or other mechanisms, such mechanisms do not act with precision in terms of timing and amount and may not adjust revenues enough to offset the increase in costs.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n(1) Operations Are Subject to General Risks of Litigation. Seaboard is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or injured persons, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, antitrust regulations, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices or environmental matters. Litigation in certain countries carries additional risk due to lack of transparency in judiciaries. Neither litigation trends nor the outcomes of litigation can be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect Seaboard\u2019s financial results.\n(2) Operations Are Subject to Complex Laws and Regulations. Federal, state and local laws, and domestic and international regulations governing worker health and safety, food safety and animal health and welfare, port and terminal security and the operation of vessels, including fuel regulations, significantly affect revenues, costs and the manner or feasibility of doing business. Some requirements applicable to Seaboard may also be enforced by citizen groups.\n\u25cf In the Pork segment, select states have implemented varying standards related to the required living conditions for breeding sows. Some laws apply to animals grown in the state of enactment while, more recently, several states have enacted laws that prohibit the sale of meat from non-compliant animals grown in any of the fifty states or foreign countries. Diversity of standards for housing sows requires each producer to implement separate record keeping to track compliant animals through the growing process to the processing plant, and finished products from the processing plant to third-party purchasers. Such laws can also impose civil and criminal penalties for failing to comply. Animal production assets have long expected useful lives. The enactment of more stringent standards can impair the value of existing assets, increase the cost of production and distribution, lower the value of non-compliant products and/or disrupt the market for pork which could result in a reduction in the sales prices of pork products. Incrementally, strict growing standards could cause the creation of regional markets of compliant products or require the industry to build compliant assets for each market. For example, the state of California enacted the Farm Animal Confinement Initiative (\u201cProposition 12\u201d) which became fully effective January 1, 2022. Proposition 12 prohibits the sale within the state of certain uncooked pork produced from breeding sows or its offspring unless certain conditions are met, which Seaboard currently does not expect to meet until later in 2022. However, the ultimate impact of Proposition 12 to Seaboard is unknown, since the constitutionality of Proposition 12 has been challenged in lawsuits and the California Superior Court has issued a judgment declaring that Proposition 12 is not enforceable until 180 days after final regulations are issued, which has not occurred at the time of this filing. The volume of such pork sold into California accounted for approximately 5% of Seaboard\u2019s direct sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, in addition to indirect sales through further processor customers.\n\u25cf In the Marine segment, many aspects of the shipping industry, including rate agreements and vessel cost sharing agreements, are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission, the U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as regulation by private industry organizations. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes. As an example, this segment may be adversely impacted by changes in vessel fuel consumption efficiency requirements. Certain ships, based on their capacity and other factors, may have to meet certain energy usage standards while sailing. The net effect could be that ships, particularly small ones which are less efficient on a twenty-foot equivalent unit basis, might need to reduce speed to consume less fuel.\n\u25cf In the Sugar and Alcohol segment, Seaboard\u2019s alcohol production facility is affected by Argentine government regulations regarding production quotas, fuel blends and sales prices in the bioethanol market.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations and any future changes to them could result in significant consequences to Seaboard, including civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages, negative publicity and the inability to do business in certain locales. In addition, future changes in laws, regulations and standards may result in additional costs or a reduction in revenues.\n(3) Operations Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulation and Potentially Subject to Environmental Litigation, Proceedings, and Investigations. Seaboard operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, odors, the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or\notherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as any modifications, may be material to Seaboard\u2019s business.\nSpecific Pork Segment Risks\n(1) Increases in Costs of This Segment\u2019s Feed Components and Third-Party Hog Purchases Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising hogs and could be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn and soybean meal. The costs may also be impacted by inflation. The results of this segment could be negatively affected by increased costs of its feed components. Approximately 12% of this segment\u2019s slaughtered hogs were purchased from third parties during 2021, and commodity price fluctuations for hogs could have an impact on this segment\u2019s total costs. The cost and supply of feed components and the third-party hogs that this segment purchases are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand, which are driven by matters over which this segment has no control, including inflation, weather, current and projected worldwide grain stocks and prices, grain export prices, subsidies and tariffs, and governmental agricultural policies. This segment attempts to manage certain of these risks through the use of commodity derivatives; however, this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale pork prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of this segment\u2019s feed components or the cost of third-party hogs purchased would adversely affect this segment\u2019s operating margins.\n(2) The Loss or Closure of This Segment\u2019s Oklahoma Pork Processing Plant or the STF Plant Could Adversely Affect the Business. This segment is largely dependent on the continued operation at full capacity of its Oklahoma pork processing plant and the STF plant. The loss of or damage to either of these plants for any reason, including highly pathogenic disease outbreaks, fire, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action could adversely affect the business of this segment and have a material adverse effect on Seaboard\u2019s liquidity and financial results. This segment provided approximately one-third of STF\u2019s hogs for processing during 2021 and also markets substantially all pork products produced.\n(3) Health Risk to Livestock Could Adversely Affect Production and the Supply of Raw Materials. Seaboard is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases. The general health of the hogs and the reproductive performance of the sows could have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to this segment\u2019s pork processing operations and consumer confidence. If this segment\u2019s hogs are affected by disease, Seaboard could be required to destroy infected livestock, which could adversely affect this segment\u2019s production or ability to sell or export its products. Moreover, the herd health of third-party suppliers could adversely affect the supply and cost of hogs available for purchase. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of this segment\u2019s food products.\n(4) The Operating Profit of the Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel Production Facilities Could Be Adversely Impacted by Various Factors. The profitability of this segment\u2019s biodiesel and renewable diesel plants could be adversely affected by various factors, including the market price of pork fat, other animal fats and vegetable oils, all of which are utilized to produce biodiesel and renewable diesel, and the market price for biodiesel and renewable diesel, which is influenced by inflation, world oil prices and government mandates and incentives to use biofuels. Unfavorable changes in these prices over extended periods of time or adverse changes in government mandates and incentives to use biofuels could adversely affect this segment\u2019s results of operations and could result in the potential impairment of the recorded value of the property, plant and equipment related to these facilities. Also, the federal blender\u2019s credits are not permanent and may not be renewed beyond 2022.\n(5) Difficulties Could Be Experienced in the Start-up of the New Renewable Diesel Production Facility. Commercial operations at this segment\u2019s new renewable diesel production facility are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2022, but the timing could be delayed further, and full capacity expectations could take longer than planned. Difficulties encountered in the start-up of operations could have adverse effects on results of operations.\nSpecific Commodity Trading and Milling Segment Risks\n(1) This Segment Uses a Material Amount of Derivative Products to Manage Certain Market Risks. The commodity trading portion of this segment enters into various commodity derivative and foreign exchange derivative transactions to create what management believes is an economic hedge for commodity trades it executes or intends to execute with its customers. Failure to execute or improper execution of a derivative position, or a firmly committed sale or purchase contract, or a speculative transaction that closes without the desired result or exposure to counter party risk could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and liquidity.\n(2) This Segment Faces Increasing Competition from Several Sources. This segment is experiencing increasing competition in certain foreign markets by well-capitalized originators, traders of commodities making sales directly to end-use customers and industrial-asset owners that compete in the same markets as this segment. If various competing raw-material originators refuse to sell commodities to Seaboard for sale in these foreign markets, it could be more challenging for this segment to purchase commodities for sale to its customers at competitive prices. Also, competition with imported products or other local producers impact this segment\u2019s industrial operations. This segment\u2019s sales volume and sale prices for commodities to customers, as well as results of operations, could be adversely impacted by such increased competition.\nSpecific Marine Segment Risks\n(1) This Segment\u2019s Services Are Affected by International Trade and Fluctuating Freight Rates. This segment provides cargo shipping services in the U.S. and in many different countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America. In addition to the risks of overseas operations, fluctuations in economic conditions, inflation and unstable or hostile local political situations in the countries in which this segment operates could affect trade volumes and cargo freight rates, as well as adversely affect this segment\u2019s results of operations.\n(2) Chartered Ships Are Subject to Fluctuating Rates and Availability. Time-charter expenses are one of this segment\u2019s largest expenses. These costs, and availability of ships, can vary greatly due to a number of factors including the worldwide supply and demand for shipping. It is not possible to determine in advance whether a long-term charter contract will be favorable to this segment\u2019s business. Accordingly, entering into either long-term charter hire contracts during periods of decreasing charter hire costs or short-term charter hire contracts during periods of increasing charter hire costs could have an adverse effect on this segment\u2019s results of operations. To improve cargo services on higher frequency routes and generate more capacity, this segment purchases space, also known as slots, on certain third-party operated vessels. It is expected that this segment will continue purchasing slots in the future, but these ship providers may not be reliable and cause shipment delays or other challenges.\n(3) Hurricanes or Other Adverse Weather Conditions May Disrupt Operations. This segment\u2019s port operations can be subject to disruption due to hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions, which could have an adverse effect on this segment\u2019s results of operations.\nSpecific Sugar and Alcohol Segment Risks\n(1) This Segment Depends on the Condition of the Argentine Economy, Currency and Political Climate. This segment operates a sugar mill, alcohol production and power generation facility in Argentina. Fluctuations in economic conditions or changes in the Argentine political climate could have an impact on the costs of operations, the sales prices of products, export opportunities and the exchange rate of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. Local sales prices for retail sugar and bioethanol are affected by government price controls, and domestic prices for sugar are affected by import duties imposed by the Argentine government, impacting local volume sold, as well as imported and exported volumes to and from international markets. If import duties are changed, this could have a negative impact on the sales prices of this segment\u2019s products. In addition, the majority of this segment\u2019s sales are within Argentina, and any Argentine government attempts to control inflation through retail price controls on mass consumption products, including sugar, could adversely impact the local sales prices of this segment\u2019s products and the results of operations for this segment. In the second quarter of 2018, Argentina was determined to be a highly inflationary economy.\n(2) This Segment Is Subject to Weather, Crop Disease and Pests Risks. This segment may be adversely affected by numerous factors over which this segment has little or no control, including adverse weather and growing conditions, pest and disease problems. Of these risks, weather particularly could adversely affect the amount and quality of the sugarcane produced by this segment and its competitors located in other regions of Argentina.\n(3) The Loss or Closure of This Segment\u2019s Sole Processing Facility Would Adversely Affect the Business. This segment is largely dependent on the continued operation of a single sugar mill. The loss of or damage to this mill for any reason, including highly pathogenic disease outbreaks, fire, tornado or earthquake, or the occurrence of adverse governmental action or labor unrest resulting in labor strikes could adversely affect the business of this segment.\n(4) Labor Relations Challenges Could Adversely Affect Operations. This segment is dependent on unionized labor at its single sugar mill in Argentina. The political and economic environment in Argentina makes labor relations very challenging. Contributing to the situation are the historical policies of Argentina\u2019s government and the failure of the Argentine courts to enforce contractual obligations with unions and basic property rights. Interruptions in production as a result of labor unrest could adversely impact the quantity of sugarcane harvested\nand the amount of sugar, alcohol and power produced and could interfere with the distribution of products stored at the facility.\nSpecific Power Segment Risks\n(1) This Segment\u2019s Services Are Affected by Competition from More Efficient Energy Producers. This segment sells the power it generates primarily to government-owned distribution companies, and the government can decide which power units will be able to operate. Typically, dispatch is done based on a merit list with lower-cost power plants dispatched before those with higher costs. More efficient power producer competitors, such as from renewable energy, including hydro, solar, and wind, or other nonrenewable energy sources like coal, are less costly to operate, and could cause the demand for this segment\u2019s energy to decline and the spot market rates to decline as well, which will adversely affect this segment\u2019s results of operations.\n(2) Difficulties Could Be Experienced in the Start-up of the New Power Generating Barge. Commercial operations at this segment\u2019s new power generating barge, EDM III, are expected to commence in 2022, but not at full capacity. Timing could be delayed further, and full capacity expectations could take longer than planned. Difficulties encountered in the start-up of operations could have adverse effects on this segment\u2019s results of operations.\n(3) Supply of Natural Gas Is Limited in the Dominican Republic. Supply of natural gas in the Dominican Republic is limited to one primary supplier. EDM III will only operate on natural gas, but EDM II can run on other types of fuel. Supply disruptions of natural gas could have an adverse impact on this segment\u2019s operating income.\n(4) This Segment Depends on the Condition of the Dominican Republic Economy, Currency and Political Climate. Fluctuations in economic conditions or changes in the Dominican Republic political climate could have an impact on the costs of operations, the sales prices of products and the exchange rate of the Dominican peso to the U.S. dollar. In addition to significant currency fluctuations and the other risks of overseas operations, this segment could experience difficulty in obtaining timely collections of trade receivables from the government-owned distribution companies or other companies that must also collect from the government in order to make payments on their accounts. Currently, the Dominican Republic does not allow a free market to enable prices to rise with demand as the supply is restricted due to insufficient cash flow from electric distributors and the subsidy the government provides, which could limit this segment\u2019s profitability. As a result, the government has the ability to arbitrarily decide which power units will be able to operate, which can ultimately determine spot market prices for electricity generated and sold into the power grid and, therefore, could have adverse effects on this segment\u2019s results of operations.\n(5) This Segment May Be Unable to Renew Certain Permits. This segment\u2019s barges are subject to various permitting requirements imposed by the Dominican government. A major risk inherent in this segment\u2019s operations is the need to renew permits, and any delay or failure to obtain a renewal permit could have a significant impact on this segment\u2019s operations.\nSpecific Turkey Segment Risks\n(1) Increases in Costs of Butterball\u2019s Feed Components Could Adversely Affect Costs and Operating Margins. Feed costs are the most significant single component of the cost of raising turkeys and could be materially affected by commodity price fluctuations for corn, soybean meal and other commodity inputs, as well as inflation. Butterball\u2019s results may be negatively affected by increased costs of the feed components. Butterball attempts to manage some of these risks through the use of commodity derivatives; however, this may also limit its ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Unless wholesale turkey prices correspondingly increase, increases in the prices of Butterball\u2019s feed components would adversely affect Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(2) Adverse Operating Results or Inability to Renew Financing Could Result in Need for Raising Additional Capital. Butterball has third-party bank loan facilities that are secured by substantially all of the assets of Butterball. Adverse operating results could cause Butterball to default on such loan facilities or cause lenders to not renew or extend existing financing, which could result in a significant adverse impact on Butterball\u2019s financial position. As a result, Seaboard or other investors may need to make additional capital investment or provide financing to Butterball, which could adversely impact Butterball\u2019s results of operations, liquidity position or negatively impact the value, or cause dilution, of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(3) Decreased Perception of Value in the Butterball Brand and Changes in Consumer Preferences Could Adversely Affect Sales Quantity and Price of Butterball Products. Butterball is a premium brand name, built on a long history of offering quality products that has been differentiated in the market. The value of the Butterball brand allows for sales of a higher unit price for certain products compared to other turkey providers. In order to maintain\nthis advantage, Butterball must continue to support the brand with successful marketing efforts and develop new products. Consumer product preferences continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer lifestyles; digital shopping patterns; and competitive product and pricing pressures. If Butterball\u2019s products fail to meet consumer preferences, or Butterball fails to introduce new products or product extensions on a timely basis, the brand value could diminish significantly. In addition, negative news reports for any reason related to Butterball or the turkey/poultry industry could negatively impact this brand perception, Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(4) The Loss of Closure of Butterball\u2019s Primary Further Processing Facility Could Adversely Affect Butterball\u2019s Business. Although Butterball has three processing plants and three further processing plants, Butterball is disproportionately dependent on the continued operation of the processing plant in North Carolina, that handles a significant volume of the production of further processed turkey products. The closure, even temporarily, loss of or damage to this plant for any reason, including highly pathogenic disease outbreaks, fire, hurricane, tornado, or the occurrence of an adverse governmental action could adversely affect the results of operations and financial position for Butterball and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.\n(5) Health Risk to Poultry Could Adversely Affect Production, the Supply of Raw Materials and Butterball\u2019s Business. Butterball is subject to risks relating to its ability to maintain animal health and control diseases, such as avian influenza. The general health of the turkeys and reproductive performance could have an adverse impact on production and production costs, the supply of raw material to Butterball\u2019s processing operations and consumer confidence. If Butterball\u2019s turkeys are affected by disease, Butterball may be required to destroy infected birds, which could adversely affect Butterball\u2019s production or ability to sell or export its products. Adverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of Butterball products, resulting in an adverse effect on Butterball\u2019s results of operations and the value of Seaboard\u2019s investment in Butterball.", "PERMNO": 36281, "SIC": 9997, "TIC": "SEB"}
