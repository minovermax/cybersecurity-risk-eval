{"cik": "1178711", "company": "Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this report before you decide to purchase our common stock. If any of the possible adverse events described below actually occurs, we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and operating results could be harmed. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of the events described below, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.\nRisk Related to Financial Condition\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur losses for the foreseeable future. To date we have not generated sufficient revenue from product sales to cover corresponding expenses and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe received FDA approval for NUZYRA in October 2018 and launched NUZYRA in the U.S. in February 2019. Additionally, FDA approval was granted in October 2018 for SEYSARA, which Almirall has rights to commercialize and with respect to which we will be entitled to tiered royalties, on net sales in the U.S. and a flat royalty on net sales in the greater China region. SEYSARA was launched in the U.S. in January 2019. Although NUZYRA and SEYSARA are now being sold by us and Almirall, respectively, it will take some time to attain profitability and we may never do so. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $128.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was $711.3 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we seek to maintain and expand regulatory approvals for our products, continue to commercialize NUZYRA, establish our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize products for which we obtain marketing approval, including NUZYRA, and add personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts and operations. The net losses and negative operating cash flows incurred to date, together with expected future losses, have had, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit) and working capital. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate future revenue.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to generate any sufficient product revenues to achieve profitability. For example, our expenses could increase if we are required by regulatory agencies outside of the U.S. to perform studies in addition to those that we have already performed or currently expect to perform.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing products with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including manufacturing, marketing and commercializing approved products, such as NUZYRA, developing product candidates and obtaining regulatory approval for them. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenue from product sales that is significant enough to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become or remain profitable would depress the market value of our common stock, could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, develop other product candidates or continue our operations and could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments.\nWe may continue to require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not available, may require us to delay, scale back or cease our product development programs or commercialization efforts for NUZYRA.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $215.4 million. We will require substantial additional funding to meet FDA post-marketing approval requirements for NUZYRA, which we expect to be funded through the BARDA contract. Additional funding may also be needed to support and accelerate the commercialization of NUZYRA, to fund the development of omadacycline in other indications, including NTM, and to advance the development of potential other product candidates, and such funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, based upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because the profitability of NUZYRA and SEYSARA, and the successful development of any other future product candidates, is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require to fund our continuing operations, including for our clinical development programs and commercialization efforts for NUZYRA.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe progress of clinical development of omadacycline in additional indications, including NTM;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of commercialization activities for NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nproduct revenue received from commercial sales of NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nroyalty revenue received from commercial sales of SEYSARA by Almirall;\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of actual reimbursements and NUZYRA purchases under the BARDA contract;\n\u2022\nthe ability of Zai to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline in the Zai territory;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of seeking, obtaining, maintaining and expanding FDA and non-U.S. regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with manufacturing and establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, commercial, operations and medical personnel;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our products;\n\u2022\nour need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems\n\u2022\nresources required to develop and implement policies and processes to promote ongoing compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncosts required to ensure that our and our partners\u2019 business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nthe economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or royalty payments under such arrangements.\nUntil we generate a sufficient amount of product and royalty revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt or other structured financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in securing additional funds on acceptable terms. If additional funds are not available, we may be forced to cease operations, significantly reduce operating expenses or delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our business operations.\nRaising additional capital or entering into certain other arrangements may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities, which would dilute shareholder ownership interest. The terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect shareholders\u2019 rights as common stockholders. Future debt financing, if available at all, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, NUZYRA, sarecycline, any future product candidates or future revenue streams, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funding if and when necessary. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we could be required to grant rights to develop and market NUZYRA, sarecycline or any future product candidates that we may otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur level of indebtedness and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and may make it more difficult for us to fund our operations.\nOn June 27, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or the Amended Hercules Loan Agreement, with Hercules Technology III, L.P., certain other lenders, together, the Lenders, and Hercules Capital, Inc. (as agent), under which the Company may borrow up to $100.0 million in multiple tranches, each, a Term Loan Tranche. The Amended Hercules Loan Agreement amends and restates in its entirety our prior Loan and Security Agreement dated as of September 30, 2015, as amended. As of December 31, 2019, we have drawn down on $70.0 million. The Amended Hercules Loan Agreement provides for an extension of the scheduled maturity date of the $60.0 million Term Loan Tranche, or the First Tranche, from September 1, 2021 to September 1, 2023, upon certain events set forth in the Amended Hercules Loan Agreement, and an extension of the scheduled maturity date of the $10.0 million Term Loan Tranche, or the Second Tranche, and additional Term Loan Tranches (if any), from August 1, 2022 to August 1, 2024, upon certain events set forth in the Amended Hercules Loan Agreement. The Amended Hercules Loan Agreement also provides for an additional $10.0 million of additional Term Loan Tranches (up to a total of $30.0 million of additional Term Loan Tranches), or the Additional Tranches, that may be available to the Company, subject to approval by Hercules, in its sole discretion, whether to provide such tranches. As such there can be no assurance as to whether or not the Additional Tranches shall be funded.\nAll obligations under the Amended Hercules Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our existing property and assets, excluding our intellectual property. This indebtedness may create additional financing risk for us, particularly if our business or prevailing financial market conditions are not conducive to paying off or refinancing our outstanding debt obligations at maturity. This indebtedness could also have important negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nwe will need to repay our indebtedness by making payments of interest and principal, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations, our research and development efforts and other general corporate activities; and\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the affirmative, restrictive or financial covenants in the Amended Hercules Loan Agreement could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our obligation to repay this indebtedness, and Hercules could seek to enforce its security interest in the assets securing such indebtedness.\nIn April 2018, we issued $165.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, or the Notes. The Notes bear cash interest at the annual rate of 4.75%, payable on November 1 and May 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018, and mature on May 1, 2024 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.\nIn addition, on February 25, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Paratek Royalty Corporation, or the Subsidiary, entered into a royalty-backed loan agreement, or the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P., or HCRP. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement, the Subsidiary borrowed a $32.5 million loan, which was secured by, and is being repaid based upon, royalties from the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. The Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement matures on May 1, 2029, at which time, if not earlier repaid in full, the outstanding principal amount of the loan, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, and all other obligations then outstanding, shall be due and payable in cash by the Subsidiary.\nThe Royalty-Backed Loan Agreement contains customary defined events of default, upon which any outstanding principal and unpaid interest shall be immediately due and payable. These include: failure to pay any principal or interest when due\u037e any uncured breach of a representation, warranty or covenant\u037e any uncured failure to perform or observe covenants\u037e any uncured cross default under a material contract\u037e any uncured breach of our representations, warranties or covenants under its Contribution and Servicing Agreement with the Subsidiary\u037e any termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement\u037e and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events.\nTo the extent additional debt (including without limitation the Additional Tranches) is added to our current debt levels, the risks described above could increase.\nWe may not have cash available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest or principal payments on our indebtedness when due.\nFailure to satisfy our current and future debt obligations under the Amended Hercules Loan Agreement could result in an event of default and, as a result, Hercules could accelerate all of the amounts due. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under the Amended Hercules Loan Agreement as a result of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness. In addition, Hercules could seek to enforce its security interests in the assets securing such indebtedness.\nWe are subject to certain restrictive covenants which, if breached, could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe Hercules Loan Agreement imposes operating and other restrictions on us. Such restrictions will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability and the ability of any future subsidiary to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\nchange our lines of business;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make distributions or repurchase our capital stock; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nRisks Related to Maintaining and Expanding Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf clinical trials for omadacycline are prolonged, delayed or stopped, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize omadacycline for the treatment of additional indications on a timely basis.\nIn October 2018, the FDA approved NUZYRA in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with CABP and ABSSSI that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. The completion of any future clinical trials, including FDA PMRs, could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of the product candidate for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of the comparator antibiotic for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe limited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct our clinical trials, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as our product candidates;\n\u2022\nany delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval or agreement to commence a clinical trial in any of the countries where enrollment is planned;\n\u2022\nclinical holds on, or other regulatory objections to, a new or ongoing clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites or clinical research organizations, or CROs, or local regulatory authorities, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different sites or CROs; and\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain Institutional Review Board/ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site or within a specific region or country.\nThe completion of our clinical trials could also be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u2022\nfailure of patients to complete the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues, including severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects experienced by patients;\n\u2022\nlack of omadacycline efficacy evidenced during clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntermination of our clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of patients or clinical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment by us and/or our CROs;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of omadacycline or of the relevant comparator product; and\n\u2022\nthe need to repeat or terminate clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications during clinical trial testing.\nIn particular, our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis will be subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population needed, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant indication and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may also occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. Amendments may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to regulatory agencies/ Institutional Review Boards/ethics committees for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. Our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, the Institutional Review Board overseeing the clinical trial at issue, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site or us due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues or any determination that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions; and\n\u2022\nupon a breach or pursuant to the terms of any agreement with, or for any other reason by, current or future collaborators that have responsibility for the clinical development of any of our product candidates.\nIn addition, clinical practices vary globally, and there is a lack of harmonization among the guidance provided by various regulatory bodies of different regions and countries with respect to the data that is required to receive marketing approval, which makes designing global trials increasingly complex. Differing regulatory approval requirements in different countries also make it more difficult for us to conduct unified global trials, which can lead to increased development costs and marketing delays or non-viability of our clinical trials. The approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval also varies among countries. Furthermore, regulatory agencies may have varying interpretations of the same data, and approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions.\nThe results of previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of any ongoing or future clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or our partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing which could delay submission of a supplemental NDA and regulatory approval. We will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Success in early stage clinical trials does not mean that future larger registration clinical trials will be successful, because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities despite having progressed through early stage clinical trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage (pre-Phase 3) clinical trials may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent registration clinical trials.\nIn addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and/or new indications, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is underway, well advanced or completed. Further, if future product candidates are found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for them and our business would be harmed. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier stage clinical trials.\nPositive results in our randomized Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies of omadacycline in complicated skin and skin structure infections, ABSSSI and CABP, may not be predictive of the results in any other indications, such as omadacycline for the treatment of NTM. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in clinical trial protocols, differences in size, type and geographic distribution of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical trials we or any of our collaborators may conduct, or have conducted in the past, will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our future product candidates.\nFurther, our and our partners\u2019 product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their primary endpoints in Phase 3 clinical trials or registration trials. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials even when we have Special Protocol Assessment agreements. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that has the potential to result in FDA or other agencies\u2019 approval. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may also approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that we believe would be supported by the clinical data, or be necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our products. If an unforeseen safety issue arises, the FDA always has the option to initiate a REMS or add additional warnings to a product label upon approval.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our partners from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Regulations differ from country to country, which will require us to expend additional resources in each market for which a separate regulatory approval is required. We are not permitted to market our product candidates outside of the U.S. until we receive marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. Although omadacycline and sarecycline received FDA approval, approval of other indications, including treatment of NTM with omadacycline, is subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development.\nFailure to comply with FDA and non-U.S. regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, if any, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities also have substantial discretion in the drug approval process. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u2022\nthe results may not confirm the positive results from earlier preclinical studies or earlier stage clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may not approve our third-party manufacturer\u2019s processes or facilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may require significant warning or restrictions on use to the product label; or\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nAny delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from omadacycline or any other particular product candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. These limitations may limit the size of the market opportunity for the product.\nEven though NUZYRA and SEYSARA have been approved by the FDA in the U.S., they face post-approval development and regulatory requirements, which may limit how they are manufactured and marketed, and could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nIn October 2018, the FDA approved NUZYRA in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with CABP and ABSSSI that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, as well as SEYSARA for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older. NUZYRA and SEYSARA are subject to, among other things, ongoing FDA requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety, efficacy and other post-market information. As part of the FDA approval for NUZYRA, we are required to conduct post-marketing pediatric studies, including a single dose pharmacokinetic and safety study in children ages eight to seventeen who are receiving antibacterial drug therapy for an infectious disease, an active-controlled safety study in children ages eight to seventeen who have acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, and an active-controlled safety study in children ages eight to seventeen who have CABP. In addition, we are also required to conduct an active-controlled safety and efficacy study in adults with CABP and a U.S. surveillance study for five years from the date of marketing to determine if resistance to NUZYRA has developed in those organisms specific to the indications in the label. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and other regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current GMP regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. As such, we and our partners and any of our and their respective contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMPs. Additionally, to the extent we want to make certain changes to the approved products, product labeling, or manufacturing processes or manufacturing sites, we will need to submit new applications or supplements to FDA and obtain the agency\u2019s approval.\nAccordingly, we and others with whom we work will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We and our partners are also required to report adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to comply with requirements concerning, among other things, advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of drug treatment made in the physician\u2019s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from pharmaceutical companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. Accordingly, we and our partners will not be able to promote our products for indications or uses for which they are not approved. A company that is found to have promoted off-label use of its product may be subject to significant liability, including civil and criminal sanctions. We intend to comply with the requirements and restrictions of the FDA and other regulatory agencies with respect to off-label promotion, but we cannot be sure that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will agree that we have not violated their restrictions. As a result, we may be subject to criminal and civil liability. If the FDA or any other governmental agency initiates an enforcement action against us or if we are the subject of a qui tam suit and it is determined that we violated prohibitions relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal fines or damage awards and other sanctions such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which our activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Even if it is later determined that we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. We intend to engage in medical education activities and communicate with healthcare providers in compliance with all applicable laws, regulatory guidance and industry best practices. Although we believe we have put in place a compliance program, which is designed to ensure that all such activities are performed in a legal and compliant manner, we cannot be certain that our program will address all areas of potential exposure and the risks in this area cannot be entirely eliminated.\nAdditionally, if a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, it may impose restrictions on that product, us or our partners, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we or our partners fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could impose significant penalties, such as:\n\u2022\nissuance of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nimposition of injunctions or civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nimposition of fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nimposition of total or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseizure or detainment of products or requirements for us or our partners to initiate a product recall.\nIf we and our partners are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur products may have undesirable side effects that may require them to be taken off the market or otherwise limit their sales.\nAlthough NUZYRA and SEYSARA have undergone safety testing in humans and in laboratory animals, not all adverse effects of drugs can be predicted or anticipated from these clinical studies and preclinical safety and toxicology studies. Unforeseen side effects from either NUZYRA or SEYSARA could arise after the approved product has been marketed. Many of the most widely used antibiotics are associated with treatment-limiting adverse events, including in some instances, kidney damage, allergic reactions or sudden cardiovascular death due to cardiac arrhythmia. The results of future clinical trials or from marketing experience may show that NUZYRA or SEYSARA, or any other current or future product candidate, cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects. Furthermore, even though both NUZYRA and SEYSARA have received marketing approval, if we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by NUZYRA or SEYSARA:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nwe or our partners may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nwe or our partners may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product;\n\u2022\nsales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of an approved product, or otherwise require us or our partners to take our approved product off the market, or impose restrictions on its distribution;\n\u2022\nwe or our partners may be subject to litigation or product liability claims and be held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us, our current partners or our potential future partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from the sale of our products. Furthermore, NUZYRA and SEYSARA are commercially available and each may be used in a wider population and in a less rigorously controlled environment than in clinical studies. As a result, regulatory authorities, healthcare practitioners, third-party payors or patients may perceive or conclude that the use of the product is associated with previously unknown serious adverse effects, undermining commercialization efforts.\nCoverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance. If there is not sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our products, it is less likely that our products will be widely used.\nMarket acceptance and sales of NUZYRA, SEYSARA and any of our or our partners\u2019 other products will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health plans, decide which drugs they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement may vary among third-party payors. Coverage may not be available, and reimbursement may not be adequate, for NUZYRA, SEYSARA or any other products that we or our partners develop and commercialize. Also, coverage and reimbursement policies may reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our or our partners\u2019 products. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our or our partners\u2019 products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such products. Therefore, if coverage is not available or reimbursement is limited, we and our partners may not be able to successfully commercialize NUZYRA, SEYSARA or any future approved products, if any.\nThird-party payors may limit coverage or impose conditions on coverage. For example, third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. As another example, third-party payors may require use of alternative therapies or a demonstration that a product is medically necessary for a particular patient before use of a product will be covered. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products could reduce utilization of those products.\nA third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will apply, or patient copayment will be at an acceptable level for physicians to choose to prescribe our drug. In addition, pharmaceutical companies often need to offer third party payors rebates and administration fees on the cost of drugs dispensed to the payors\u2019 members in order to increase the possibility of favorable coverage and adequate cost sharing thresholds for patients. We may be required to provide such rebates to some third-party payors in relation to our product(s). Adequate third-party reimbursement, taking into account such rebates as applicable, may not be available and we may not be able to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate profit, including a return on our investment in product development.\nOutside of the U.S., in some countries, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take a significant amount of time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. In some countries, we or our partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available products in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to sell approved products profitably. Among policymakers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nThe U.S. government and individual states have aggressively pursued healthcare reform, as evidenced by the passage of the Healthcare Reform Act and the ongoing efforts to modify or repeal that legislation. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care and assessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Modifications have been implemented under the Trump Administration and additional modifications or repeal may occur. For instance, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the individual health insurance mandate which is expected to increase the number of Americans without comprehensive health insurance. In December of 2018, a federal district court also found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety. In December 2019, a federal appeals court agreed that the individual mandate provision was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the district court to assess more carefully whether any provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act were severable and could survive. Pending action by the district court and resolution of any appeals, which could take some time, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational in all respects. Other aspects of healthcare reform, such as expanded government enforcement authority could also affect our business and are ongoing. See \u201cGovernment Regulation - Health Care and Other Reform\u201d. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts.\nAdditional legislative actions to control U.S. healthcare or other costs have passed. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare, but not Medicaid, payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken.\nThere is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform or other legislative and regulatory initiatives will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nIn the U.S. there is increasing scrutiny of drug prices and federal or state reforms could impact our ability to establish what we believe is a fair price for our products, and ultimately diminish our revenue prospects.\nRecently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny in the U.S. of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been several recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices or price increases. Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates, if approved for sale and could diminish our ability to establish what we believe is a fair price for our products, ultimately diminishing our revenue for our products.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs in the U.S., we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and a number of other federal and state government pricing programs in the U.S. in order to obtain coverage for NUZYRA by certain government healthcare programs. These programs generally require us to pay rebates or provide discounts to certain private purchasers or government payers in connection with our products when dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. In some cases, such as with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the government agencies that administer the programs. The terms, scope and complexity of these government pricing programs change frequently. We may also have reimbursement obligations or be subject to penalties if we fail to provide timely and accurate information to the government, pay the correct rebates or offer the correct discounted pricing. Changes to the price reporting or rebate requirements of these programs would affect our obligations to pay rebates or offer discounts. Responding to current and future changes may increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, will be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we or our partners market products in a manner that violates fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, or if we or our partners violate government price reporting laws, we or our partners may be subject to administrative civil and/or criminal penalties.\nWithin the U.S., various state and federal healthcare laws restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. When we or any of our partners market approved products, such as NUZYRA or SEYSARA, some of our or our partners\u2019 business activities could possibly be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. The laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nfederal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws prohibiting, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid;\n\u2022\nfederal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibit, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nfederal anti-kickback prohibition known as Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act or EKRA, enacted in 2018, which prohibits certain payments related to referrals of patients to certain providers (recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities and laboratories) and applies to services reimbursed by private health plans as well as government health care programs;\n\u2022\nthe federal law known as HIPAA, which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nthe FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples;\n\u2022\nfederal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nthe so-called \u201cfederal sunshine\u201d law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with certain healthcare providers to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public (the scope of which reportable interactions will increase for interactions occurring during or after 2021); and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws regulating interactions between pharmaceutical manufactures and healthcare providers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our and our partners\u2019 business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. With the approval of NUZYRA and SEYSARA, we have become subject to an expanded number of these laws and have, and will need to continue, to expend resources to develop and implement policies and processes to promote ongoing compliance. Although we believe we currently maintain an appropriate compliance program, we cannot be certain that the program will adequately detect or prevent violations.\nMany of these laws and their implementing regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to challenge. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our or our partners\u2019 business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our or our partners\u2019 operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we or our partners may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could significantly harm our business.\nPharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing activities, such as: providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates.\nOutside of the U.S., foreign laws may also regulate our activities, or those of our collaboration partners.\nWe may be subject to significant fines if we fail to comply with data privacy and securities laws.\nWe may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.\nWithin the U.S., our operations may be affected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, collectively, HIPAA, which impose obligations on certain \u201ccovered entities,\u201d such as healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and certain of their \u201cbusiness associate\u201d contractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Although we believe that we currently are neither a \u201ccovered entity\u201d nor a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d under the legislation, a business associate relationship may be imputed from facts and circumstances even in the absence of an actual business associate agreement. In addition, HIPAA may affect our interactions with customers who are covered entities or their business associates because HIPAA affects the ability of these entities to disclose patient health information to us. Various states also have laws that regulate the privacy and security of patient information and so may affect our business operations. For example, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers, defined to include all California residents, certain rights, including the right to ask companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, specific pieces of information collected by a company, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer\u2019s personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom a company shares personal information. The CCPA also imposes several obligations on companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding a company\u2019s data processing activities. Additionally, the CCPA gives California consumers the right to ask companies to delete a consumer\u2019s personal information and it places limitations on a company\u2019s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information.\nOutside the U.S., other data privacy and security regulations may apply. For example, the processing of personal data in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, exercising data subject rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals, as well as how we document our relationships with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA, including from clinical trial sites in the EEA, to countries that are considered by the European Commission to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. Compliance with data privacy and security regulation can require allocation of resources as well as changes in operations and non-compliance can result in substantial fines. In addition, the GDPR and the CCPA impose substantial fines and other regulatory penalties for breaches of data protection requirements and they confer a private right of action on data subjects, in the case of the GDPR, and consumers, in the case of the CCPA, and their representatives for breaches of certain data protection requirements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are highly dependent on the commercial success of NUZYRA in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, SEYSARA.\nOur success is currently dependent on the successful commercialization of NUZYRA in the U.S., which is also being developed by Zai in the Zai territory, and, to a lesser extent, SEYSARA, which Almirall has the rights to commercialize in the U.S. and the greater China region. We are not currently developing, and have no such plans to develop, any other product candidates, other than omadacycline for the treatment of NTM, anthrax, and other relevant preclinical or clinical investigations. We may need additional financing or grants to fund development of any current or future product candidates.\nThe majority of our time, resources and effort are focused on the commercialization of NUZYRA and our ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on the successful commercialization of NUZYRA, which will depend on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsecure sufficient starting materials and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nproduce, through a validated process, sufficient quantities and inventory of NUZYRA to meet demand;\n\u2022\nbuild and maintain internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities sufficient to generate commercial sales of NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nsecure widespread acceptance of our product from physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community;\n\u2022\nproperly price and obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement of NUZYRA by governmental authorities, private health insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nmaintain compliance with ongoing FDA labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, safety and other PMRs;\n\u2022\nmanage our costs and expenses commensurate with NUZYRA\u2019s projected growth; and\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of NUZYRA in countries outside of the U.S., such as our existing collaboration with Zai to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline in the Zai territory, and such collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in such countries.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. In addition, we have begun, and will need to continue investing substantial financial and management resources to build out our commercial infrastructure and to recruit and train sufficient additional qualified marketing, sales and other personnel in support of our sales of NUZYRA.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease occurs, our business may be adversely affected. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus continues to spread globally and, as of March 2020, has spread to over 50 countries, including the U.S. Such events may result in a period of business and manufacturing disruption, and in reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. may result in travel restrictions impacting our sales professionals. In addition, hospitals may reduce staffing, divert resources to patients suffering from the infectious disease or limit access for non-patients, including our sales professionals, which could negatively impact the ability of our sales professionals to effectively access physicians. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our sales of NUZYRA.\nSales of NUZYRA and SEYSARA may be slow or limited for a variety of reasons including competing therapies or safety issues. If NUZYRA and SEYSARA are not successful in gaining broad commercial acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nSales of NUZYRA and SEYSARA are dependent on several factors including our and our partners\u2019 ability to educate and increase physician awareness of the benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness of NUZYRA and SEYSARA relative to competing therapies. The degree of market acceptance of NUZYRA and SEYSARA among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nacceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022\npricing, cost effectiveness and value propositions;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of our sales and marketing capability and strategies;\n\u2022\ncomplications or barriers that inhibit our commercial team from reaching the appropriate audience to promote our product(s) because of the spread of the coronavirus or any outbreak of other contagious diseases, especially during the early phase of our commercial launch of NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which NUZYRA and SEYSARA are approved, as well as changes in the standard of care for their targeted indications;\n\u2022\nthe continuing effectiveness of manufacturing and supply chain;\n\u2022\nwarnings and limitations contained in the approved labeling for NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nwarnings and limitations contained in the approved labeling for SEYSARA, including that efficacy of SEYSARA beyond 12 weeks and safety beyond 12 months have not been established;\n\u2022\nsafety concerns with similar products marketed by others;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects as a result of treatment with NUZYRA and SEYSARA;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with FDA PMRs associated with the FDA approval of NUZYRA, including conducting and completing post-marketing studies; and\n\u2022\nthe actual market-size for NUZYRA and SEYSARA, which may be larger or smaller than expected.\nIn addition, since NUZYRA and SEYSARA are subject to continual review by the FDA, there can be no assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise. With the use of any newly marketed drug by a wider patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the drug itself. For example, any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing NUZYRA, cause us to modify how we market NUZYRA, and may subject us to substantial liabilities and adversely affect our revenues and financial condition. In the event of a withdrawal of NUZYRA from the market, our revenues would decline significantly, and our business would be seriously harmed and could fail. We and our partners additionally may experience significant fluctuations in sales of NUZYRA and SEYSARA from period to period and, ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenues from NUZYRA and SEYSARA to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated operations.\nWe face significant competition and if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our products, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change, including but not limited to with respect to innovations related to diagnostic devices. NUZYRA and SEYSARA do or will compete with other drugs and therapies that currently exist or are being developed. Products that we may develop in the future are also likely to face competition from other drugs and therapies, some of which we may not currently be aware. We have competitors both in the U.S. and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients and manufacturing pharmaceutical products. These companies also have significantly greater research, development and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds to in-license novel compounds or develop technologies, that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete or less competitive. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or regulatory approvals or discovering, developing and commercializing competing technologies before we do so for any of our product candidates.\nThe GAIN Act is intended to provide incentives for the development of new Qualified Infectious Disease Products. These incentives may result in more competition in the market for new antibiotics and may cause pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with more resources than we have to shift their efforts toward the development of products that could be competitive with our product candidates.\nNUZYRA competes with other antibiotics in the serious bacterial skin infection market. These include, but are not limited to, vancomycin, marketed as a generic by Abbott Laboratories and others; linezolid, marketed as Zyvox by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; daptomycin, marketed as Cubicin by Merck Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and available as a generic; dalbavancin, approved in May 2014 and marketed as Dalvance by Allergan; tedizolid, marketed as Sivextro by Merck Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; delafloxacin marketed as Baxdela by Melinta Therapuetics, Inc.; oritavancin, approved in August 2014 and marketed as Orbactiv by Melinta Therapeutics,\nInc.; quinupristin/dalfopristin, marketed as Synercid by Pfizer, Inc.; tigecycline, marketed as Tygacil by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; telavancin, marketed as Vibativ by Cumberland Therpeutics Inc.; ceftaroline, marketed as Teflaro by Allergan; and the following generics: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracycline. We are also aware of various drugs that are or may eventually be under development for the treatment of serious skin infections, and these include but are not limited to: Iclaprim by Motif Bio and Lefamulin by Nabriva.\nNUZYRA competes with other antibiotics in the community-acquired pneumonia market. These include, but are not limited to, azithromycin, marketed as Zithromax and Z-PAK by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; clarithromycin, marketed as Biaxin by Abbott Laboratories and available as a generic; moxifloxacin, marketed as Avelox by Bayer AG and available as a generic; levofloxacin, marketed as Levaquin by Johnson & Johnson and available as a generic; tigecycline, marketed as Tygacil by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; linezolid, marketed as Zyvox by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; ceftriaxone, marketed as Rocephin by F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd and available as a generic; delafloxacin marketed as Baxdela by Melinta Therapeutics Inc; lefamulin marketed as Xenleta by Nabriva Therapeutics Inc. and ceftaroline, marketed as Teflaro by Allergan. We are also aware of various drugs that are or may eventually be under development for the treatment of CABP, including, but not limited to, radezolid, under development by Melinta Therapeutics; and GSK2140944, under development by GSK.\nFinally, SEYSARA faces competition in the acne markets where generic tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline are available in every market around the world. Branded generic versions of tetracycline derivatives are sold by several companies.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in the marketing of products, discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors\u2019 drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than NUZYRA, SEYSARA or any future product candidate we may commercialize and may render NUZYRA, SEYSARA or our other product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of our development and commercialization. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render NUZYRA, SEYSARA or any future product candidates non-competitive or obsolete.\nIn addition, many universities and private and public research institutes may become active in our target indications. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy, safety and reliability of NUZYRA, SEYSARA and our and our partners\u2019 other product candidates, including as relative to marketed products and product candidates in development by third parties;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to reliably secure starting materials and manufacture any of our formulations;\n\u2022\nthe speed at which we and our partners develop future product candidates;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to commercialize and market, or find partners to help or exclusively commercialize and market, NUZYRA, SEYSARA or any future product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials, as well as the results of such clinical trials, including our two Phase 2 registration clinical trials for omadacycline-one in cystitis, a common uncomplicated UTI, and one in acute pyelonephritis, a common complicated UTI;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to recruit and enroll patients for our and our partners\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to maintain a productive relationship with regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our, our current partners\u2019 or any future partners\u2019 marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe price of our products, including in comparison to branded or generic competitors;\n\u2022\ncoverage and adequate levels of reimbursement under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to protect and maintain intellectual property rights related to NUZYRA, SEYSARA and any of our or their other product candidates;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to manage costs and expenses commensurate with NUZYRA and SEYSARA\u2019s projected growth;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to maintain compliance with ongoing FDA labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, safety and other PMRs, including required post-marketing studies;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities at a reasonable cost of NUZYRA and SEYSARA; and\n\u2022\nacceptance of NUZYRA and SEYSARA by physicians and other healthcare providers.\nIn addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not economical.\nFurthermore, price competition may inhibit the acceptance of our products, physicians may be reluctant to switch from existing products to our products, physicians may switch to other newly approved drug products, or physicians may choose to reserve our products for use in limited circumstances.\nIf BARDA were to eliminate, reduce, or delay funding for our contract, we would experience a negative impact on our programs associated with such funding.\nOn December 18, 2019, we entered into a five-year contract, with an option to extend to ten years, with BARDA, a division of HHS. The objectives of our BARDA contract are to support the development of NUZYRA for the treatment of pulmonary anthrax and the fulfillment of FDA PMR associated with NUZRYA\u2019s initial approval. The BARDA contract also includes an option for BARDA to procure up to 10,000 treatment courses of NUZYRA for the SNS for use against potential biothreats. If BARDA were to eliminate, reduce, or delay funding for these programs or prohibit reimbursement of some of our incurred costs, we would have to seek additional funding to continue development of NUZYRA for the treatment of anthrax or significantly decrease or cease the product\u2019s development for that indication. Moreover, a loss of BARDA funding could jeopardize our ability to fulfill NUZYRA\u2019s FDA post-marketing requirements or to fulfill them in a timely manner, and FDA could take enforcement action against us, including by issuing a Warning Letter or by imposing civil monetary penalties.\nThe BARDA contract includes special requirements, which subject us to the risk of a reduction or loss of funding.\nOur BARDA contract subjects us to various U.S. government contract requirements, including general clauses for a cost-reimbursement research and development contract, which may limit our reimbursement. In addition, if we are found to be in violation of the BARDA contract, it could result in termination. If BARDA terminates our contract with us for its convenience, or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms, a significant negative impact on our cash flows and operations could result.\nU.S. government contracts, such as our BARDA contract, generally contain unfavorable termination provisions, which may subject us to additional risks as compared to our competitors that have not entered into such contracts. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government to unilaterally:\n\u2022\nterminate or reduce the scope of our contract with or without cause;\n\u2022\ninterpret relevant regulations (federal acquisition regulation clauses);\n\u2022\nrequire performance under circumstances which may not be favorable to us;\n\u2022\nrequire an in-process review where the U.S. government will review the project and its options under the contract;\n\u2022\ncontrol the timing and amount of funding, which impacts the development progress of our programs; and\n\u2022\naudit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.\nTermination and audit provisions in our BARDA contract could create additional risks for our business.\nThe U.S. government may terminate our BARDA contract for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms. Termination for convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our incurred or committed costs, and settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination does not permit these recoveries under default provisions. If our contract expires or is terminated, the U.S. government could dispute wind-down and termination costs and may question prior expenses under the contract and deny payment of those expenses. If we decide to challenge the U.S. government for denying certain payments under a contract, such a challenge could subject us to substantial additional expenses which we may or may not recover. Further, should the U.S. government terminate our BARDA contract for its convenience, or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms, our cash flows and business operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for manufacturing of NUZYRA and any future product candidates. Reliance on third- party manufacturers could impair the commercialization of NUZYRA or delay approval of any future product candidates.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of NUZYRA or any other product candidate, nor do we currently intend to manufacture NUZYRA or any other pharmaceutical products that we may plan to sell in the future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for NUZYRA. We have entered into certain long-term manufacturing and supply agreements. These include (i) a manufacturing and services agreement with CIPAN for the supply of starting materials for our supply of omadacycline and crude omadacycline, (ii) an outsourcing agreement with Carbogen for the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient for our omadacycline products, (iii) a manufacturing and services agreement with Almac for the supply of omadacycline oral solid dosage tablets, (iv) a packaging and supply agreement with Almac for the primary packing, labelling, storage and related services for omadacycline oral solid dosage tablets and the secondary packaging, labelling, storage and related services for injectable omadacycline in vials, (v) a manufacturing and services agreement with Patheon under which Patheon will manufacture, package and supply to us, omadacycline in injectable form and (vi) a third party logistics provider agreement with ICS (Amerisource Bergan Co.) under which ICS will perform distribution and logistics services. We are currently in discussions with other third-party manufacturers and may enter into additional long-term supply agreements with them. We may not be able to reach agreement with some of these contract manufacturers, or to identify and reach arrangement on satisfactory terms with other contract manufacturers, to manufacture NUZYRA or any future product candidates. Additionally, we anticipate that the facilities used by any contract manufacturer to manufacture NUZYRA or any future product candidates will be the subject of inspections by regulatory agencies before the FDA and other regulatory authorities that approve an NDA or marketing authorization for the product candidate manufactured at that facility. We will depend on these third-party manufacturing partners for compliance with the FDA\u2019s manufacturing requirements for finished products. If our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the FDA and other regulatory authorities\u2019 cGMP requirements, any future product candidates may not be approved or, in the case of NUZYRA, may be subject to delays in release and/or product recalls. While third-party manufacturers of NUZYRA have previously passed FDA and other regulatory agency inspections, we cannot provide assurance that they will pass such inspections in the future.\nFurthermore, any interruption of the development or operation of the manufacturing facilities due to, among other reasons, events such as order delays for equipment or materials, equipment malfunction, quality control and quality assurance issues, regulatory delays and possible negative effects of such delays on supply chains and expected timelines for product availability, production yield issues, shortages of qualified personnel, discontinuation of a facility or business or failure or damage to a facility by natural disasters or pandemics, could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available NUZYRA, other product candidates or materials. For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world. We maintain a supply chain structure that presently allows us to avoid the business effects of the current coronavirus outbreak. However, the future impact of this outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the coronavirus effects the producers of certain materials, or spreads broadly to other regions as is predicted, including to Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, Northern Ireland, or the U.S. or to the countries where Almirall contracts for the production of SEYSARA, or if the duration of the disruption is longer than anticipated, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products and product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nthe possibility of a breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties before we are able to arrange for a qualified replacement third-party manufacturer;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that third parties are unable to manufacture NUZYRA consistently in commercial quantities, at acceptable costs on expected timelines;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may not be able to maintain or secure manufacturers or manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and on satisfactory terms in order to meet our manufacturing needs; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the third parties may not be able to respond adequately to unexpected changes in demand forecasts that may result in either lost revenue or excessive inventory with decreasing shelf-life.\nAny of these factors could cause the delay of further commercialization of NUZYRA, delay the development and approval of any future product candidates, or cause us to incur higher costs or prevent us from commercializing any future product candidates successfully. Furthermore, if contract manufacturers fail to continuously meet FDA compliance standards or fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and could lose potential revenue. It may take one or more years to establish an alternative source of supply and to have any such new source approved by the FDA or any other relevant regulatory authorities.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of NUZYRA and any future product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize on a timely and competitive basis NUZYRA or any future product candidates that receive marketing approval.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with NUZYRA, SEYSARA or any of our or our partners\u2019 product candidates, or if existing generic antibiotics are viewed as being equally effective to NUZYRA, SEYSARA or any of our or our partners\u2019 product candidates, the sales of NUZYRA, SEYSARA or, if approved, such product candidates would be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA or marketing authorization application outside of the U.S. is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d that can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA in the U.S. Agency regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non- infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes in the U.S. and in nearly every pharmaceutical market around the world. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use, or labeling, as our product candidate and that the generic product is bioequivalent to ours, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our product candidate. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market, and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product is typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to ours or any of our partners\u2019 future products, if any, would materially adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our or any of our partners\u2019 products, including NUZYRA and SEYSARA. For example, vancomycin has been available in generic form for many years, and Zyvox (linezolid) is now available in generic form. We cannot yet ascertain what impact these generic products and any future approved generic products will have on sales of NUZYRA, SEYSARA or, if approved, any of our or our partners\u2019 product candidates.\nThe success of our business may be dependent on the actions of our collaborative partners.\nAn element of our business and funding strategy is to enter into collaborative arrangements with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who will finance or otherwise assist in the development, manufacture and marketing of products incorporating our technology, and who also provide us with funding in the form of milestone payments for progress in clinical development or regulatory approval. For example, we exclusively licensed rights to sarecycline for the treatment of acne in the U.S. to Allergan, who assigned such rights to Almirall, and Almirall is responsible for all clinical development, registration and commercialization in the U.S. of sarecycline for the treatment of acne. In addition, Almirall has an exclusive license to develop and commercialize sarecycline (i) for the treatment of acne in the greater China region and (ii) for the treatment of rosacea in the U.S., which converted to a non-exclusive license in December 2014 after Allergan did not exercise its development option with respect to rosacea. In April 2017, Paratek Bermuda Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc., entered into the Zai Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Zai an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline in the Zai territory for all human therapeutic and preventative uses other than biodefense. Zai is responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the licensed product in the Zai territory, at its sole cost with certain assistance from Paratek. On December 18, 2019 Paratek Bermuda Ltd. assigned its rights under the Agreement to Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAccordingly, our prospects will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain collaborative partners and to develop technologies and products that achieve the criteria for milestone payments. When we collaborate with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third party in the respective territory. In addition, our collaborative partners may have the right to abandon research or development projects and terminate applicable agreements, including funding obligations, prior to or upon the expiration of the agreed upon terms. We may not be successful in establishing or maintaining collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, collaborative partners may terminate funding before completion of projects, our product candidates may not achieve the criteria for milestone payments, our collaborative arrangements may not result in successful product commercialization, and we may not\nderive any revenue from such arrangements. For example, we previously entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Novartis for the development of omadacycline, which was terminated. To the extent that we are not able to develop and maintain collaborative arrangements, we would need substantial additional capital to undertake research, development and commercialization activities on our own, we may be forced to limit the number of our product candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize them, and we might fail to commercialize products or programs for which a suitable collaborator cannot be found.\nReliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nour collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected or in compliance with applicable laws;\n\u2022\nthe prioritization, amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their respective collaborations with us is not under our control;\n\u2022\nsome product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nour collaborators may elect not to proceed with the development of product candidates that we believe to be promising;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022\nsome of our collaborators might develop independently, or with others, products that could compete with our products;\n\u2022\na delay in the development timeline for omadacycline in the Zai territory would result in a potential loss of milestone payments and future royalties (if any) from the partnership under the Zai Collaboration Agreement;\n\u2022\nif the exclusive rights to sarecycline in the U.S. or the greater China region are returned to us by Almirall, or the rights to omadacycline in the Zai territory returned to us by Zai, we will need to establish a new development and commercialization partnership to further sarecycline in the U.S. and China (including Hong Kong and Macau) or omadacycline in the Zai territory. There can be no assurance that we would be able to find such a partner; and\n\u2022\ndevelopment, manufacture and commercialization efforts by Zai of omadacycline in the Zai territory and by Almirall of sarecycline in the greater China region could be adversely impacted by the effects of the coronavirus or any outbreak of contagious diseases.\nIf we are not able to establish and sustain additional partnerships, we may have to alter our commercialization and development plans, which could harm our business.\nWe may require additional funding to support and accelerate commercialization of NUZYRA and to continue the development of any other product candidates. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates, as we have done with Allergan (who assigned its rights to Almirall) for sarecycline in connection with the treatment of acne and rosacea in the U.S., with Almirall for sarecycline in connection with the treatment of acne in in the greater China region and with Zai for omadacycline in connection with all human therapeutic and preventative uses other than biodefense in the Zai territory.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether or not we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the U.S., the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the patent position protecting the product candidate, the potential of competing products, the need to seek licenses or sub-licenses to third-party intellectual property and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies and whether collaboration on an alternative product could be more attractive than a collaboration with us. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, it may delay completion of development and potential commercialization of our products. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development, registration or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nFurther, even if we are able to enter into collaborations, we must be able to sustain a mutually beneficial working relationship with our collaborators in order to achieve the intended benefits of those collaborations. In the past, certain of our collaborators, including Novartis, have terminated their partnering relationships with us due to delays and uncertainties in connection with the FDA regulatory pathway for approval of omadacycline for the ABSSSI and CABP indications. This past history may affect our ability to attract and enter into collaboration arrangements with future partners or collaborators.\nWe are continuing to build our sales and distribution infrastructure. If we are unable to develop our sales, marketing and distribution capability on our own or through collaborations with marketing partners, we will not be successful in commercializing NUZYRA or any future product candidates to their full potential.\nWhile we have entered into an arrangement with a third party to provide a contract field sales force, we currently are building the sales force and distribution capabilities within our organization. We are in the process of establishing a sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to successfully commercialize NUZYRA, or to outsource this function to a third party. Both of these options can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, we may not be able to hire a sales force in the U.S. that is large enough or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we intend to target. Any failure or delay in the development of our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of NUZYRA.\nWith respect to our existing products and any future product candidates, we may choose to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or as an alternative to our own sales force and distribution systems. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other licensing arrangements, our product revenue and profitability may be lower than if we directly marketed or sold any approved products. In addition, any revenue we receive will depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of these third parties, which may not be successful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any approved products. If we are not successful in commercializing any approved products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer, and we may incur significant additional losses.\nWe have limited experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties.\nWe will need to commit significant time and financial and managerial resources to maintain and further develop our marketing and sales force to ensure they have the technical expertise required to address any challenges we may face with the commercialization of NUZYRA.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain and develop our commercialization capabilities include:\n\u2022\nan inability to retain an adequate number of effective commercial personnel in the medical markets we intend to target\u037e\n\u2022\nan inability to train sales personnel, who may have limited experience with our company or NUZYRA, to deliver a consistent message regarding NUZYRA and be effective in convincing physicians to prescribe NUZYRA\u037e\n\u2022\na lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u2022\nan inability to equip sales personnel with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them educate physicians and our healthcare providers regarding NUZYRA and its proper administration\u037e\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with maintaining and further developing an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u2022\ncomplications or barriers that inhibit our commercial team from reaching the appropriate audience to promote our product(s) because of the spread of the coronavirus or any outbreak of other contagious diseases, especially during the early phase of our commercial launch of NUZYRA.\nIf we are not successful in establishing and maintaining an effective sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing NUZYRA and our future product revenue will suffer, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing NUZYRA.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute NUZYRA to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to commercially distribute NUZYRA to patients. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse NUZYRA and to process and ship customer orders and have negotiated contracts with specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors to sell and distribute NUZYRA. The specialty pharmacies sell NUZYRA directly to patients and provide patient education and ongoing management. The specialty distributors sell NUZYRA to hospitals and other large buying institutions. We have also contracted with a third-party patient services hub to help us with some or all of the following: benefits investigation and reimbursement adjudication support, patient assistance programs and ongoing compliance support. This distribution network will require significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. In addition, failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue from NUZYRA. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of NUZYRA, as well as any future products we may commercialize, sales could be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nIn addition, the use of specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors and a third-party patient services hub involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will:\n\u2022\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using NUZYRA or serious adverse reactions, events and/or product complaints regarding NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nnot effectively sell or support NUZYRA, or communicate publicly concerning NUZYRA in a manner that is contrary to FDA rules and regulations;\n\u2022\nreduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell NUZYRA in the volumes and within the time frame we expect;\n\u2022\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nAny such events may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our results of operations and business. Additionally, the provision of patient support services, although fairly typical in the pharmaceutical industry, can be subject to challenge under fraud and abuse or FDA laws if not structured appropriately.\nIndependent clinical investigators and CROs that we engage to conduct our clinical trials may not devote sufficient time or attention to our and our partners\u2019 clinical trials or be able to repeat their past success.\nWe expect to depend on independent clinical investigators and CROs to participate in and conduct our clinical trials, including our ongoing PK studies for omadacycline in oral only CABP, and any PMRs with the FDA. There is a limited number of third-party service providers that specialize or have the expertise required to achieve our business objectives. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our or our partners\u2019 development programs. These investigators and CROs will not be our employees, and we will not be able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including time, that they devote to our product candidates and clinical trials. If independent investigators fail to devote sufficient resources to the development of our product candidates, or if their performance is substandard, it may delay or compromise the prospects for approval and commercialization of any product candidates that we and our partners develop. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. Further, the FDA requires that we and our partners comply with standards, commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices, for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial subjects are protected. Failure of clinical investigators or CROs to meet their obligations to us or comply with current Good Clinical Practices could adversely affect the clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business.\nIf NUZYRA or SEYSARA do not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, the medical community and third-party payors, our revenue generated from their sales will be limited.\nThe commercial success of NUZYRA and SEYSARA will depend upon their level of market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of NUZYRA and SEYSARA will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the product\u2019s FDA or foreign regulatory approved labeling;\n\u2022\nchanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications for any of our products;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the approved clinical indications for our products;\n\u2022\ndemonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u2022\nlack of significant adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nsales, marketing, reimbursement and distribution support;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental or private third-party payors, such as Medicare or managed care plans;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which government or third-party payors implement utilization management techniques, such as unreasonably high copayment formulary tiers, prior authorization or quantity limits for our product(s), or even refuse to provide coverage or adequate reimbursement for the products;\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe degree of cost-effectiveness and value of our products;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative therapies at similar or lower cost, including generics and over-the-counter products;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals, and third-party payors, including managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nwhether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a therapy for particular infections;\n\u2022\nwhether the product is designated under national treatment or formulary guidelines;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about our products or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration of our products; and\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims.\nAlthough we believe our clinical studies demonstrate that NUZYRA and SEYSARA represent clinically meaningful and efficacious options for patients and physicians, it is possible that as we receive data from additional clinical trials or in a post-market setting from physician and patient experiences with the commercial products that do not continue to support such interpretations. It is also possible that the FDA, physicians and third-party payors will not agree with our interpretation of our existing and future clinical trial data. If we are unable to demonstrate the value of NUZYRA and SEYSARA based on our data, our opportunity for these products to maintain premium pricing and be commercialized successfully would be adversely affected. If NUZYRA or SEYSARA do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and the medical community, we and our partners may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of NUZYRA, SEYSARA or any future product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nEven though NUZYRA and SEYSARA have been approved for marketing in the U.S., we or our partners may never obtain approval of or commercialize NUZYRA or SEYSARA outside of the U.S., which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn October 2018, the FDA approved NUZYRA in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with CABP and ABSSSI that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. We have global commercial rights to omadacycline, except that we have entered into a collaboration with Zai to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline in the Zai territory. In October 2018, the FDA also approved SEYSARA for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older. In the U.S. and the greater China region, Almirall has the exclusive rights to commercialize SEYSARA for the treatment of acne, whereas we retain all rights to sarecycline all other countries. In the future, we, or our partners, may seek to commercialize omadacycline or sarecycline in countries outside of the U.S. and the greater China region.\nIn order to market products outside of the U.S., we and our partners must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other jurisdictions regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve product testing and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the U.S.\nClinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. In addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries.\nRegulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions or any delay or setback in obtaining such approvals could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBacteria might develop resistance to NUZYRA, which would decrease the efficacy and commercial viability of NUZYRA.\nAntibiotic resistance is primarily caused by the genetic mutation of bacteria resulting from suboptimal exposure to antibiotics where the drug does not eradicate all of the bacteria. While antibiotics have been developed to treat many of the most common infections, the extent and duration of their use worldwide has resulted in new mutated strains of bacteria resistant to current treatments. NUZYRA has been developed to treat patients infected with drug-resistant bacteria. If physicians, rightly or wrongly, associate the resistance issues of older generations of tetracyclines with NUZYRA, physicians might not prescribe NUZYRA for treating a broad range of infections. In addition, bacteria might develop resistance to NUZYRA if such bacteria are improperly dosed or treated repeatedly with NUZYRA over multiple years, causing the efficacy of NUZYRA to decline, which would negatively affect our potential to generate revenue from NUZYRA.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs, our partners and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. In addition, our systems safeguard important confidential personal data regarding our subjects. If a computer failure were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further commercialization of NUZYRA and development of any future product candidates could be delayed.\nIf any product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or any of our collaborative partners, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products, including NUZYRA and SEYSARA.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the testing of our products in seriously ill patients and will face an even greater risk from sales of NUZYRA and SEYSARA. Product liability claims may be brought against us or our partners by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling any of our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for NUZYRA or SEYSARA;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical trial programs;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation costs;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or a change in the indications for which they may be used;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022\nthe inability of us or our partners to successfully commercialize our products.\nWith the approval of NUZYRA and SEYSARA for commercial sale, we are highly dependent upon consumer perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. We could be adversely affected if we are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. Also, because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from patients\u2019 use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate annually, with a per incident limit of $10.0 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product development and commercialization efforts. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash resources and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully commercialize NUZYRA or any future product candidates.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We are to a certain extent dependent on the members of our senior management team for our business success. The employment agreements with our senior management team can be terminated by us or them at any time, with notice. The departure of any of our executive officers could result in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we, as an organization, possesses and could cause significant delays, or outright failure, in the execution of our strategies, the successful commercialization of NUZYRA, and the development of any future product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, development and clinical personnel. We may not be able to attract or retain such qualified personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will impede significantly our development objectives and timelines, the success of our commercialization efforts, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOn March 15, 2019, Douglas Pag\u00e1n resigned from his position as our Chief Financial Officer. We have initiated a search to identify and recruit a new candidate for the role of Chief Financial Officer. However, we cannot guarantee that the transition to a new Chief Financial Officer will be successful or will not result in a negative impact to the Company. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, may cause uncertainty or a disruption to a business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in other key management and employees.\nWe depend on various consultants and advisors for the success and continuation of our development efforts.\nWe work extensively with various consultants and advisors, who provide advice and/or services in various business and development functions, including clinical development, operations and strategy, regulatory matters, legal and finance. The potential success of our drug development programs depends, in part, on continued successful collaborations with certain of these consultants and advisors. Our consultants and advisors are not our employees and may have commitments and obligations to other entities that may limit their availability to us. Typically, these advisors will not enter into non-compete agreements with us. If a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services. We do not know if we will be able to maintain such relationships or that such consultants and advisors will not enter into other arrangements with competitors, any of which could have a detrimental impact on our development objectives and our business.\nWe will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of February 28, 2020, we had 101 full-time employees. We expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations that may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of existing and additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to successfully commercialize NUZYRA, develop any future product candidates and compete effectively with others in our industry will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nOur and our partners\u2019 business may become subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally, in part due to a number of our suppliers and collaborative and clinical trial relationships being located outside of the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation or political instability, in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements for drug product pricing and reimbursement;\n\u2022\npotentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in compliance with non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in non-U.S. regulations and customs, tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u2022\nchanges in non-U.S. currency exchange rates and currency controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic environment;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by U.S. or non-U.S. governments;\n\u2022\nnegative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including differing labor relations;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires and pandemics such as the coronavirus.\nThese risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research and development involves the use of potentially hazardous materials and chemicals. Our operations may have produced hazardous waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by local, state and federal laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations and fire and building codes, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, use and storage of flammable agents and the handling of biohazardous materials. Although we have always maintained workers\u2019 compensation insurance as prescribed by the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\nOur employees, contractors, partners, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, contractors, partners, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, laws that require the reporting of financial information or data timely, completely or accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us resulting from this misconduct, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe enter into various contracts in the normal course of our business in which we indemnify the other party to the contract. In the event we have to perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically enter into academic, commercial, service, collaboration, licensing, consulting and other agreements that contain indemnification provisions. With respect to our academic and other research agreements, we typically indemnify the institution and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to the products, processes or services made, used, sold or performed pursuant to the agreements for which we have secured licenses, and from claims arising from our or our sub licensees\u2019 exercise of rights under the agreement. With respect to our commercial agreements, we indemnify our vendors from any third-party product liability claims that could result from the production, use or consumption of the product, as well as for alleged infringements of any patent or other intellectual property right by a third party. With respect to consultants, we indemnify them from claims arising from the good faith performance of their services.\nShould our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if we were denied insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we are relying on a collaborator to indemnify us and the collaborator is denied insurance coverage or does not have assets available to indemnify us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of former employers.\nCertain of our former employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we ourselves inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent us or a collaboration partner\u2019s ability to develop or commercialize certain potential products, which could severely harm the business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for products, our product candidates and related technology, our business could be materially harmed.\nIssued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by pharmaceutical companies. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not allow us to protect our inventions with patents to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Because patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in scientific literature lag behind actual discoveries, or may not be the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications, or\nmay not be the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in our patents or patent applications. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or maintain protection for certain inventions. If such inventions or related inventions are successfully patented by others, we may be required to obtain licenses under third-party patents to market our product candidates, as described in greater detail below. Therefore, enforceability and scope of our patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection from our pending patent applications, from those we may file in the future, or from those we may license from third parties. Moreover, even if we are able to obtain patent protection, such patent protection may be of insufficient scope to achieve our business objectives or may not survive legal or administrative challenges by competitors.\nOur strategy depends on our ability to identify and seek and obtain patent protection for our discoveries. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute successfully all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The issuance of a patent does not ensure that it is valid or enforceable, so even if we obtain patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented technology. Third parties may also seek to market generic versions of any approved products by submitting ANDAs to the FDA in which they claim that patents owned or licensed by us are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Alternatively, third parties may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend and/or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary information to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant problems and costs in protecting their proprietary information in these foreign countries. Outside of the U.S., patent protection must be sought in individual jurisdictions, further adding to the cost and uncertainty of obtaining adequate patent protection outside of the U.S. Accordingly, additional patents protecting our technology may not issue in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions, and any patents that do issue may not have claims of adequate scope to provide competitive advantage. Moreover, third parties may be able to successfully obtain claims and such claims may be broad. The allowance of broader claims may increase the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings, opposition proceedings and/or reexamination proceedings, the risk of infringement litigation and the vulnerability of the claims to challenge. On the other hand, the allowance of narrower claims does not eliminate the potential for adversarial proceedings and may fail to provide a competitive advantage. Our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage. Moreover, even after they have issued, our patents and any patent for which we have licensed or may license rights may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. If our patents are invalidated or otherwise limited or expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with our products which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. The following are examples of litigation and other adversarial proceedings or disputes that we could become a party to involving our patents or patents licensed to us:\n\u2022\nwe or our partners may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent rights;\n\u2022\nthird parties may initiate litigation or other proceedings seeking to invalidate patents owned by or licensed to us or to obtain a declaratory judgment that their product or technology does not infringe our patents or patents licensed to us;\n\u2022\nthird parties may initiate opposition or reexamination proceedings challenging the validity or scope of our patent rights, requiring us or our partners to participate in such proceedings to defend the validity and scope of our patents;\n\u2022\nthere may be a challenge or dispute regarding inventorship or ownership of patents currently identified as being owned by or licensed to us;\n\u2022\nthe USPTO may initiate an interference between patents or patent applications owned by or licensed to us and those of our competitors, requiring us or our collaborators to participate in an interference proceeding to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights; or\n\u2022\nthird parties may submit ANDAs to the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of our approved or future approved products prior to expiration of relevant patents owned by or licensed to us, requiring us to defend our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement.\nThese lawsuits and proceedings would be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our managerial and scientific personnel. A court or administrative body may decide that our patents are invalid or not infringed by a third party\u2019s product or activity or that the scope of certain issued claims must be further limited. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our own patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against these or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. An adverse outcome in a dispute involving inventorship or ownership of our patents could, for example, subject us to additional royalty obligations and expand the number of product candidates that are subject to the royalty and other obligations of our license agreement with Tufts.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to develop a platform that is similar to, or better than, ours in a way that is not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our products or product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to effectively protect our trade secrets;\n\u2022\nany patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may ultimately be found invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\nOur and our partners\u2019 success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale or import our products or impair our competitive position. Patent applications that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe, could be issued to third parties. In addition, to the extent that a third party develops new technology that covers our products or product candidates, we and our partners may be required to obtain licenses to that technology, which licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing product candidates using our technology. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we require may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our or our partners\u2019 failure to maintain a license to any technology that we require may also materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we would be exposed to a threat of litigation.\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property rights have become commonplace. The types of situations in which we may become a party to such litigation or proceedings include:\n\u2022\nwe or our partners may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties seeking to invalidate the patents held by those third parties or to obtain a judgment that our products or processes do not infringe those third parties\u2019 patents;\n\u2022\nif our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us, we or our collaborators may be required to participate in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights and potentially provide a third party with a dominant patent position;\n\u2022\nif third parties initiate litigation claiming that our processes, products or use of products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, we and our collaborators will need to defend against such proceedings;\n\u2022\nif third parties initiate litigation claiming that our brand names infringe their trademarks, we and our collaborators will need to defend against such proceedings; and\n\u2022\nif a license to necessary technology is terminated, the licensor may initiate litigation claiming that our processes or products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights and/or that we breached our obligations under the license agreement, and we and our collaborators would need to defend against such proceedings.\nThese lawsuits would be costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our managerial and scientific personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our collaborators to stop the activities covered by the patents. In that event, we or our partners may not have a viable alternative to the technology protected by the patent and may need to halt work on the affected product or product candidate. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages. An adverse outcome in any litigation or other proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties. We may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the U.S., proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, do not develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or has infringed patents declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market and be precluded from manufacturing or selling our products.\nThe cost of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and financial resources. There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with any litigation, including those involving intellectual property, which litigation and risks can be costly in of itself or create an environment making it challenging to raise additional capital.\nIf we or our partners fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are currently party to an intellectual property license agreement with Tufts. The license agreement imposes, and we expect that future license agreements may impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. For example, we are required to use our best efforts to effect introduction of licensed products under the agreement into the U.S. commercial market. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the license, Tufts may have the right to terminate the license agreement, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by the agreement, such as NUZYRA. Termination of the license agreement or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in us having to negotiate a new or reinstated license with less favorable terms. If Tufts were to terminate its license agreement with us for any reason, our business could be materially harmed. In the event that we are unable to maintain the Tufts license, we may lose the ability to exclude third parties from offering substantially identical products for sale and may even risk the threat of a patent infringement lawsuit from our former licensor based on our continued use of its intellectual property. Either of these events could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business.\nUnder our license agreement with Tufts, we are responsible for prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications, including payment of necessary government fees. In the event that any of the licensed patents or patent applications unintentionally lapse or are otherwise materially diminished in value, our relationship with Tufts could be harmed. This could result in termination of the license, loss of the rights to control prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications and/or liability to Tufts for any loss.\nIf we or our partners are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, know-how and confidential and proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, our policy is to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees and our personnel policies also provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and those third parties as to the rights in related inventions. To the extent that an individual who is not obligated to assign rights in intellectual property to us is rightfully an inventor of intellectual property, we may need to obtain an assignment or a license to that intellectual property from that individual. Such assignment or license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and the existence of our own trade secrets affords no protection against such independent discovery.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously or concurrently employed at research institutions and/or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or that patents and applications we have filed to protect inventions of these employees, even those related to one or more of our product candidates, are rightfully owned by their former or concurrent employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to the USPTO and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the USPTO and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we are responsible for the payment of patent fees for patent rights that we have licensed from other parties. If any licensor of these patents does not itself elect to make these payments, and we fail to do so, we may be liable to the licensor for any costs and consequences of any resulting loss of patent rights.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar foreign legislation by extending the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nBased on the FDA marketing approval of our products, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process, with the condition that this five year extension does not extend the patent for more than fourteen years from the approval date. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than our request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product may not extend beyond the current patent expiration dates and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nOur contract with BARDA may affect our intellectual property rights.\nOur contract with BARDA includes provisions that implement the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and grant the U.S. government certain rights in inventions that may be conceived or first actually reduced to practice under the contract. In particular, the U.S. government is granted a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up, worldwide license to practice such inventions or have such inventions practiced for or on the U.S. government's behalf. The U.S. government also has \"march-in\" rights with respect to such inventions, which allow the U.S. government to directly or require us, our assignee, or our exclusive licensee to license such inventions to a third party on an exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive basis if the U.S. government determines that such an action is necessary (i) because adequate steps have not been taken to achieve practical application of such an invention, (ii) to alleviate health or safety needs, (iii) to meet requirements for public use specified by federal regulations, or (iv) due to a violation of an agreement to manufacture substantially in the U.S. a product embodying such an invention or produced through the use of such an invention. Unless waived by the U.S. government, we are required to obtain such an agreement to manufacture substantially in the U.S. from another party to which we exclusively license such an invention. The U.S. government also has the right to take title to such inventions if we fail to disclose, elect title to, or pursue or maintain patent protection for such inventions within specified periods of time.\nRisks Related to the Notes\nServicing our debt, including the Notes, requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to regulatory, economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We are a biopharmaceutical company that has not yet generated profit from product sales. We expect to continue to incur losses as we add infrastructure and personnel to support our commercialization and product development efforts and operations. Accordingly, our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nThe Notes are subordinated to our senior indebtedness, effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness and structurally junior to any liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are our general, unsecured, senior subordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our future unsecured, senior subordinated indebtedness; senior to all of our future subordinated indebtedness; junior to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness, whether or not secured; effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness, including secured indebtedness under the Hercules Loan Agreement to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to the liabilities, including trade payables, of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets, and the assets of our subsidiaries will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after all claims senior to the Notes have been repaid in full. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding. The indenture governing the Notes does not prohibit us from incurring additional senior debt or secured debt, nor does it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. While the Hercules Loan Agreement restricts our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to issue or incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, if our loans under the Hercules Loan Agreement mature or are repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our existing or future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness that exist at the time of the repurchase. The Hercules Loan Agreement currently limits our ability to repurchase the Notes. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the Hercules Loan Agreement and/or agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes.\nIn addition, our borrowings under the Hercules Loan Agreement are, and are expected to continue to be, at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease.\nThe Hercules Loan Agreement limits our ability to pay any cash amount upon repurchase of the Notes.\nThe Hercules Loan Agreement prohibits us from making any cash payments to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Any new credit facility that we may enter into may have similar restrictions.\nOur failure to repurchase the Notes as required under the terms of the Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Notes and permit holders of the Notes to accelerate our obligations under the Notes. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the Hercules Loan Agreement or agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes.\nFuture sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon conversion of the Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or equity-linked securities, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nthe commercial performance of NUZYRA and SEYSARA;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and expand regulatory approval for NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nissues in manufacturing NUZYRA;\n\u2022\nthe results of our current and any future clinical trials of NUZYRA or any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key commercial partner agreements;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nannouncements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity relating to the antibiotics market, including with respect to other products and potential products in such market;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with our products;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results, including, in particular, our use of cash in operations.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe expect that we will retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 0.9 million shares of common stock are held by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates and are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock that are subject to outstanding options and restricted stock units as of December 31, 2019 will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBecause our merger resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code for Transcept, Transcept\u2019s pre-merger net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to limitations. The net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes of the former Paratek entity and us may also be subject to limitations as a result of ownership changes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 382, the corporation\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising from before the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. The Merger resulted in an ownership change for Transcept and, accordingly, Transcept\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to limitations on their use after the Merger. Old Paratek\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards may also be subject to limitation as a result of prior shifts in equity ownership and/or the Merger. Additional ownership changes in the future could result in additional limitations on Transcept\u2019s, Old Paratek\u2019s and our net operating loss carryforwards. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of Transcept\u2019s, Old Paratek\u2019s or our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, the trading price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business and our common stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had research coverage by seven securities analysts. If the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research regarding us or our business model, technology or stock performance, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our common stock to decline. Moreover, the unpredictability of our financial results likely reduces the certainty, and therefore reliability, of the forecasts by securities or industry analysts of our future financial results, adding to the potential volatility of the trading price of our common stock.\nMaintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and The Nasdaq Global Market rules. The requirements of these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including costs associated with the hiring of additional personnel, making some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place, as well as maintaining these controls and procedures, is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, requires that we annually evaluate our internal control over financial reporting to enable management to report on, and our independent auditors to audit as of the end of each fiscal year, the effectiveness of those controls. In connection with the Section 404 requirements, both we and our independent registered public accounting firm test our internal controls and could, as part of that documentation and testing, identify material weaknesses, significant deficiencies or other areas for further attention or improvement.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, require the hiring of additional finance, accounting and other personnel, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Moreover, adequate internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nVarious rules and regulations applicable to public companies make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent for purposes of The Nasdaq Global Market rules, will be significantly curtailed.", "PERMNO": 91279, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRTK"}
