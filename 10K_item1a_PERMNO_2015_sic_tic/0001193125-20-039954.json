RISK FACTORS\nYou\nshould carefully consider the following risk\nfactors in addition to the other information\nincluded in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese risk factors are not the only risks\nwe face.\nOur business could also be\naffected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently\nknown to us or that we currently consider to be\nimmaterial.\nIf any of these risks were to occur, our business, operating results and financial\ncondition, as well\nas the value of an investment in our common\nstock could be adversely affected.\nOur operating results, our future rate of growth\nand the carrying value of our assets are exposed\nto the\neffects of changing commodity prices.\nPrices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and\nLNG can fluctuate widely.\nBrent crude oil prices\naveraged $64 per barrel in 2019, ranging from\na low of $53 per barrel in January to a high of almost\n$75 per\nbarrel in April.\nGiven volatility in commodity price drivers\nand the worldwide political and economic\nenvironment generally, as well as increased uncertainty generated by recent (and\npotential future) armed\nhostilities in various oil-producing regions around the\nglobe, price trends may continue to be volatile.\nOur\nrevenues, operating results and future rate of growth\nare highly dependent on the prices\nwe receive for our\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and\nLNG.\nThe factors influencing these prices are\nbeyond our control.\nLower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGL and\nLNG prices may have a material adverse effect on our\nrevenues, operating income, cash flows and liquidity, and may also affect the amount\nof dividends we elect to\ndeclare and pay on our common stock and the\namount of shares we elect to acquire as\npart of the share\nrepurchase program and the timing of such acquisitions.\nLower prices may also limit the amount of reserves\nwe can produce economically, adversely affecting our proved reserves, reserve replacement\nratio and\naccelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels\nas we continue production from upstream\nfields.\nSignificant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, NGLs and LNG prices could also require\nus to reduce\nour capital expenditures, impair the carrying value\nof our assets or discontinue the classification\nof certain\nassets as proved reserves.\nIn the past three years, we recognized several\nimpairments, which are described in\nNote 9-Impairments and the \u201cAPLNG\u201d section\nof Note 6-Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf commodity prices remain low relative\nto their historic\nlevels, and as we continue to optimize our investments\nand exercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely\nwe will incur future impairments to long-lived assets\nused in operations, investments in nonconsolidated\nentities accounted for under the equity method and\nunproved properties.\nAlthough it is not reasonably\npracticable to quantify the impact of any future\nimpairments at this time, our results of operations\ncould be\nadversely affected as a result.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase\nshares is subject to certain considerations.\nDividends are authorized and determined by\nour Board of Directors in its sole discretion\nand depend upon a\nnumber of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nCash available for distribution.\n\u25cf\nOur results of operations and anticipated future\nresults of operations.\n\u25cf\nOur financial condition, especially in relation\nto the anticipated future capital needs of our\nproperties.\n\u25cf\nThe level of distributions paid by comparable companies.\n\u25cf\nOur operating expenses.\n\u25cf\nOther factors our Board of Directors deems\nrelevant.\nWe expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders; however, our Board of Directors may\nreduce our dividend or cease declaring dividends\nat any time, including if it determines that\nour net cash\nprovided by operating activities,\nafter deducting capital expenditures and investments,\nare not sufficient to pay\nour desired levels of dividends to our stockholders\nor to pay dividends to our stockholders at all.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2019, $5.4 billion of repurchase authority\nremained of the $15 billion share\nrepurchase program our Board of Directors had\nauthorized.\nIn February, 2020, our Board of Directors\napproved an increase to our repurchase authorization\nfrom $15 billion to $25 billion, to support\nour plan for\nfuture share repurchases.\nOur share repurchase program does not obligate\nus to acquire a specific number of\nshares during any period, and our decision to\ncommence, discontinue or resume repurchases\nin any period will\ndepend on the same factors that our Board of\nDirectors may consider when declaring dividends,\namong others.\nAny downward revision in the amount of dividends\nwe pay to stockholders or the number of shares\nwe\npurchase under our share repurchase program could\nhave an adverse effect on the market price of our common\nstock.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable\nterms.\nWe have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operations to fund\nour operations and\nstrategy; however, we have also relied from time to time on access to\nthe debt and equity capital markets for\nfunding.\nThere can be no assurance that additional debt\nor equity financing will be available in the future\non\nacceptable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, although we anticipate we\nwill be able to repay our existing\nindebtedness when it matures or in accordance\nwith our stated plans, there can be no assurance\nwe will be able\nto do so.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing, or\nrefinance our existing indebtedness when it matures\nor\nin accordance with our plans, will be subject to a\nnumber of factors, including market conditions,\nour operating\nperformance, investor sentiment and our ability\nto incur additional debt in compliance with agreements\ngoverning our then-outstanding debt.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient funds from\noperations or raise\nadditional capital for any reason, our business could\nbe adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major\nrating agencies based on a number of factors,\nincluding\nour financial strength and conditions affecting the oil\nand gas industry generally.\nWe and other industry\ncompanies have had their ratings reduced in the\npast due to negative commodity price outlooks.\nAny\ndowngrade in our credit rating or announcement\nthat our credit rating is under review for possible\ndowngrade\ncould increase the cost associated with any additional\nindebtedness we incur.\nOur business may be adversely affected by deterioration\nin the credit quality of, or defaults under our\ncontracts with, third parties with whom we do\nbusiness.\nThe operation of our business requires us to engage\nin transactions with numerous counterparties\noperating in a\nvariety of industries, including other companies\noperating in the oil and gas industry.\nThese counterparties\nmay default on their obligations to us as a result\nof operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other\nreasons, including bankruptcy.\nMarket speculation about the credit quality\nof these counterparties, or their\nability to continue performing on their existing obligations,\nmay also exacerbate any operational difficulties\nor\nliquidity issues they are experiencing, particularly\nas it relates to other companies in the oil and gas industry\nas\na result of the volatility in commodity prices.\nAny default by any of our counterparties may\nresult in our\ninability to perform our obligations under agreements\nwe have made with third parties or may otherwise\nadversely affect our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, our rights against any of our counterparties\nas a result of a default may not be adequate to\ncompensate us for the resulting harm caused\nor may not be\nenforceable at all in some circumstances.\nWe may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to\nenforce any rights we have against a defaulting\ncounterparty, which could further adversely impact our results\nof operations.\nIn particular, in August 2018, we entered into a settlement\nagreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.\n(PDVSA) providing for the payment of approximately\n$2 billion over a five-year period in connection\nwith an\narbitration award issued by the International\nChamber of Commerce (ICC) Tribunal in favor of ConocoPhillips\non a contractual dispute arising from Venezuela\u2019s expropriation of our interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca\nheavy oil ventures and other pre-expropriation\nfiscal measures.\nWe collected approximately $0.8 billion of the\n$2.0 billion settlement in 2018 and 2019.\nPDVSA has defaulted on its remaining payment\nobligations under\nthis agreement, we are therefore now forced to\nincur additional costs as we seek to recover any\nunpaid amounts\nunder the agreement.\nUnless we successfully add to our existing proved\nreserves, our future crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural gas and\nNGL production will decline, resulting in an\nadverse impact to our business.\nThe rate of production from upstream fields\ngenerally declines as reserves are depleted.\nIf we do not conduct\nsuccessful exploration and development activities,\nor, through engineering studies, optimize production\nperformance or identify additional or secondary\nrecovery reserves, our proved reserves\nwill decline materially\nas we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and\nNGLs, and our business will experience reduced cash\nflows\nand results of operations.\nAny cash conservation efforts we may undertake as a result\nof commodity price\ndeclines may further limit our ability to replace\ndepleted reserves.\nThe exploration and production of oil and gas\nis a highly competitive industry.\nThe exploration and production of crude oil,\nbitumen, natural gas and NGLs is a highly\ncompetitive business.\nWe compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the\nexploration and production\nbusiness, including to locate and obtain new\nsources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen,\nnatural gas and\nNGLs in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\nSome of our competitors are larger and have greater\nresources\nthan we do or may be willing to incur a higher\nlevel of risk than we are willing to incur to obtain\npotential\nsources of supply.\nIf we are not successful in our competition\nfor new reserves, our financial condition and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nAny material change in the factors and assumptions\nunderlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural\ngas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity\nand value of those reserves.\nOur proved reserve information included in this annual\nreport represents management\u2019s best estimates based\non assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes\nto be recovered from underground accumulations of\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs.\nSuch volumes cannot be directly measured\nand the estimates and\nunderlying assumptions used by management are\nsubject to substantial risk and uncertainty.\nAny material\nchanges in the factors and assumptions underlying\nour estimates of these items could result\nin a material\nnegative impact to the volume of reserves reported\nor could cause us to incur impairment expenses\non property\nassociated with the production of those reserves.\nFuture reserve revisions could also result\nfrom changes in,\namong other things, governmental regulation.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating\ncosts as a result of our\ncompliance with existing and future environmental\nlaws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to numerous laws and regulations\nrelating to the protection of the environment, which\nare expected to continue to have an increasing\nimpact on our operations in the U.S. and in other\ncountries in\nwhich we operate.\nFor a description of the most significant of these\nenvironmental laws and regulations, see\nthe \u201cContingencies-Environmental\u201d section\nof Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations.\nThese laws and regulations continue to increase\nin both number and\ncomplexity and affect our operations with respect to, among\nother things:\n\u25cf\nPermits required in connection with exploration,\ndrilling, production and other activities.The\ndischarge of pollutants into the environment.\n\u25cf\nEmissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen\noxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and GHG emissions.\n\u25cf\nCarbon taxes.\n\u25cf\nThe handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal\nand cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous\nand nonhazardous wastes.\n\u25cf\nThe dismantlement, abandonment and restoration\nof our properties and facilities at the\nend of their\nuseful lives.\n\u25cf\nExploration and production activities in\ncertain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields,\noil\nsands reservoirs and unconventional plays.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance,\nand remediation\nexpenditures as a result of these laws and regulations.\nAny failure by us to comply with existing\nor future\nlaws, regulations and other requirements could result\nin administrative or civil penalties, criminal\nfines, other\nenforcement actions or third-party litigation\nagainst us.\nTo the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are\nnot ultimately reflected in the prices of our products\nand services, our business, financial\ncondition, results of\noperations and cash flows in future periods could\nbe materially adversely affected.\nExisting and future laws, regulations and initiatives\nrelating to global climate change, such as limitations\non GHG emissions, may impact or limit\nour business plans, result in significant expenditures,\npromote\nalternative uses of energy or reduce demand\nfor our products.\nContinuing political and social attention to the\nissue of global climate change has resulted in\nboth existing and\npending international agreements and national,\nregional or local legislation and regulatory\nmeasures to limit\nGHG emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, carbon\ntaxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency\nstandards and incentives or mandates for renewable\nenergy.\nFor example, in December 2015, the U.S. joined\nthe international community at the 21st Conference\nof the Parties of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change in Paris that\nprepared an agreement requiring member countries\nto review and\nrepresent a progression in their intended GHG\nemission reduction goals every five years\nbeginning in 2020.\nWhile the U.S. announced its intention to withdraw\nfrom the Paris Agreement, there is no guarantee\nthat the\ncommitments made by the U.S. will not be implemented,\nin whole or in part, by U.S. state and local\ngovernments or by major corporations headquartered\nin the U.S.\nIn addition, our operations continue in\ncountries around the world which are party to,\nand have not announced an intent to\nwithdraw from, the Paris\nAgreement.\nThe implementation of current agreements and\nregulatory measures, as well as any future\nagreements or measures addressing climate\nchange and GHG emissions, may adversely\nimpact the demand for\nour products, impose taxes on our products or operations\nor require us to purchase emission credits\nor reduce\nemission of GHGs from our operations.\nAs a result, we may experience declines in commodity\nprices or incur\nsubstantial capital expenditures and compliance,\noperating, maintenance and remediation costs,\nany of which\nmay have an adverse effect on our business and results\nof operations.\nAdditionally, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in pressure\nupon shareholders,\nfinancial institutions and/or financial markets\nto modify their relationships with oil and gas companies\nand to\nlimit investments and/or funding to such companies,\nwhich could increase our costs or otherwise\nadversely\naffect our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, increasing attention to global climate\nchange has resulted in an increased likelihood of\ngovernmental investigations and private litigation,\nwhich could increase our costs or otherwise adversely\naffect\nour business.\nIn 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, and\na state government in California, New\nYork, Washington,\nRhode Island and Maryland, as well as the Pacific\nCoast Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Association, Inc., filed\nlawsuits against oil and gas companies, including\nConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages\nand\nequitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.\nConocoPhillips is vigorously defending against\nthese\nlawsuits.\nThe ultimate outcome and impact to us\ncannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur\nsubstantial legal costs associated with defending\nthese and similar lawsuits in the future.\nIn addition, although\nwe design and operate our business operations\nto accommodate expected climatic\nconditions, to the extent there are significant\nchanges in the earth\u2019s climate, such as more severe or frequent\nweather conditions in the markets where we operate\nor the areas where our assets reside, we could incur\nincreased expenses, our operations could be adversely\nimpacted, and demand for our products could\nfall.\nFor more information on legislation or precursors\nfor possible regulation relating to global climate\nchange that\naffect or could affect our operations and a description of the company\u2019s response, see the\n\u201cContingencies-\nClimate Change\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.\nDomestic and worldwide political and economic\ndevelopments could damage our operations and materially\nreduce our profitability and cash flows.\nActions of the U.S., state, local and foreign\ngovernments, through sanctions, tax and other\nlegislation,\nexecutive order and commercial restrictions,\ncould reduce our operating profitability both\nin the U.S. and\nabroad.\nIn certain locations, governments have imposed\nor proposed restrictions on our operations;\nspecial\ntaxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency\nregulations that could require us to disclose\ncompetitively\nsensitive information or might cause us to violate\nnon-disclosure laws of other countries.\nOne area subject to significant political\nand regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic\nfracturing, an essential\ncompletion technique that facilitates production\nof oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower\npermeability\nrock formations.\nA range of local, state, federal and national laws\nand regulations currently govern or, in some\nhydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic\nfracturing in some jurisdictions.\nAlthough hydraulic\nfracturing has been conducted for many decades,\na number of new laws, regulations and permitting\nrequirements are under consideration by the\nU.S. EPA and others which could result in increased costs,\noperating restrictions, operational delays or limit\nthe ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.\nCertain\njurisdictions in which we operate, including state\nand local governments in Colorado, have adopted\nor are\nconsidering regulations that could impose new\nor more stringent permitting, disclosure\nor other regulatory\nrequirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil\nand natural-gas operations, including subsurface\nwater\ndisposal.\nIn addition, certain interest groups have also\nproposed ballot initiatives and constitutional\namendments designed to restrict oil and natural-gas\ndevelopment generally and hydraulic fracturing\nin\nparticular.\nFor example, in 2018, Colorado voters rejected\nProposition 112, a Colorado ballot initiative that\nwould have drastically limited the use of hydraulic\nfracturing in Colorado.\nIn the event that ballot initiatives,\nlocal or state restrictions or prohibitions are\nadopted and result in more stringent limitations\non the production\nand development of oil and natural gas in areas\nwhere we conduct operations, we may incur significant\ncosts to\ncomply with such requirements or may experience\ndelays or curtailment in the permitting\nor pursuit of\nexploration, development or production activities.\nSuch compliance costs and delays, curtailments,\nlimitations\nor prohibitions could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial\ncondition and liquidity.\nThe U.S. government can also prevent or restrict\nus from doing business in foreign countries.\nThese\nrestrictions and those of foreign governments\nhave in the past limited our ability to\noperate in, or gain access\nto, opportunities in various countries.\nActions by host governments, such as the expropriation\nof our oil assets\nby the Venezuelan government, have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue to\ndo so in\nthe future.\nChanges in domestic and international regulations\nmay affect our ability to collect payments such\nas those pertaining to the settlement with PDVSA\nor the ICSID Award against the Government of Venezuela;\nor to obtain or maintain permits, including those\nnecessary for drilling and development of wells\nin various\nlocations.\nLocal political and economic factors in international\nmarkets could have a material adverse effect on us.\nApproximately 50 percent of our hydrocarbon\nproduction was derived from production outside\nthe U.S. in\n2019, and 39 percent of our proved reserves, as\nof December 31, 2019, were located outside\nthe U.S.\nWe are\nsubject to risks associated with operations in international\nmarkets, including changes in foreign governmental\npolicies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen,\nNGLs or LNG pricing and taxation, other\npolitical,\neconomic or diplomatic developments (including\nthe effect of international trade discussion and disputes),\nchanging political conditions and international\nmonetary and currency rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, some\ncountries where we operate lack a fully independent\njudiciary system.\nThis, coupled with changes in foreign\nlaw or policy, results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations to\nincreased risks, including\nincreased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those\njurisdictions and increased risks of adverse\nactions by\nlocal government authorities, such as expropriations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by price controls,\ngovernment-imposed limitations on production\nof\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs, or the\nunavailability of adequate gathering, processing,\ncompression, transportation, and pipeline\nfacilities and equipment for our production\nof crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural gas and NGLs.\nAs discussed above, our operations are subject\nto extensive governmental regulations.\nFrom time to time,\nregulatory agencies have imposed price controls\nand limitations on production by restricting\nthe rate of flow of\ncrude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL wells\nbelow actual production capacity.\nBecause legal requirements\nare frequently changed and subject to interpretation,\nwe cannot predict whether future restrictions\non our\nbusiness may be enacted or become applicable to\nus.\nOur ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen,\nnatural gas, NGLs and LNG that we produce\nalso\ndepends on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation\nand\npipeline facilities and equipment, as well as any necessary\ndiluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, NGLs and LNG for transport.\nThe facilities, equipment and diluents we rely\non may be temporarily\nunavailable to us due to market conditions, extreme\nweather events, regulatory reasons, mechanical\nreasons or\nother factors or conditions, many of which are\nbeyond our control.\nIn addition, in certain newer plays, the\ncapacity of necessary facilities, equipment and diluents\nmay not be sufficient to accommodate production\nfrom\nexisting and new wells, and construction and permitting\ndelays, permitting costs and regulatory or other\nconstraints could limit or delay the construction,\nmanufacture or other acquisition of new facilities\nand\nequipment.\nIf any facilities, equipment or diluents, or\nany of the transportation methods and channels\nthat we\nrely on become unavailable for any period of time,\nwe may incur increased costs to transport\nour crude oil,\nbitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG for sale or\nwe may be forced to curtail our production\nof crude oil,\nbitumen, natural gas or NGLs.\nOur investments in joint ventures decrease\nour ability to manage risk.\nWe conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share\ncontrol with our joint\nventure partners.\nThere is a risk our joint venture participants may\nat any time have economic, business or\nlegal interests or goals that are inconsistent with\nthose of the joint venture or us, or our joint\nventure partners\nmay be unable to meet their economic or other\nobligations and we may be required to\nfulfill those obligations\nalone.\nFailure by us, or an entity in which we have\na joint venture interest, to adequately manage\nthe risks\nassociated with any operations, acquisitions or\ndispositions could have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial condition or results of operations of our\njoint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully complete any disposition we elect to pursue.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to divest portions\nof our business or investments that\nare not important to our\nongoing strategic objectives.\nAny dispositions we undertake may involve numerous\nrisks and uncertainties,\nany of which could adversely affect our results of operations\nor financial condition.\nIn particular, we may not\nbe able to successfully complete any disposition\non a timeline or on terms acceptable\nto us, if at all, whether\ndue to market conditions, regulatory challenges\nor other concerns.\nIn addition, the reinvestment of capital\nfrom disposition proceeds may not ultimately\nyield investment returns in line with our internal\nor external\nexpectations.\nAny dispositions we pursue may also result in\ndisruption to other parts of our business,\nincluding through the diversion of resources\nand management attention from our ongoing\nbusiness and other\nstrategic matters, or through the disruption\nof relationships with our employees and key\nvendors.\nFurther, in\nconnection with any disposition, we may enter into\ntransition services agreements or undertake\nindemnity or\nother obligations that may result in additional\nexpenses for us.\nWe may also be required under applicable\naccounting rules to recognize impairments\nassociated with any disposition we pursue,\nwhether or not\ncompleted.\nAs part of our disposition strategy, on May 17, 2017, we completed the sale of\nour 50 percent nonoperated\ninterest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as the\nmajority of our western Canada gas assets\nto Cenovus Energy.\nConsideration for the transaction included 208\nmillion Cenovus Energy common shares.\nWe may not be able\nto liquidate the shares issued to us by Cenovus\nEnergy at prices we deem acceptable, or at all.\nOur operations present hazards and risks that\nrequire significant and continuous oversight.\nThe scope and nature of our operations present\na variety of significant hazards and risks, including\noperational\nhazards and risks such as explosions, fires,\ncrude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes,\narmed hostilities, terrorist attacks, sabotage, civil\nunrest or cyber attacks.\nOur operations may also be\nadversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving services\nor infrastructure required to\ndevelop, produce, process or transport our production,\nsuch as contract labor, drilling rigs, pipelines, railcars,\ntankers, barges or other infrastructure.\nOur operations are subject to the additional hazards\nof pollution,\nreleases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards\nand risks.\nOffshore activities may pose incrementally\ngreater risks because of complex subsurface\nconditions such as higher reservoir pressures,\nwater depths and\nmetocean conditions.\nAll such hazards could result in loss of human\nlife, significant property and equipment\ndamage, environmental pollution, impairment\nof operations, substantial losses to us and damage to\nour\nreputation.\nFurther, our business and operations may be disrupted if\nwe do not respond, or are perceived not to\nrespond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards\nand risks or any other major crisis or if\nwe are\nunable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational\ncomponents and capacity.\nOur technologies, systems and networks may be subject\nto cyber attacks.\nOur business, like others within the oil and gas\nindustry, has become increasingly dependent on digital\ntechnologies, some of which are managed by third-party\nservice providers on whom we rely to\nhelp us collect,\nhost or process information.\nAmong other activities, we rely on digital technology\nto estimate oil and gas\nreserves, process and record financial and operating\ndata, analyze seismic and drilling information\nand\ncommunicate with employees and third parties.\nAs a result, we face various cyber security\nthreats such as\nattempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control\nof, sensitive information about our operations\nand our\nemployees, attempts to render our data or systems\n(or those of third parties with whom we do\nbusiness)\ncorrupted or unusable, threats to the security\nof our facilities and infrastructure as well\nas those of third parties\nwith whom we do business and attempted cyber\nterrorism.\nIn addition, computers control oil and gas production,\nprocessing equipment and distribution\nsystems globally\nand are necessary to deliver our production to market.\nA disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these\noperating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure\non which they rely, many of which are not owned or\noperated by us, could damage critical production,\ndistribution or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery\nto\nmarkets or make it difficult or impossible to accurately\naccount for production and settle transactions.\nAlthough we have experienced occasional breaches\nof our cyber security, none of these breaches have had a\nmaterial effect on our business, operations or reputation.\nAs cyber attacks continue to evolve, we must\ncontinually expend additional resources to continue\nto modify or enhance our protective measures\nor to\ninvestigate and remediate any vulnerabilities\ndetected.\nOur implementation of various procedures\nand controls\nto monitor and mitigate security threats\nand to increase security for our information, facilities\nand\ninfrastructure may result in increased costs.\nDespite our ongoing investments in security\nresources, talent and\nbusiness practices, we are unable to assure that\nany security measures will be effective.\nIf our systems and infrastructure were to be breached,\ndamaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious\nnegative consequences, including disruption of\nour operations, damage to our reputation,\na loss of counterparty\ntrust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliance\ncosts, significant litigation exposure and legal\nliability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.\nAny of these could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough we have business continuity plans in\nplace, our\noperations may be adversely affected by significant and\nwidespread disruption to our systems and\ninfrastructure that support our business.\nWhile we continue to evolve and modify our\nbusiness continuity\nplans, there can be no assurance that they will\nbe effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts.\nFurther, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate\nus for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain\nadequate coverage may increase for us in the future.", "PERMNO": 13928, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "COP"}
