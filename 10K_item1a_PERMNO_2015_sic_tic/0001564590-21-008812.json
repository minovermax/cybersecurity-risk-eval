{"cik": "1683606", "company": "Cars.com Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully, together with all of the other information contained in this report, including \u201cSelected Financial Data,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes, when evaluating our business and any forward-looking statements or other statements we or our representatives make from time to time. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which statements are made. The risks and uncertainties described in this report are not the only ones we face. Other risks or uncertainties, which are not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial, also may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions have materially and adversely affected, and could continue to materially and adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the numerous measures implemented by governmental authorities around the country to contain the virus, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns (\u201crelated restrictions\u201d) have resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies and financial markets worldwide, and have caused significant volatility in U.S. and international debt and equity markets. While certain jurisdictions have relaxed or reversed some of these related restrictions, many have been subsequently reinstated, adding an additional layer of uncertainty.\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results have been, and will continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, including any additional resurgences of the pandemic. For example, the pandemic and related restrictions have caused a widespread increase in unemployment and have resulted in reduced consumer spending and an economic recession. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from subscription services offered to automotive dealers and our national advertising offerings to OEMs and other advertisers in or adjacent to the automotive industry and our business may be negatively affected during times of low automobile sales and high unemployment. To the extent that a weakened economy continues to impact our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to pay for our services or our vendors\u2019 ability to provide services to us, our operations, liquidity and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nNegative changes in the financial condition of dealers has resulted, and may continue to result in decreased subscription revenue and reduced demand for our services. Moreover, the impact of the pandemic and related restrictions on dealers may materially reduce our number of dealer customers in the future. Additionally, OEMs have reduced and may continue to reduce their advertising spend on our platforms due to the impact of the pandemic and related restrictions on the automotive industry. All of these factors could adversely impact our profitability and financial results.\nWith respect to managing our expenses, primarily in the second quarter of 2020, we implemented multiple initiatives to adjust our expenses in response to changes in revenue. These steps included: an employee furlough, reduction in force, temporary salary reductions, freezes on hiring and temporary labor, deferral of merit and promotion increases, a reduction of our marketing expense, while carefully maintaining consumer engagement as evidenced by our strong organic traffic, partnering with vendors to reduce cost, and significant reductions of non-essential spending. While we have restored certain expense reducing initiatives, we cannot accurately predict how these measures will affect the productivity of our workforce, consumer traffic to our websites or other operations. We may be required to reimplement or implement additional expense-reduction measures or amend our debt instruments in the future if the pandemic and related restrictions continue to persist, which could further adversely impact our operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, any additional resurgence or COVID-19 variants, actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, the ability to effectively and widely manufacture and distribute vaccines and broad acceptance of the vaccine by the general population, the availability and cost to access the capital markets, the effect on our dealer customers\u2019 demand for and ability to pay for our services, the effect on consumer demand for our services, disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel and impacts on employee health and responses to it.\nWe are subject to certain financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, as amended, and the indenture governing the Notes (as defined below). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions may affect our ability to comply with such covenants. We have taken steps to strengthen our financial position during this period of heightened uncertainty. In October 2020, we sold $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2028 (\u201cNotes\u201d) and used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay $235.0 million of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, repay $162.8 million of borrowings under our Term Loan and pay fees associated with the offering of the Notes. Simultaneously, we amended our existing credit facility to, among other things, refinance the credit facility and provide for a $230.0 million undrawn Revolving Credit Facility and a $200.0 million Term Loan, extend the maturity date of the credit facility until May 31, 2025, update and modify certain covenants, modify pricing and eliminate certain requirements previously in effect. We may further seek to amend the Credit Agreement to provide greater comfort that we will be able to remain in compliance with our obligations, but we may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable or to the extent necessary to avoid a default, depending upon conditions in the credit markets, the length and depth of the market reaction to the pandemic and our ability to compete in this environment. We may also seek to raise funds through debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations, significant investments or acquisitions that are consistent with our strategy. Due to the risks created by the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, the conditions of the capital markets may be more volatile and uncertain. If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. For information related to debt, see Note 8 (Debt) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions and may take further actions that alter our business operations, as may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential lasting effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our OEM and dealer customers, suppliers or vendors, consumers or on our financial results. However, we believe our marketplace, advertising and digital solutions were critical in helping our customers navigate the challenges of the pandemic and related restrictions through December 31, 2020. We believe our solutions will continue to be important tools to our customers in the future and, in particular, any potential future impacts of the pandemic and related restrictions. The impact of the pandemic and related restrictions may also heighten other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe participate in a highly competitive market, and pressure from existing and new competitors may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face significant competition from companies that provide listings, information, lead generation, websites, marketing and car-buying services designed to reach consumers and enable dealers to reach these consumers. Our competitors offer various products and services that compete with us including:\n\u2022\nInternet search engines and online automotive sites, such as Google, Facebook, Craigslist, AutoTrader.com, eBay Motors, CARFAX, Edmunds.com, KBB.com, CarGurus.com and TrueCar.com\n\u2022\nSites operated by automobile sellers (traditional and digital) and by OEMs\n\u2022\nProviders of offline, membership-based car-buying services, such as the Costco Auto Program\n\u2022\nWebsite platform and solution providers, such as Dealer.com, Sincro (formerly CDK Global) and DealerOn; and\n\u2022\nDigital advertising providers.\nWe compete with many of the above-mentioned companies and other companies for a share of a car dealer\u2019s overall marketing budget. To the extent that car dealers view alternative marketing and media strategies to be superior, we may not be able to maintain or grow the number of dealers in our network. In addition, new competitors may enter the online automotive retail industry with competing products and services.\nOur competitors could significantly impede our ability to expand our network of dealers and to reach consumers. Our competitors may also develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. In addition, if competitors develop products or services with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, we may need to decrease prices for our solutions to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing structure due to competitive pressures, our revenue may be reduced and our operating results may be negatively affected.\nSome of our larger competitors may be better able to respond more quickly with new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. In addition, to the extent that any of our competitors have existing relationships with dealers or OEMs for marketing or data analytics solutions, those dealers and automobile manufacturers may be unwilling to partner or continue to partner with us.\nIn addition, if any of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future third-party data providers, technology partners, or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve and promote our solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe compete with other consumer automotive websites and mobile applications and other digital content providers for share of automotive-related digital display advertising spending and may be unable to maintain or grow our base of advertising customers or increase our revenue from existing advertisers.\nAlthough the shift in advertising spending away from traditional advertising methods to digital advertising methods provides greater opportunity for us, competition to capture share of the total digital automotive advertising spend has increased and may continue to increase due to the attractive projected growth of digital automotive advertising spend and low barriers to entry in the online automotive classifieds and related digital automotive advertising markets.\nWe may face significant challenges in convincing our advertising customers, including national advertisers and OEMs, to expand their advertising on our sites and mobile applications in the face of growing competition, which could hurt our ability to grow our third-party advertising revenue. For example, there are a limited number of OEMs, most of which already advertise on our sites. To grow our advertising revenue from these OEMs, we may need to increase the portion of the OEMs\u2019 digital advertising budgets that we currently receive. In addition, if we experience a significant decrease in advertising spending by OEMs or other national advertisers for any reason, our revenue will decrease and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our strong brand recognition, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brands could hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of consumers, dealers and advertisers, and our ability to increase the frequency with which consumers, dealers and advertisers use our services.\nWe believe that maintaining and increasing the strong recognition of the CARS brands is critical to our future success. Our brand drives traffic to our websites and applications. Our brand is known for attracting a large base of in-market car shoppers by offering credible and easy-to-understand information from consumers and experts and an unrivaled set of new and used vehicle listings for consumers to view. In addition, OEMs, dealers and other advertisers rely on our innovative digital marketing services to drive results in their businesses. To grow our business, we must maintain, protect and enhance our brands. Otherwise, we may be unable to expand our base of consumers, customers and advertisers, or increase the frequency with which such constituents use or purchase our services. Expanding the business will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain the trust that consumers, customers and advertisers place in our services and the quality and integrity of the listings and other content found on the CARS sites and mobile applications. In addition, any negative publicity about us, including about our solutions, technologies, sales practices, personnel or customer service, could diminish confidence in and the use of our services. If we experience persistent negative publicity, or if consumers otherwise perceive that content on the CARS sites or mobile applications is not reliable, our reputation, the value of our brands and traffic to our sites and mobile applications could decline.\nWe rely in part on Internet search engines and mobile application stores to drive traffic to the CARS sites and increase downloads of our mobile applications. If the CARS sites and mobile applications fail to appear prominently in these search results, traffic to the CARS sites and mobile applications would decline and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend, in part, on Internet search engines such as Google to drive traffic to the CARS sites. For example, when a user searches for the make and model of a specific automobile or a generic phrase, such as \u201cautomobile prices,\u201d using an Internet search engine, we rely on a high organic search ranking of the CARS sites in these search results to drive consumer traffic. However, our ability to maintain these high search result rankings is not fully within our control. For example, our competitors\u2019 search engine optimization efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than us, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. In addition, Internet search engines could provide automobile dealer and pricing information directly in search results or choose to align with our competitors or develop competing services. The CARS sites have experienced both positive and negative fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and it is anticipated that similar fluctuations will occur in the future.\nAdditionally, we depend in part on mobile application download stores such as the Apple App Store and Google Play to direct consumers to download CARS\u2019 mobile applications. When a mobile device user searches in a mobile application store for \u201ccar buying app\u201d or a similar phrase, we rely on both a high search ranking and consumer brand awareness to drive consumers to select and download CARS\u2019 mobile applications instead of those of our competitors. However, our ability to maintain high, non-paid search result rankings in mobile application stores is not fully within our control. Our competitors\u2019 mobile application store search optimization efforts may result in their mobile applications receiving a higher result ranking than that of Cars.com, or mobile application download stores could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings.\nIf Internet search engines or mobile application download stores modify their search algorithms in ways that negatively impact traffic to the CARS sites or CARS mobile apps, or if the search engine or mobile application store optimization efforts of our competitors are more successful than our own efforts, overall growth in our user base could slow or the user base could decline.\nIf we fail to maintain or increase our base of subscribing dealers that purchase our solutions or to increase our revenue from subscribing dealers, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur revenue model generally employs subscription fee packages with the opportunity for dealer customers to purchase product enhancements or short-term premium services. Our ability to increase revenue from currently subscribing dealers depends, in part, on the ability of our sales team to demonstrate the value and benefits of the additional features of our product enhancements and short-term premium services to our subscribing dealers and to persuade them to purchase the higher-priced enhancements and services. Subscribing dealers do not have long-term obligations to purchase or renew subscriptions or product enhancements and premium services. Consequently, if subscribing dealers do not renew their subscriptions or continue to purchase product enhancements and premium services, or if we experience significant attrition of subscribing dealers or are unable to attract new dealers in numbers greater than the number of subscribing dealers that we lose, our revenue will decrease and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may face difficulties in developing new solution offerings as a full-service solutions provider that help automotive brands and dealers create enduring customer relationships.\nWe continue to expand the nature and scope of our offerings to our customers and have expanded our service offerings to incorporate digital solutions that use social, mobile and web-based technologies. Our ability to effectively offer a wide breadth of business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to our new service offerings. The market for solutions is highly competitive. We cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract clients to these service offerings. The inherent difficulty of developing or implementing new service offerings and significant competition in the markets for these services may affect our ability to market these services successfully.\nOur growth strategy will also increase demands on our management, operational and financial information systems and other resources. To accommodate our growth, we will need to continue to implement operational and financial information systems and controls, and expand, train, manage and motivate our employees. Our personnel, information systems, procedures or controls may not adequately support our growth strategy or our operations in the future. Failure to retain strong management, implement operational and financial information systems and controls, or expand, train, manage or motivate our workforce, could lead to delays in developing and achieving expected operating results for these new offerings.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to successfully develop and launch new products or grow our complementary product offerings.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to enhance and improve the value of our products and services through the development of new products and services and new value-added features for existing products and services, as well as our ability to leverage our brand recognition and existing operations to enter into new complementary markets successfully. Historically, we have been successful in increasing revenue through the launch of new products, services and value-added features and in entering complementary markets through the launch of new products and services. However, such historical success does not assure that we will continue to be successful in developing or introducing new products, services and value-added features, or that these new products, services and features will achieve market acceptance, enhance the value of our brand or permit us to enter new, complementary markets successfully. Further, the development of new products and services in response to evolving customer demands and competitive pressures requires significant time and resources and there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be effective in permitting us to maintain or grow our market share or to enter new markets in a cost-effective manner, or at all.\nThe value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. Our brand, reputation and ability to attract consumers and advertisers depend on the reliability of our technology platforms and the ability to\ncontinuously deliver content. Interruptions in our information technology systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or digital break-ins, capacity constraints, power outages, local or widespread Internet outages, telecommunication breakdowns or other uncontrollable events, could affect the security or availability of products on our sites or our mobile applications or prevent or inhibit the ability of consumers to access our marketplace, websites or other products. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, decreased use of our sites or mobile applications and loss of traffic, customers and revenue. Moreover, we continually upgrade and enhance our technology. The failure to complete an upgrade or enhancement as planned, or an unexpected result of a technology upgrade, could affect the security or availability of our products and services and could lead to loss of traffic, customers and revenue.\nAs we complete our Technology Transformation, as defined in Part II, Item 7., Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations our business may be negatively impacted in areas such as SEO traffic, user engagement and experience, such as outdated URLs and site performance.\nOur business is dependent on keeping pace with advances in technology. If we are unable to keep pace with advances in technology, consumers may stop using our services and our revenue may decrease.\nThe Internet and electronic commerce are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements and expectations, frequent new service and product introductions embodying new technologies, including mobile applications, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing sites, mobile applications and technology obsolete. These market characteristics are intensified by the emerging nature of the market and the fact that many companies are expected to introduce new Internet products and services in the near future. If we are unable to adapt to changing technologies, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on technology systems\u2019 availability and ability to prevent unauthorized access. If our security and resiliency measures fail to prevent incidents, it could result in damage to our reputation, incur costs and create liabilities.\nLike other technology-based businesses, our solutions may be subject to attacks from computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, unauthorized use, attempts to overload services with denial-of-service and other attacks. Any attack or disruption could negatively impact our ability to attract new consumers, dealers or advertisers and could deter current consumers, dealers or advertisers from using our solutions, or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability.\n\u2022\nAvailability: We rely on technology systems\u2019 availability to deliver services to consumers, dealers, OEMs, employees and partners. If we experience a disruption that results in performance or availability degradation, up to and including the complete shutdown of our sites or mobile applications, revenue could be impacted and consumers, dealers or advertisers may lose trust and confidence in us, decrease their use of our solutions or stop using our solutions entirely.\n\u2022\nData Protection (Consumers/Dealers/OEMs): We collect, process, store, share, disclose and use limited personal information and other data provided by consumers, dealers and OEMs, and sometimes that data includes names, addresses and certain location information used in geo-fencing. Failure to protect customer data or to provide customers with appropriate notice of our privacy practices, could subject us to liabilities imposed by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies or courts. In addition, we could be subject to evolving laws and regulatory standards that impose data use obligations, data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, restrictions on solicitation or other consumer privacy-related requirements.\n\u2022\nData Protection (Internal): We develop, create and acquire internal information that may be considered sensitive or valuable intellectual property in the normal operations of human resources, finance, legal, marketing, software development, product management, mergers and acquisitions and other business functions. Failure to protect sensitive internal information or intellectual property may result in loss of competitive advantage, reputation damage, direct and indirect costs and other liabilities. Failure to protect material financial information including financial performance and merger and acquisition data could also subject us to liabilities imposed by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies or courts.\nWe rely on, among other security measures, firewalls, anti-malware, intrusion prevention systems, distributed denial-of-service mitigation services, web content filtering, encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. We also depend on the security of our networks and partially on the security of our third-party service providers.\nAlthough we believe that our resiliency planning and security controls are appropriate to our exposures to system outages, service interruptions, security incidents and breaches, there is no guarantee that these plans and controls will prevent all such incidents. Techniques used to disable or degrade service or gain unauthorized access to systems or data change frequently and may not be recognized until damage is detected. We maintain cyber risk insurance but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future disruption, security incident or breach.\nMarket acceptance of and influence over certain of our products and services is concentrated with a limited number of automobile OEMs and dealership associations, and we may not be able to maintain or grow these relationships.\nAlthough the automotive retail industry is fragmented, a relatively small number of OEMs, dealership associations, and their program administrators exert significant influence over the market acceptance of certain automotive products and services due to their concentrated purchasing activity, their endorsement or recommendation of specific products and services, their provision co-operative advertising money to dealers, and/or their ability to define technical standards and certifications or marketing guidelines. For example, many of our website solutions are provided pursuant to OEM-designated endorsements or preferred vendor programs. While automotive dealers are generally free to purchase the solutions of their choosing, if an OEM has endorsed or certified a provider of products or services to its associated franchised dealers and if our solutions lack such certification or endorsement, adoption or retention of our products and services could be materially impaired.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business, including inventory information and sales of our product through social media and interruptions in the services or data they provide or any failure to maintain these relationships could harm our business.\nOur business relies on the collection, use and analysis of third-party data, including large amounts of inventory, vehicle and consumer information, and integrations with third-party systems, such as inventory management systems, customer relationship management systems and dealer management systems, for the benefit of our car buying consumers, dealer customers and advertisers. We use information about automobiles, inventory, ownership history and pricing from third parties, including OEMs, dealers and others, in various aspects of our business. We also partner with social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, to leverage our valuable audience data to serve native advertisements and display real-time inventory for both dealers and OEMs to in-market car shoppers. If the third parties on which we depend are unable or unwilling to provide data or services, restrict our use of data, experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, or revoke or fail to renew our licenses or partnerships, we could have difficulty operating key aspects of our business. In addition, if these third-party service providers were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption or increase their fees, or if our relationship with these providers were to deteriorate, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide our products to consumers and dealer customers until an equivalent provider could be found or until we develop replacement technology or operations.\nWe rely on in-house content creation and development to drive organic traffic to the CARS sites and mobile applications.\nWe rely on our in-house editorial content team to continually develop content of use and interest to consumers in order to drive organic traffic to the CARS sites and mobile applications. Our editorial content team tests, reviews and photographs a large number of different car makes and models every year to facilitate our creation of independent and unbiased coverage of the automotive landscape. Our internally developed content focuses primarily on consumer purchasing and ownership advice and analysis of consumer automotive purchasing and ownership trends. If we are unable to continue to develop our in-house content, we may be required to rely more heavily on third-party content providers, which would lead to less distinctive content on our sites and increased operating costs including increased traffic acquisition costs. Additionally, if we are unable to continue providing the same level of high-quality, unique consumer content, organic traffic across the CARS sites and mobile applications could decrease. Such a decrease may lead to dealers receiving fewer indications of consumer interest through leads generated by the CARS sites and mobile applications, and recognizing less value for their digital advertising spend. As a result, dealers may not continue to list their vehicles on the CARS sites and mobile applications. Similarly, decreased organic traffic due to a failure to continue developing unique content in-house may cause national advertisers such as OEMs to shift their digital advertising spend to sites with higher traffic. Further, decreased traffic from in-house content could result in increased spend in paid channels, which would result in higher sales and marketing expense. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to attract and retain dealer customers depends on our ability to collect and use data and develop tools to enable us to effectively deliver and accurately measure advertisements on our platform.\nMost dealer customers rely on tools that measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns in order to allocate their advertising spend among various formats and platforms. If we are unable to measure the effectiveness of advertising on our platform or we are unable to convince dealer customers that our platform should be part of a larger advertising budget, our ability to increase the demand and pricing of our advertising products and maintain or scale our revenue may be limited. Our tools may be less developed than those of other platforms with which we compete for advertising spend. Therefore, our ability to develop and offer tools that accurately measure the effectiveness of a campaign on our platform is critical to our ability to attract new dealer customers and retain, and increase spend from our existing dealer customers.\nWe are continually developing and improving these tools and such efforts have required and are likely to continue to require significant time and resources and additional investment, and in some cases we have relied on and may in the future rely on third parties to provide data and technology needed to provide certain measurement data to our dealer customers. If we cannot continue to\ndevelop and improve our advertising tools in a timely fashion, those tools are not reliable, or the measurement results are inconsistent with advertiser goals, our advertising revenue could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, web and mobile browser developers, such as Apple, Microsoft or Google, have implemented and may continue to implement changes that include requiring additional user permissions, in their browser or device operating system that impair our ability to measure and improve the effectiveness of advertising on our platform. Such changes include, limiting the use of first-party and third-party cookies and related tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising identifiers, and other changes that limit our ability to collect information which allows us to attribute user actions on dealer customers\u2019 websites to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns that are run on our platform. For example, Apple launched its Intelligent Tracking Prevention (\u201cITP\u201d) feature in its Safari browser. ITP blocks some or all third-party cookies by default on mobile and desktop and ITP has become increasingly restrictive over time. Apple's related Privacy-Preserving Ad Click attribution (PPAC), intended to preserve some of the functionality lost with ITP, would limit cross-site and cross-device attribution, prevent measurement outside a narrowly-defined attribution window, and prevent ad re-targeting and optimization. Similarly, Google recently announced that it plans to stop supporting third-party cookies in its Google Chrome browser. Further, Apple announced certain changes, including introducing an AppTrackingTransparency framework that will limit the ability of mobile applications to request an iOS device\u2019s advertising identifier and may also affect our ability to track user actions off our platform and connect their interactions with on-platform advertising.\nIn addition, third parties, such as Apple, Microsoft or Google, have implemented and may continue to implement changes and restrictions in browser or device functionality that limit the use of cookies, or that limit our ability to communicate with or understand the identity of our consumers.\nThese restrictions make it more difficult for us to provide the most relevant ads to our consumers, measure the effectiveness of and re-target and optimize advertising on our platform. Developers may release additional technology that further inhibits our ability to collect data that allows us to measure the effectiveness of advertising on our platform. Any other restriction, whether by law, regulation, policy (including third-party policies) or otherwise, on our ability to collect and share data which our dealer customers find useful, our ability to use or benefit from tracking and measurement technologies, including cookies, or that further reduce our ability to measure the effectiveness of advertising on our platform would impede our ability to attract, grow and retain dealer customers. Dealer customers and other third parties who provide data that helps us deliver personalized, relevant advertising may restrict or stop sharing this data. If they stop sharing this data with us, it may not be possible for us to collect this data within the product or from another source.\nWe rely heavily on our ability to collect and share data and metrics for our dealer customers to help new and existing dealer customers understand the performance of advertising campaigns. If dealer customers do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations of our user base and user engagement or if we discover inaccuracies in our metrics, they may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our platform, which could harm our business, revenue and financial results.\nWe rely on third-party services to track and calculate certain of our key metrics, including unique visitors and traffic and any errors or interruptions in the services or data they provide or any failure to maintain these relationships could harm our business.\nCertain of our key metrics - the number of our unique visitors and our traffic - are measured with third-party tools. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable periods of measurement, measurement methodologies exhibit a level of accuracy risk because of a variety of factors. For example, we have discovered in the past, and expect to discover in the future, that portions of our traffic, have been attributable to non-human traffic. Because this non-human traffic generally exhibits detectable anomalous patterns, our reported traffic metrics for impacted periods reflects an adjustment to remove non-human traffic. We expect to continue to make similar adjustments in the future if we determine that our traffic metrics are materially impacted by invalid traffic.\nThere are also inherent challenges in measuring usage across our large user base. For example, because these metrics are based on users with unique cookies, an individual who accesses our website from multiple devices with different cookies may be counted as multiple unique visitors, and multiple individuals who access our website from a shared device with a single cookie may be counted as a single unique visitor. In addition, although we use technology designed to block low quality traffic, we may not be able to prevent all such traffic, and such technology may have the effect of blocking some valid traffic. For these and other reasons, our traffic and unique visitor metrics may not accurately reflect the number of people actually using our platform.\nOur measures of traffic and other key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties (other than those whose data we use to calculate our key metrics) or from similar metrics of our competitors. We continually seek to improve our ability to measure these key metrics, and regularly review our processes to assess potential improvements to their accuracy. However, the improvement of our tools and methodologies could cause inconsistency between current data and previously reported data.\nAdditionally, as both the industry in which we operate and our business continue to evolve, so too might the metrics by which we evaluate our business. We may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine such metrics are no longer accurate or appropriate measures of our performance. If our audience, customers and stockholders do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, our reputation may be harmed.\nOur business is subject to risks related to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand and other macroeconomic issues.\nDecreases in consumer demand could adversely affect the market for automobile purchases and, as a result, reduce the number of consumers using our platform. Consumer purchases of new and used automobiles generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. Purchases of new and used automobiles are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy, including increases in the cost of energy and gasoline, the availability and cost of credit, reductions in business and consumer confidence, stock market volatility, health or similar issues, such as pandemic or epidemic, and increased unemployment. In addition, the use of ride sharing and the development of autonomous vehicles could erode the demand for new and used automobiles. A reduction in the number of automobiles purchased by consumers could adversely affect automobile dealers and car manufacturers and lead to a reduction in other spending by these constituents. Though our current customer bases, revenue sources and operations are substantially limited to the United States, our business may be negatively affected by challenges to the global automotive ecosystem and other macroeconomic issues.\nIf growth in the digital automotive advertising market or automotive digital solutions market stagnates or declines, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that future growth in the digital automotive advertising market will be driven, in part, by dealers and brand advertisers increasingly shifting their advertising spending away from traditional media such as newspapers, radio and television, and toward digital advertising. To the extent that overall automotive adjacent advertising does not continue to shift online or to mobile applications, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nDealer closures or consolidation among dealers or OEMs could reduce demand for, and the pricing of, our marketing and solutions offerings, thereby leading to decreased earnings.\nWhen dealers consolidate, the services they previously purchased separately are often purchased by the combined entity in a lesser quantity than before, leading to volume compression and loss of revenue across the automotive marketplace sector. In the past, dealers have been more likely to close or consolidate when general economic conditions and/or conditions in the automotive industry are poor. Despite our market position, consolidation or closures of automobile dealers could reduce the aggregate demand for our services in the future and limit the amounts we earn from our solutions. In addition, advertising purchased by OEMs accounts for a meaningful portion of our revenue. There are a limited number of OEMs, and financial difficulties or consolidation among OEMs could similarly lead to volume compression and loss of revenue.\nUncertainty exists in the application and interpretation of various laws and regulations related to our business, including privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the upcoming California Privacy Rights Act. New privacy concerns or laws or regulations applicable to our business, or the expansion or interpretation of existing laws and regulations that apply to our business, could reduce the effectiveness of our offerings or subject us to use restrictions, licensing requirements, claims, judgments and remedies including sales and use taxes, other monetary liabilities and limitations on our business practices, and could increase administrative costs.\nWe operate in a regulatory climate in which there is uncertainty as to the applicability of various laws and regulations related to our business. Our business could be significantly affected by different interpretations or applications of existing laws or regulations, future laws or regulations, including changes to the corporate tax rate or actions or rulings by judicial or regulatory authorities. Our operations may be subject to adoption, expansion or interpretation of various laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain licenses at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial and annual expense. Similarly, state tax authorities could take aggressive positions as to whether certain of our products are subject to sales and use taxes, leading to increased tax exposure. These additional expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future results of operations, whether directly through increasing future overhead or indirectly by forcing us to pass on these additional costs to our customers, making our solutions less competitive. There can be no assurances that future laws or regulations or interpretations or expansions of existing laws or regulations will not impose requirements on Internet commerce that could substantially impair the growth of e-commerce and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. The adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the efficacy of our offerings, restrict our present business practices, require us to implement costly compliance procedures or expose us and/or our customers to potential liability.\nWe may be considered to \u201coperate\u201d or \u201cdo business\u201d in states where our customers conduct their businesses, resulting in possible regulatory action. If any state licensing laws were determined to be applicable to us and if we are required to be licensed and are unable to do so, or are otherwise unable to comply with laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines or other penalties or be compelled to discontinue operations in those states. If any state\u2019s regulatory requirements impose state-specific requirements on us or include us within an industry-specific regulatory scheme, we may be required to modify our marketing programs in that state in a manner that may undermine such program\u2019s attractiveness to consumers, customers or advertisers. Alternatively, if we determine that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate operations in that state.\nAll states comprehensively regulate vehicle sales and lease transactions and include, strict licensure requirements for dealers (and, in some states, brokers) and vehicle advertising. We believe that most of these laws and regulations specifically apply only to traditional vehicle purchase and lease transactions, not Internet-based lead referral programs like ours. If we determine that the licensing or other regulatory requirements in a given state are applicable to us or to a particular marketing services program, we may elect to obtain the required licenses and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. However, if licensing or other regulatory requirements are overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate operations or particular marketing services programs in that state or elect to not introduce particular marketing services programs in that state. As we introduce new services, we may need to incur additional costs associated with additional licensing regulations and regulatory requirements.\nIf we do not adapt to automated buying strategies quickly, our display advertising revenue could be adversely affected.\nThe majority of the display advertising purchased by our national, regional and related advertisers (e.g., insurance advertisers, finance advertisers) is still done manually via insertion orders. Recently however, advertisers of all kinds have been shifting from buying media directly with premium publishers like us to buying their target audiences via the ad exchanges across the broader Internet. While we have grown our programmatic revenue and are developing new, programmatic ad products and are redesigning our ad delivery technology stack, we may not adapt fast enough and may lose display advertising revenue as a result. Due to the concentrated number of national advertisers, our National advertising business can be materially impacted by shifts in media strategy, marketing strategies, agency changes, and financial results of our clients. These changes may occur independent of the products and value we are providing to those advertisers. In addition, the increasing use of ad blockers may reduce the quantity or types of display ads and cookies collected to serve ads.\nIf our mobile applications do not continue to meet consumer demands or we are unable to successfully monetize our mobile advertising solutions, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with consumer technology trends and to ensure we grow our share of the mobile application market so that total advertising impressions across our sites and mobile applications continue to increase. Among other things, we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services on our mobile application platforms, consumers and dealers may believe that the mobile applications and product features of our competitors are superior, and our mobile applications could become incompatible with future operating systems for mobile devices or new mobile device technology. Additionally, in the event that consumer trends lead to market demand for separate digital advertising pricing models for sites and mobile applications, the monetization of mobile advertising could present challenges to our business due to, among other things, lower rates, decreased consumer attention and display advertising design constraints on mobile applications. If use of our mobile applications stagnates or declines, we are not able to successfully monetize mobile application advertising or we cannot adapt our products and services to another form of data viewing, whether on new mobile devices or otherwise, in a timely and cost-effective manner or at all, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain our key employees.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of key employees and our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel, such as individuals with technical skills in a rapidly changing technological environment. Additionally, as the workforce landscape changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we must compete to attract and retain employees. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or the failure to attract or replace qualified personnel may have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nMisappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, enforcement actions to protect our intellectual property and claims from third parties relating to intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the Internet and technology industries. We expect that Internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Our ability to\ncompete depends upon our proprietary systems and technology. While we rely on intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights, we believe that the technical and creative skills of our personnel, continued development of our proprietary systems and technology, brand name recognition and reliable website maintenance are essential in establishing and maintaining a leadership position and strengthening our brands. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and may be expensive. We can provide no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available when our products and services are made available online. In addition, if litigation becomes necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, such litigation, even if successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We also cannot provide any assurance that our products and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Claims of infringement, even if unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. If unsuccessful, we may be subject to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and monetary damages, which may be trebled in the case of willful infringements.\nStrategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage, dilute existing stockholders and significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitability.\nAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as potentially increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition and could strain our human resources. We may be unable to successfully implement effective cost controls or achieve expected synergies as a result of an acquisition. Acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the operation of our core business. Acquisitions may also result in our having greater exposure to the industry risks of the businesses underlying the acquisition. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may not be able to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. We are also exposed to the risk that our partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties that could lead to disruption of investee or partnership activities, or impairment of assets acquired, which could adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity. Acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations or tax consequences which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIn addition, we may be unable to obtain the financing necessary to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Future equity financings would also decrease our earnings per share and the benefits derived from such new ventures or acquisitions might not outweigh or exceed their dilutive effect. Any additional debt financing we secure could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital or to pursue business opportunities.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations could impact our business practices and operating results.\nWe face potential liability and expense for legal claims relating to the information that we publish on our sites and mobile applications, including claims for defamation, libel, negligence and copyright or trademark infringement, among others. We may be subject to claims based on the advertising of our business. Although we have not historically been the subject of any such claims that were material, any such claims that we face in the future could divert management time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to investigate and defend, regardless of the merits of the claims. In some instances, we may elect or be compelled to remove content or may be forced to pay substantial damages if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to defend against these claims. If we elect or are compelled to remove valuable content from our sites or mobile applications, our platforms may become less useful to consumers and our traffic may decline.\nThe value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired depending upon future operating results.\nOur intangible assets were approximately $835.2 million as of December 31, 2020, representing approximately 78% of our total assets. We evaluate our intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying value may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.\nIf we expand into new geographic markets, we may be prevented from using our brands in such markets.\nIf we expand our business into foreign geographic markets, we may not have the ability to adopt trademarks or domain names that are identical or similar to the trademarks and domain names that we use in the United States and Canada. We may face opposition from third parties over the use of our trademarks and applications to register key trademarks in foreign jurisdictions in which we may expand our presence. Third parties may have already adopted identical or similar trademarks to the ones that we use for our services. If we are unsuccessful in defending against these oppositions, our trademark applications may be denied. We could be forced to pay significant settlement costs or cease the use of our trademarks and associated elements of our brands in those or other jurisdictions. Consequently, international expansion may require us to adopt and promote new trademarks, which may be expensive and place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and operating results.\nOur revenue trends are a reflection of our dealer base throughout the year as new customers purchase subscription advertising packages and existing customers purchase or cancel product enhancements. Our display advertising business, targeted to OEMs, experiences some seasonality as a result of consumers\u2019 car buying patterns and the introduction of new vehicle models. Our revenue and operating results have historically been lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition to these seasonal effects, our revenue and operations may be affected by macroeconomic conditions in the automotive sector.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain future earnings to finance and grow our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. All decisions regarding the payment of dividends will be made by our Board of Directors from time to time in accordance with applicable law. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends at any time in the future.\nYour percentage of ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted because of equity awards that we will be granting to our directors, officers and employees or otherwise as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions or capital market transactions. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock that have such designation, powers, preferences and other relative, participating, optional and special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, and Delaware law may discourage takeovers and limit our ability to use, acquire, or develop certain competing businesses.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws, collectively:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock that could be used by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our Board of Directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nplace limits on which stockholders may call special meetings of stockholders, and limit the actions that may be taken at such a meeting;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for elections as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of stockholders may consider such proposal, if effected, desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of our Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions may inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that may result from takeover attempts or speculation.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless our Board of Directors otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors or officers to us or to our stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; any action asserting a claim relating to or involving us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; or any action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as such term is defined in the DGCL. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our common stock.\nStockholders may from time to time attempt to affect changes, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals. Activist stockholders may make strategic proposals related to our business, strategy, management or operations or may request changes to the composition of our Board of Directors. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given as to, the outcome or timing of any such matters. In the event of a proxy contest, our business could be adversely affected. Responding to a proxy contest can be costly, time-consuming and disruptive, and can divert the attention of our management and employees from the operation of our business and execution of our strategic plan. Additionally, if individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders. Further, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, including uncertainties related to the composition of our Board of Directors, may lead to the perception of instability or a change in the direction of our business, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to current or potential customers, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and/or affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties. Moreover, a proxy contest could cause significant fluctuations in the price of our common stock based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nRisks Relating to our Debt Agreements\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our businesses, including restrictions on certain types of transactions and a requirement that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used to service this debt, which reduces cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions. Subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\npermit liens on current or future assets,\n\u2022\nenter into certain corporate transactions,\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness,\n\u2022\nmake certain payments or distributions,\n\u2022\ndispose of certain property,\n\u2022\nprepay or amend the terms of other indebtedness, and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nIncreases in interest rates could increase interest payable under our variable rate indebtedness.\nApproximately 33.1% of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 includes variable rate indebtedness under our financing arrangements. As a result of this indebtedness, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our interest rates are based on a floating rate index, and changes in interest rates could increase the amount of our interest payments and thus negatively impact our future earnings and cash flows. Although we have entered into interest rate swap agreements on our Term Loan to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of the extended term, we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate swap agreements in the\nfuture on acceptable terms or that such swaps or the swaps we have in place now will be effective. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to make interest payments, we may be required to refinance all or part of our outstanding debt, sell assets, borrow additional money or sell securities, none of which we can guarantee we would be able to complete on acceptable terms or at all.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process, potential phasing out of LIBOR and any transition to SOFR may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations, including our long-term debt instruments and our bank credit facilities.\nBeginning in 2017, U.K.-based regulatory authorities with overview over LIBOR and its administration announced a phase-out of the publication of LIBOR rates that will be completed in 2023. As a response to the phase-out of LIBOR, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. In 2020, we amended our bank credit facilities to hard-wire a customary mechanism that allows the administrative agent to replace LIBOR as the benchmark rate with SOFR under certain circumstances, including in connection with a phase-out of LIBOR. SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions and is fundamentally different from LIBOR for two key reasons. First, SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate. Second, SOFR is an overnight rate, while LIBOR represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events, and since its publication began in 2018, daily changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or other market rates. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether changes related to the phase-out of LIBOR, including insufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets, alternative reference rates or other reforms, as they occur, will not have an adverse effect on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations and interest rate swaps, including our long-term debt instruments and our bank credit facilities.", "PERMNO": 16696, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CARS"}
