{"cik": "1631282", "company": "DATASEA INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Common Stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any shares of our Common Stock. No purchase of our Common Stock should be made by any person who is not in a position to lose the entire amount of his or her investment. The order of the following risk factors is presented arbitrarily. You should not conclude the significance of a risk factor because of the order of presentation. Our business and operations could be seriously harmed as a result of any of these risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe are an early stage company with a very limited operating history as a provider of Internet security equipment, new media advertising and data processing services. Our limited operating history may not provide an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations.\nWe have a very limited operating history. Our operating entity, Shuhai Beijing, was formed in February 2015 and has yet to generate revenue and it may not generate material revenue or any profit for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that Internet security products along with new media advertising, micro marketing, ISP connecting, and big data processing services will be its core business and main revenue producing sectors in the future. We have limited experience and operating history in developing and marketing the foregoing products and services. In addition, the market for our products and services is highly competitive. If we fail to successfully develop and offer our products and services in an increasingly competitive market, we may not be able to capture the growth opportunities associated with the products and services or recover our development and marketing costs, and our future results of operations and growth strategies could be adversely affected. Our limited history may not provide a meaningful basis for investors to evaluate our business, financial performance and prospects.\nOur independent registered auditors\u2019 report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are an early stage company and has limited financial resources. We had a cash balance of $11,802 as of June 30, 2016. We have working capital deficit of $114,321 and a stockholders\u2019 equity of $559 at June 30, 2016. Our independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion on our financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2016 that states that Company losses from operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur current resources and source of funds, which primarily consist of loans and capital contributions from shareholders and funds raise from equity financing. We believe these are sufficient to keep our business operations functioning for the next twelve months. We have not generated any revenues from our business, and our expenses will be accrued and deferred until sufficient financing is obtained or our shareholders loan the necessary funds to pay for these expenses. No assurances can be given that we will be able to receive funds from our shareholders or others to continue our operations. We may seek additional financing. The financing sought may be in the form of equity or debt financing from various sources as yet unidentified. No assurances can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue or obtain the necessary financing to continue as a going concern.\nOur current distribution model heavily relies on regional agents and disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\nCurrently, we heavily rely on regional agents to distribute our Internet security equipment. Under such business model, a majority of our products will be sold through our regional agents. We expect to sell our Internet security equipment to regional agents who will then maintain stock inventory and sell that inventory directly to end users at higher prices. These agents will also occasionally provide system installation, technical support, professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. In selecting regional agents, we focus on their ability to leverage local connections and relationships with local branches of the Ministry of Public Security of the PRC to sell our products. We anticipate that product sales through regional distribution agents will account for a majority of our product sales in the near future. Relying on indirect sales may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.\nThe current distribution model can be adversely affected by a couple of factors which could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model and further adversely affect our sales and margins, including the following:\n\u00b7 Some of our regional agents may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear;\n\u00b7 Some of our regional agents may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand the challenges related to changes in business conditions;\n\u00b7 Some of our regional agents may lose their relationships or connections with local branches of the PRC Ministry of Public Security; and\n\u00b7 Revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors\u2019 financial conditions or operations weaken.\nSupply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins.\nCurrently, we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities but instead rely on a third party contractor to manufacturer our products, and we expect that we will continue to rely on existing and new contractual manufacturers for the foreseeable future. Such reliance could have adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results:\n\u00b7 Any financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers could either limit supply or increase costs;\n\u00b7 Reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit supply or increase costs; and\n\u00b7 Industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets could limit supply or increase costs.\nIn addition, the following supply chain-related issues could adversely affect our customer relationship, operating results and financial condition:\n\u00b7 a reduction or interruption in supply of one or more components;\n\u00b7 a significant increase in the price of one or more components;\n\u00b7 a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; and\n\u00b7 a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs.\nOver the long term, we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results.\nWhile we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key growth areas, such as Internet security products and services. We are likely to recognize the costs and expenses associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internet-based systems.\nA substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the Internet in the PRC and globally, including the continued development of the Internet. To the extent that an economic slowdown or economic uncertainty and any related reductions in capital spending adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBecause of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost-effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be performance problems with Internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. Because Internet security equipment is our major products, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock independent of direct effects on our business.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.\nThe Internet security equipment we provide is highly complex as the products incorporate both hardware and software technologies. Neither we nor our contract manufacturer have developed a sophisticated product testing program. There can be no assurance that the pre-shipment testing programs we develop in the future will be adequate to detect all defects, including defects in individual products or defects affecting numerous shipments. Such potential defects might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins. As an example, software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. From time to time, we will have to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in our products. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have material impact on our revenue, margins and net income.\nBecause of the capital-intensive nature of our business, we will likely have to incur indebtedness or issue new equity securities. If we are not able to obtain additional capital, our ability to operate or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business requires significant levels of capital to finance the research and development of new products and service platforms that meet the constantly evolving industry standards and consumer demands. As such, we expect that we will need additional capital to fund our future growth. We currently primarily depend on loans and capital contributions from our founders, Ms. Zhixin Liu and Mr. Fu Liu, who currently serve as our only officers and directors. If cash from such available sources is insufficient or unavailable, or if cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. Our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms or at all is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 investors\u2019 perceptions of, and demand for, companies operating in China;\n\u00b7 conditions of the U.S. and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds;\n\u00b7 our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows;\n\u00b7 governmental regulation of foreign investment in China;\n\u00b7 economic, political and other conditions in the United States, China and other countries; and\n\u00b7 governmental policies relating to foreign currency borrowings.\nThe sale of additional equity securities would result in dilution of our existing shareholders. In addition, the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. It is highly uncertain whether financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur success is dependent on retaining key personnel who would be difficult to replace.\nOur success depends largely on the continued services of our key management and technical staff. In particular, our success depends on the continued efforts of Ms. Zhixin Liu, our Chairman of the Board irectors, Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, and Mr. Fu Liu, our director. Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu (who are daughter and father) have been instrumental in developing our business model and are crucial to our business development. There can be no assurance that they will continue in their present capacities for any particular period of time. The loss of the services of Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu could materially and adversely affect our business development. In addition, the development of new Internet security products and marketing service platform requires us to retain certain key technical staff. Our research and development efforts rely on Mr. Zhiqiang Qian, our research and development director and senior engineers Messrs. Jiangshan Liu and Ruiping Shen. The loss of these technical staff would negatively affect our introduction of new products and service platforms, our ability to capture new market share and our ability to generate sales revenue.\nThe Internet security product and various service industries we are in are characterized by constant and rapid technological change and evolving standards. If we fail to anticipate and adapt to these changes and evolutions, our sales, gross margins and profitability will be adversely affected.\nTechnologies change rapidly in the Internet security product, new media advertising, micro marketing and data processing industries with frequent new product and service developments and evolving industry standards. Companies operating within these industries are continuously developing new products and services with heightened performance and functionality, putting pricing pressure on existing products. Accordingly, we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate technological changes and to offer additional product and service opportunities that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our failure to accurately anticipate the introduction of new technologies or adapt to fluctuations in the industry could lead to our having significant amounts of obsolete inventory that can only be sold at substantially lower prices and profit margins than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to develop planned new technologies, we may be unable to compete effectively due to our failure to offer products or services most demanded by the marketplace. Products and services that our competitors develop or introduce may also render our products and services noncompetitive or obsolete. If any of these failures occur, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may face heightened competition from existing mature competitors as well as new entrants into the Internet security equipment and service industries in which we compete within the PRC. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose customers and our financial results will be negatively affected.\nThe Internet security equipment industry in the PRC is highly competitive. Currently, Shuhai Beijing\u2019s primary competitors for Internet security equipment and ISP connecting services are mature companies with longer operating histories, more engineering resources, relatively sophisticated distribution channels and existing customer bases. Further, there are new competitors entering the micro marketing, new media advertising and data processing services industries. As a result, we could experience difficulties in obtaining customers, capturing market share, and generating revenue from our major products and services.\nChanges to existing regulations may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the provision of our product, which may significantly increase our costs and adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe Internet security industry in China is highly regulated by the PRC Ministry of Public Security. In particular, Computer Information System Security Specific Product Testing and Sales License Management Method (Ministry of Public Security Order No. 32) sets forth the technical standards for Internet security products as well as the procedures for applying for and maintaining permits for selling such products. The PRC Ministry of Public Security might change the regulatory framework or impose higher technical standards in the future. As a result, we would have to incur extra costs in connection with engaging new technical staff, improving our existing products, and renewing our permit.\nThe legal requirements associated with being a public company, including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may make it difficult for us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of our business and our ability to maintain listing of our Common Stock.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors required to provide for our effective management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly listed companies, including, but not limited to, certifications by principal executive officers. Currently, none of our officers or directors have experience in operating a U.S. public company. Moreover, the actual and perceived personal risks associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and other public company requirements may deter qualified individuals from accepting roles as directors and executive officers. At present, we do not maintain an independent board and do not have any board members who would meet the independence requirements of the various exchanges. Further, the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual\u2019s independence and level of experience in finance and accounting matters, may make it difficult to attract and retain qualified board members going forward. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management of our business and our ability to retain the listing of our Common Stock on any stock exchange or quotation system could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our business and adversely impact the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe are required to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and to comply with other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) thereunder. Our senior management, which currently consists solely of Ms. Zhixin Liu, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management\u2019s override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nWe may be unable to complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nWe will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by our management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling a system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our Common Stock shares to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nWe will also be required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the recently enacted JOBS Act (as defined below), if we take advantage (as we expect to do) of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time and subject to other conditions being met, we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 31.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future. Any of the foregoing occurrences, should they come to pass, could negatively impact the public perception of our company, which could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nOur compliance with complicated U.S. regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses. Moreover, our ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations is uncertain given our management\u2019s relative inexperience with operating U.S. public companies.\nAs a new public company, we will be faced with expensive, complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards of a U.S. public company are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nMoreover, our executive officers have little experience in operating a U.S. public company, which makes our ability to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations uncertain. Our failure to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price.\nRisks Relating to the Our Corporate Structure\nOur corporate structure, in particular, our \u201cVIE Contractual Agreements are subject to significant risks, as set forth in the following risk factors.\nWe are a holding company that depends on cash flow from Shuhai Skill (HK), its subsidiary and Shuhai Beijing to meet our obligations.\nAfter the consummation of the Share Exchange, we became a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of Shuhai Skill (HK). Accordingly, all of our operations are conducted through Shuhai Skill (HK), its direct subsidiary Tianjin Information and its variable interest entity Shuhai Beijing. We currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will primarily be retained and used in their operations.\nWe depend upon the VIE Contractual Agreements in conducting our business in the PRC, which may not be as effective as direct ownership.\nOur affiliation with Shuhai Beijing is managed through the VIE Contractual Agreements, which agreements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Shuhai Beijing as direct ownership. The VIE Contractual Agreements are governed by and would be interpreted in accordance with the PRC laws. They also provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration pursuant to PRC laws. If Shuhai Beijing fails to perform the obligations under the VIE Contractual Agreements, we may have to rely on legal remedies under the PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages. There is a risk that we may be unable to obtain any of these remedies. The legal environment in China is not as developed as in other jurisdictions. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce the VIE Contractual Agreements.\nWe may not be able to consolidate the financial results of some of our affiliated companies or such consolidation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAll of our business is conducted through Shuhai Beijing, which currently is considered a VIE for accounting purposes, and we are considered the primary beneficiary, thus enabling us to consolidate our financial results in our consolidated financial statements. In the event that in the future a company we hold as a VIE no longer meets the definition of a VIE, or we are deemed not to be the primary beneficiary, we would not be able to consolidate line by line that entity\u2019s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for PRC purposes. Also, if in the future an affiliate company becomes a VIE and we become the primary beneficiary, we would be required to consolidate that entity\u2019s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for PRC purposes. If such entity\u2019s financial results were negative, this could have a corresponding negative impact on our operating results for PRC purposes. However, any material variations in the accounting principles, practices and methods used in preparing financial statements for PRC purposes from the principles, practices and methods generally accepted in the United States and in the SEC accounting regulations must be discussed, quantified and reconciled in financial statements for United States and SEC purposes.\nBecause we rely on the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement with Shuhai Beijing for our revenue, the termination of this agreement would severely and detrimentally affect our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure.\nWe are a holding company and all of our business operations are conducted through the VIE Contractual Agreements. As a result, our revenues rely on dividend payments from Tianjin Information after it receives payments from Shuhai Beijing pursuant to the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement. Shuhai Beijing may terminate the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement without cause. Because neither we, nor our subsidiaries, own equity interests of Shuhai Beijing, the termination of the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement would sever our ability to continue receiving payments from Shuhai Beijing under our current holding company structure. While we are currently not aware of any event or reason that may cause the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement to terminate, we cannot assure you that such an event or reason will not occur in the future. In the event that the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement is terminated, this may have a severe and detrimental effect on our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure, which, in turn, may affect the value of your investment.\nContractual arrangements entered into by our subsidiary and our PRC operating affiliate may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. Such scrutiny may lead to additional tax liability and fines, which would hinder our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nUnder PRC law, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. If any of the transactions entered into by our subsidiary and our PRC operating affiliate are found not to have been conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis or to result in an unreasonable reduction in tax under PRC law, the PRC tax authorities have the authority to disallow tax savings, adjust the profits and losses of our respective PRC entities and assess late payment interest and penalties.\nWe conduct our business through Shuhai Beijing by means of contractual arrangements. If the PRC courts or administrative authorities determine that these contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in such Chinese laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThere are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the laws, rules and regulations governing the validity and enforcement of the contractual arrangements between Tianjin Shuhai and Shuhai Beijing. Although we have been advised by our PRC counsel, Zhongyin Law Offices, that based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, rules and regulations, the structure for operating our business in China (including our corporate structure and contractual arrangements with Shuhai Beijing and its stockholders) comply with all applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and do not violate, breach, contravene or otherwise conflict with any applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, the PRC courts or regulatory authorities may determine that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements violate PRC laws, rules or regulations. We are aware of a case involving Chinachem Financial Services where certain contractual arrangements for a Hong Kong Company to gain economic control over a PRC Company were declared to be void by the PRC Supreme People\u2019s Court. If the PRC courts or regulatory authorities determine that our contractual arrangements are in violation of applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, our contractual arrangements will become invalid or unenforceable.\nIf any of our PRC entities or their ownership structure or the contractual arrangements are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules or regulations, or any of our PRC entities fail to obtain or maintain any of the required governmental permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n\u00b7 revoking the business and operating licenses;\n\u00b7 discontinuing or restricting the operations;\n\u00b7 imposing conditions or requirements with which the PRC entities may not be able to comply;\n\u00b7 requiring us and our PRC entities to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;\n\u00b7 restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from this offering to finance our business and operations in China; or\n\u00b7 imposing fines.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn or around September 2011, various media sources reported that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the \u201cCSRC\u201d) had prepared a report proposing pre-approval by a competent central government authority of offshore listings by China-based companies with variable interest entity structures, such as ours, that operate in industry sectors subject to foreign investment restrictions. However, it is unclear whether the CSRC officially issued or submitted such a report to a higher level government authority or what any such report provides, or whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or what they would provide. If our ownership structure, contractual arrangements or businesses of Shuhai Beijing are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the relevant governmental authorities, including the CSRC, would have broad discretion in dealing with such violation, including levying fines, confiscating our income or the income of Shuhai Beijing, revoking the business licenses or operating licenses of Shuhai Beijing, discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations, requiring us to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring, restricting or prohibiting our use of proceeds from this offering to finance our business and operations in China, and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and severely damage our reputation, which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe draft Foreign Investment Law proposes sweeping changes to the PRC foreign investment legal regime and will likely to have a significant impact on businesses in China controlled by foreign invested enterprises primarily through contractual arrangements, such as our business.\nOn January 19, 2015, the PRC Ministry of Finance (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) published a draft of the PRC Law on Foreign Investment (Draft for Comment), or the Foreign Investment Law, which is open for public comments until February 17, 2015. At the same time, MOFCOM published an accompanying explanatory note of the draft Foreign Investment Law, or the Explanatory Note, which contains important information about the draft Foreign Investment Law, including its drafting philosophy and principles, main content, plans to transition to the new legal regime and treatment of business in China controlled by foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, primarily through contractual arrangements. The draft Foreign Investment Law is intended to replace the current foreign investment legal regime consisting of three laws: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law, as well as detailed implementing rules. The draft Foreign Investment Law proposes significant changes to the PRC foreign investment legal regime and may have a material impact on Chinese companies listed or to be listed overseas. The proposed Foreign Investment Law is to regulate FIEs the same way as PRC domestic entities, except for those FIEs that operate in industries deemed to be either \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d in a \u201cNegative List.\u201d Because the Negative List has yet to be published, it is unclear whether it will differ from the current list of industries subject to restrictions or prohibitions on foreign investment (including our industry). The draft Foreign Investment Law also provides that only FIEs operating in industries on the Negative List will require entry clearance and other approvals that are not required of PRC domestic entities. As a result of the entry clearance and approvals, certain FIE\u2019s operating in industries on the Negative List may not be able to continue to conduct their operations through contractual arrangements.\nThe specifics of the draft Foreign Investment Law\u2019s application to variable entity structures have yet to be proposed, but it is anticipated that the draft Foreign Investment Law will regulate variable interest entities. MOFCOM suggests both registration and approval as potential options for the regulation of variable entity structures, depending on whether they are \u201cChinese\u201d or \u201cforeign-controlled.\u201d One of the core concepts of the draft Foreign Investment Law is \u201cde facto control,\u201d which emphasizes substance over form in determining whether an entity is \u201cChinese\u201d or \u201cforeign-controlled.\u201d This determination requires considering the nature of the investors that exercise control over the entity. \u201cChinese investors\u201d are natural persons who are Chinese nationals, Chinese government agencies and any domestic enterprise controlled by Chinese nationals or government agencies. \u201cForeign investors\u201d are foreign citizens, foreign governments, international organizations and entities controlled by foreign citizens and entities. We are majority controlled by Mr. and Ms. Liu, both of whom are PRC nationals, therefore, it increases the likelihood that our company may be deemed \u201cChinese\u201d controlled. In its current form, the draft Foreign Investment Law will make it difficult for foreign financial investors, including private equity and venture capital firms, to obtain a controlling interest of a Chinese enterprise in a foreign restricted industry. However, under the proposed new law, we may no longer need to hold interests in our operating affiliate through contractual arrangements and may be able to have control through direct equity ownership.\nThere is substantial uncertainty regarding the draft Foreign Investment Law, including, among others, what the actual content of the law will be as well as the adoption timeline or effective date of the final form of the law. While such uncertainty exists, we cannot determine whether the new foreign investment law, when it is adopted and becomes effective, will not have a material positive or negative impact on our corporate structure and business.\nThe contractual agreements that we have with our PRC operating affiliate may be determined to be a mechanism to circumvent the restriction of foreign ownership of a business in the PRC, and therefore could be determined to be unenforceable because they are against public policy.\nWe do not have a direct ownership interest in Shuhai Beijing, our PRC operating affiliate. Instead, through a series of contractual arrangements entered into between Shuhai Beijing and our subsidiary, Tianjin Information, we are able to: (i) exert effective control over our PRC operating affiliate; (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits derived from the business operations of our PRC operating affiliate; and (iii) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in our PRC operating affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is a risk that these contractual agreements between Shuhai Beijing and our subsidiary, Tianjin Information, may be determined by a government agency in the PRC to be a mechanism to circumvent the restrictions on foreign ownership of a PRC business and therefore could be determined to be unenforceable because they are against public policy in the PRC. If the agreements were determined to be void as against public policy, we would have no right to the economic benefits from the operations of our PRC affiliate and we would have no other means of generating revenue.\nIf any of our affiliated entities becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, we may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by such entity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently conduct our operations in China through contractual arrangements with our affiliated entities. As part of these arrangements, substantially all of our assets that are important to the operation of our business are held by our affiliated entities. If any of these entities goes bankrupt and all or part of their assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our business activities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of our affiliated entities undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, its equity owner or unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights relating to some or all of these assets, which would hinder our ability to operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our business, our ability to generate revenue and the market price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Associated With Doing Business in China\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of our business.\nThe PRC\u2019s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic conditions within the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, there is no assurance that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social environment.\nA slowdown or other adverse developments in the PRC economy may harm our customers and the demand for our services and our products.\nAll of our operations are conducted in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in recent years, there is no assurance that this growth will continue. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn, a recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC could significantly reduce the demand for our product and services.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.\nAt various times during recent years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries that may affect our economic outlook both in the United States and in China. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to our business, could reduce the price of our Common Stock.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit the profitability of our business in China.\nIn recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our services and products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies, it may have an adverse effect on profitability. These factors have led to the adoption by Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our services and products.\nThe fluctuation of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nThe change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, various factors, such as changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under such policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Later on, the People\u2019s Bank of China has decided to further implement the reform of the RMB exchange regime and to enhance the flexibility of RMB exchange rates. Such changes in policy have resulted in a significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar since 2005. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant adjustment of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.\nAny significant appreciation or revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on the value of, and any dividends payable on, shares of our Common Stock in foreign currency terms. More specifically, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our initial public offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the exchange rate of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar could materially and adversely affect the price of shares of our Common Stock in U.S. dollars without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenue effectively.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi. As a result, restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use revenue generated in Renminbi to fund any business activities we may have outside China in the future or to make dividend payments to our shareholders in U.S. dollars. Under current PRC laws and regulations, Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend distributions. However, Renminbi is not freely convertible for direct investment or loans or investments in securities outside China, unless such use is approved by SAFE. For example, foreign exchange transactions under our subsidiary\u2019s capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, remain subject to significant foreign exchange controls and the approval requirement of SAFE. These limitations could affect our ability to obtain foreign exchange for capital expenditures.\nOur subsidiaries and affiliated entities in China are subject to restrictions on making dividends and other payments to us.\nWe are a holding company and rely principally on dividends paid by our subsidiary in China for our cash needs, including paying dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders to the extent we choose to do so, servicing any debt we may incur and paying our operating expenses. Shuhai Skill (HK)\u2019s income in turn depends on the service fees paid by our affiliated entities. Current PRC regulations permit our subsidiary in China to pay dividends to us only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Under the applicable requirements of PRC law, Shuhai Skill (HK) may only distribute dividends after it has made allowances to fund certain statutory reserves. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, at the end of each fiscal year, our school as a private school in China is required to allocate a certain amount to its development fund for the construction or maintenance of the school properties or purchase or upgrade of school facilities. In addition, if our subsidiaries or our affiliated entities in China incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any such restrictions may materially affect such entities\u2019 ability to make dividends or make payments, in service fees or otherwise, to us, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of other companies or government agencies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. Although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions in a civil law system may be cited as reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, newly introduced PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections of interest relating to foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of such laws and regulations may not always be consistent, and enforcement of these laws and regulations involves significant uncertainties, any of which could limit the available legal protections.\nIn addition, the PRC administrative and judicial authorities have significant discretion in interpreting, implementing or enforcing statutory rules and contractual terms, and it may be more difficult to predict the outcome of administrative and judicial proceedings and the level of legal protection we may enjoy in the PRC than under some more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may affect our decisions on the policies and actions to be taken to comply with PRC laws and regulations, and may affect our ability to enforce our contractual or tort rights. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited legal actions or threats in an attempt to extract payments or benefits from us. Such uncertainties may therefore increase our operating expenses and costs, and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe PRC\u2019s legal and judicial system may not adequately protect our business and operations and the rights of foreign investors.\nThe PRC legal and judicial system may negatively impact foreign investors. In 1982, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Constitution of China to authorize foreign investment and guarantee the \u201clawful rights and interests\u201d of foreign investors in the PRC. However, the PRC\u2019s system of laws is not yet comprehensive. The legal and judicial systems in the PRC are still rudimentary, and enforcement of existing laws is inconsistent. As a result, it may be impossible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of laws that do exist, or to obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction. The PRC\u2019s legal system is based on the civil law regime, that is, it is based on written statutes. A decision by one judge does not set a legal precedent that is required to be followed by judges in other cases. In addition, the interpretation of Chinese laws may be varied to reflect domestic political changes.\nThe promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws and the pre-emption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. There can be no assurance that a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic or social life, will not affect the PRC government\u2019s ability to continue to support and pursue these reforms. Such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States and all of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights based on U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors in the U.S. or to enforce a U.S. court judgment against us or them in the PRC.\nOur directors and officers reside outside the United States. In addition, our operating subsidiaries are located in the PRC and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us in the courts of either the U.S. or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in U.S. courts, it may be difficult to enforce such judgments in PRC courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement of criminal penalties against us or our officers and directors under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise.\nWe may be required to obtain prior approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, of the listing and trading of our Common Stock.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory authorities, including the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, State Administration for Industry and Commerce of PRC, or SAIC, CSRC and SAFE, jointly issued the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules. This regulation, among other things, requires that the listing and trading on an overseas stock exchange of securities in an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for purposes of holding direct or indirect equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals be approved by the CSRC. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website the procedures for such approval process. In particular, certain documents are required to be filed with the CSRC as part of the approval procedures and it could take several months to complete the approval process.\nWhile the implementation and interpretation of the M&A Rules remains unclear, we believe, based on the advice of our PRC counsel, that approval by the CSRC is not required because we are not a special purpose vehicle formed or controlled by PRC companies or PRC individuals as defined under the M&A Rules. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC regulatory authorities, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as our PRC counsel. If the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authority subsequently determines that we need to obtain the CSRC\u2019s approval for this resale registration, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities. In such event, these regulatory authorities may, among other things, impose fines and penalties on or otherwise restrict our operations in the PRC or delay or restrict any remittance of the proceeds from this resale registration into the PRC. Any such or other actions taken could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nCertain PRC regulations, including the M&A Rules and national security regulations, may require a complicated review and approval process which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nThe M&A Rules established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. For example, the MOFCOM must be notified in the event a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. In addition, certain acquisitions of domestic companies by offshore companies that are related to or affiliated with the same entities or individuals of the domestic companies, are subject to approval by the MOFCOM. In addition, the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, issued by the MOFCOM in August 2011, require that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors in \u201cany industry with national security concerns\u201d be subject to national security review by the MOFCOM. In addition, any activities attempting to circumvent such review process, including structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement, are strictly prohibited.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the interpretation and implementation of these regulations relating to merger and acquisition activities in China. In addition, complying with these requirements could be time-consuming, and the required notification, review or approval process may materially delay or affect our ability to complete merger and acquisition transactions in China. As a result, our ability to seek growth through acquisitions may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, if the MOFCOM determines that we should have obtained its approval for our entry into contractual arrangements with our affiliated entities, we may be required to file for remedial approvals. There is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such approval from the MOFCOM. We may also be subject to administrative fines or penalties by the MOFCOM that may require us to limit our business operations in the PRC, delay or restrict the conversion and remittance of our funds in foreign currencies into the PRC or take other actions that could have material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary and affiliated entities, which could harm our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nAs an offshore holding company of our PRC subsidiary, we may (i) make loans to our PRC subsidiary and affiliated entities, (ii) make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary, (iii) establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, and (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in an offshore transaction. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example:\n\u00b7 loans by us to our wholly-owned subsidiary in China, which is a foreign-invested enterprise, cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC, or SAFE, or its local counterparts;\n\u00b7 loans by us to our affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, over a certain threshold must be approved by the relevant government authorities and must also be registered with SAFE or its local counterparts; and\n\u00b7 capital contributions to our wholly-owned subsidiary must be approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterparts.\nOn August 29, 2008, State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) promulgated Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its capital contribution in foreign currency into Renminbi. The notice requires that the capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies shall be used only for purposes within the business scope as approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Such loan may not be used for equity investments within the PRC unless such activity is set forth in the business scope or is otherwise permissible under PRC laws or regulations. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of such capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be changed without SAFE\u2019s approval, and may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not otherwise been used. Violations of Circular 142 will result in severe penalties including heavy fines. As a result, Circular 142 may significantly limit our ability to transfer funds to our operations in China through our PRC subsidiary, which may adversely affect our ability to expand our business.\nSAFE also promulgated Circular 59 on November 9, 2010, which, among other things, requires the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings to be closely examined and the net proceeds to be settled in the manner described in the offering documents, or otherwise approved by the board of directors. Accordingly, as we apply with SAFE to convert foreign currencies into Renminbi funds for use of such funds in the PRC, they need to be used in accordance with the section entitled \u201cUse of Proceeds,\u201d or when the proposed use of the proceeds is inconsistent with what is set forth in the section entitled \u201cUse of Proceeds,\u201d we need to submit a board resolution in relation to such proposed use of proceeds to SAFE and the settlement of foreign exchange for such use of proceeds must comply with PRC regulations in relation to foreign exchange.\nIn addition, SAFE issued an internal guideline to its local counterparts, referred to as Circular 45, in November 2011. Based on the version of Circular 45 made publicly available by certain local governmental authorities on their websites, we understand that Circular 45 requires SAFE\u2019s local counterparts to strengthen the control imposed by Circulars 142 and 59 over the conversion of a foreign-invested company\u2019s capital contributed in foreign currency into RMB. Circular 45 stipulates that a foreign-invested company\u2019s RMB funds, if converted from such company\u2019s capital contributed in foreign currency, may not be used by such company to (i) extend loans (in the form of entrusted loans), (ii) repay borrowings between enterprises, or (iii) repay bank loans it has obtained.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital contributions by us to our entities in China. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to use capital raised and to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nA failure by the beneficial owners of our shares who are PRC residents to comply with certain PRC foreign exchange regulations could restrict our ability to distribute profits, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities and subject us to liability under PRC law.\nSAFE has promulgated regulations, including the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents\u2019 Investment and Financing and Round-Trip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, effective on July 4, 2014, and its appendices, that require PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion.\nThese regulations apply to our direct and indirect shareholders who are PRC residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions or share transfers that we make in the future if our shares are issued to PRC residents. However, in practice, different local SAFE branches may have different views and procedures on the application and implementation of SAFE regulations, and since SAFE Circular No. 37 was issued a year ago, there remains uncertainty with respect to its implementation. We have requested PRC residents who we know currently hold direct or indirect interests in our company to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under SAFE Circular No. 37 and other related rules. However, we cannot assure you that these individuals or any other direct or indirect shareholders or beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents will be able to successfully complete the registration or update the registration of their direct and indirect equity interest as required in the future. If they fail to make or update the registration, our PRC subsidiary could be subject to fines and legal penalties, and SAFE could restrict our cross-border investment activities and our foreign exchange activities, including restricting our PRC subsidiary\u2019s ability to distribute dividends to, or obtain loans denominated in foreign currencies from, our company, or prevent us from paying dividends. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests and exercising your rights as a stockholder of ours since we conduct substantially all of our operations in China and all of our officers and directors reside in China.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations in China through Shuhai Beijing, our consolidated VIE in China. All of our current officers and directors reside outside the United States and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. Because of this factor, it may be difficult for you to conduct due diligence on the Company, our executive officers or directors and attend stockholders meetings if the meetings are held in China. As a result, our public stockholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major stockholders than would stockholders of a corporation doing business entirely or predominantly within the United States.\nYou may experience difficulties in protecting your rights through the United States courts.\nCurrently, substantially all of our operations are conducted in China and substantially all of our assets are located in China. All of our officers are nationals or residents of the PRC and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a stockholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or to enforce judgments against us which are obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nIn addition, it may be difficult or impossible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon us our directors and officers in the event that you believe that your rights have been violated under United States securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in effecting service of process and bringing an action of this kind, the laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the PRC of judgments obtained in the United States.\nLabor contract laws in China may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn June 29, 2007, the PRC government promulgated the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, or the Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. The Labor Contract Law imposes greater liabilities on employers and significantly affects the cost of an employer\u2019s decision to reduce its workforce. Further, it requires certain terminations be based on the mandatory requirement age. In the event we decide to significantly change or decrease our workforce, the Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to enact such changes in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost-effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability.\nThe economy of China has been experiencing significant growth, leading to inflation and increased labor costs. China\u2019s overall economy and the average wage in the PRC are expected to continue to grow. Future increases in China\u2019s inflation and material increases in the cost of labor may materially and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations unless we are able pass on these costs to our students by increasing tuition.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports included in this report include audit documentation located in China. PCAOB currently cannot inspect audit documentation located in China and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm issued an audit opinion on the financial statements included in this report filed with the SEC. As auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, work papers located in China are not currently inspected by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities.\nInspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. However, the PCAOB is currently unable to inspect an auditor\u2019s audit work related to a company\u2019s operations in China and where such documentation of the audit work is located in China. As a result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB\u2019s oversight of our auditors through such inspections.\nThe inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our auditors\u2019 work papers in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. Investors may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur majority stockholders will control our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval.\nOur officers and directors collectively have over 80% beneficial ownership of our Company. This is particularly the case as our two directors are members of the same family. As a result, such individuals will have the ability, acting together, to control the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our Company, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other shareholders and be disadvantageous to our shareholders with interests different from those individuals. Certain of these individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers or directors of our company. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our company.\nAn active and visible trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nWe cannot predict whether an active market for our Common Stock will develop in the future. In the absence of an active trading market:\n\u00b7 Investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;\n\u00b7 Market visibility for our Common Stock may be limited; and\n\u00b7 A lack of visibility for our Common Stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for our Common Stock.\nThe trading price of the Common Stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, changes in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, announcements of innovations by us or our competitors, general conditions in the industry in which we operate and other factors. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may have a material or adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe market price for our Common Stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for our Common Stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as:\n\u00b7 the perception of U.S. investors and regulators of U.S. listed Chinese companies;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u00b7 negative publicity, studies or reports;\n\u00b7 conditions in Chinese and global cybersecurity product markets;\n\u00b7 our capability to match and compete with technology innovations in the industry;\n\u00b7 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies in the same industry;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; and\n\u00b7 general economic or political conditions in or impacting China.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nOur Common Stock is \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our Common Stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our Common Stock may not develop or be sustained.\nOur Common Stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.\nOur Common Stock may be considered to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if it does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act, as amended. Our Common Stock may be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if it meets one or more of the following conditions: (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is NOT traded on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange; (iii) it is not quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even if so, has a price less than $5.00 per share; or (iv) is issued by a company that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than $5 million. The principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our Common Stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to: (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our Common Stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell shares of our Common Stock, which could depress the price of shares of our Common Stock.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell shares of our Common Stock, have an adverse effect on the market for shares of our Common Stock, and thereby depress price of our Common Stock.\nYou may face significant restrictions on the resale of your shares of our Common Stock due to state \u201cblue sky\u201d laws.\nEach state has its own securities laws, often called \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state\u2019s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state.\nWe do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our Common Stock. We have not yet applied to have our securities registered in any state and will not do so until we receive expressions of interest from investors resident in specific states after they have viewed this prospectus. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market for our Common Stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.\nPotential future sales under Rule 144 may depress the market price for the Common Stock.\nIn general, under Rule 144, a person who has satisfied a minimum holding period of between six months to one-year, as well as meeting any other applicable requirements of Rule 144, may thereafter sell such shares publicly. Therefore, the possible sale of unregistered shares may, in the future, have a depressive effect on the price of our Common Stock in the over-the-counter market.\nVolatility in our Common Stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our Common Stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. Should we determine to pay dividends in the future, our ability to do so will depend upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from Shuhai Beijing. Shuhai Beijing may, from time to time, be subject to restrictions on its ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions.", "PERMNO": 18306, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "DTSS"}
