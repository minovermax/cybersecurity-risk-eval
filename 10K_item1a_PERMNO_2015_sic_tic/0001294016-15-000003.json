{"cik": "1294016", "company": "RUCKUS WIRELESS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating Ruckus and our business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf the market for our products does not develop as we expect, demand for our products may not grow as we expect.\nWe develop and provide Wi-Fi products and services for service providers and enterprises. The success of our business depends on the continued growth and reliance on Wi-Fi in these markets. The recent growth of the market for Wi-Fi networks is being driven by the increased use of Wi-Fi-enabled mobile devices and the use of Wi-Fi as a preferred connectivity option to support video, voice and other higher-bandwidth uses. As a result, mobile service providers and enterprises are struggling to address the capacity gap, including increased demands on their networks and the significant investment required to upgrade network capacity and provide ubiquitous wireless connectivity.\nA number of barriers may prevent service providers or their subscribers from adopting Wi-Fi technology to address the capacity gap in wireless networks. For example, Wi-Fi operates over an unlicensed radio spectrum, and if the Wi-Fi spectrum becomes crowded, Wi-Fi solutions will be a less attractive option for service providers. In addition, in order for Wi-Fi solutions to adequately address the potential future capacity gap, mobile devices should automatically switch from a cellular data network to the service provider\u2019s Wi-Fi network, when available and appropriate. Generally, mobile devices do not switch to unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks without input from the device user, and often require the user to log in when a new Wi-Fi network is accessed, which may tend to limit a subscriber\u2019s use of Wi-Fi. These and other factors could limit or slow the adoption of Wi-Fi technologies by service providers as a means to address this potential future capacity gap.\nThere is no guarantee that service providers and enterprises will continue to utilize Wi-Fi technology, that use of Wi-Fi-enabled mobile devices will continue to increase or that Wi-Fi will continue to be the preferred connectivity option for the uses described above. There is also no guarantee that service providers and enterprises will understand the benefits we believe that our Smart Wi-Fi solutions provide. If another technology were found to be superior to Wi-Fi by service providers or enterprises, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. As a result, demand for our products and services may not continue to develop as we anticipate, or at all.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. The timing and size of sales of our products are highly variable and difficult to predict and can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue from period to period. This is particularly true of our sales to service providers, whose purchases are generally larger than those of our enterprise customers, causing greater variation in our results based on when service providers take delivery of our products.\nIn general, our product revenue reflects orders shipped in the same quarter that orders are received. In addition, we receive a substantial portion of our orders for each quarter in the last month of that quarter, which is a trend we expect to continue. We face risks of both under-estimating and over-estimating the amount and timing of orders from our customers. On the one hand, even though we may have business indicators about customer demand during a quarter, if we are unable to ship enough product to fulfill the orders we receive in the last month of each quarter, we would be forced to delay those shipments and the revenue associated with those orders. On the other hand, because our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations of future revenue, if the orders we receive in the last month of each quarter do not meet our expectations, we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough to compensate for the unexpected revenue shortfall. A small shortfall in revenue could disproportionately and adversely affect our operating margin and operating results for a given quarter. In addition, we may incur unanticipated costs in connection with expediting orders which have exceeded our order forecasts. If any of these events were to occur, we would expect our results to be adversely affected, and we might fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control, including changing economic environments in the U.S., Europe, China and other regions, and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. In addition to other risks listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our products and services, including seasonal variations in certain enterprise sectors such as hospitality and education, where end-customers place orders most heavily in the second and third quarters;\n\u2022\nthe inherent complexity, length and associated unpredictability of our sales cycles for our products and services, particularly with respect to sales to service providers;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets for technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles;\n\u2022\ntechnical challenges in service providers\u2019 overall networks, unrelated to our products, which could delay adoption and installation of our products;\n\u2022\nchanging market conditions, including current and potential service provider consolidation;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including new entrants, or further consolidation;\n\u2022\nvariation in sales channels, product costs or mix of products sold;\n\u2022\nour contract manufacturers and component suppliers\u2019 ability to meet our product demand forecasts at acceptable prices, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and ship in a timely manner new products and product enhancements and anticipate future market demands that meet our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully expand the suite of products we sell to existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe potential need to record incremental inventory reserves for products that may become obsolete due to our new product introductions;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the components we purchase;\n\u2022\nany decision to increase or decrease operating expenses in response to changes in the marketplace or perceived marketplace opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe timing of litigation matters or disputes and any resulting settlements or judgments;\n\u2022\ngrowth in our headcount and other related costs incurred in our customer support organization;\n\u2022\nvolatility in our stock price, which may lead to higher stock compensation expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to derive benefits from our investments in sales, marketing, engineering or other activities; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic or political conditions in our domestic and international markets, in particular the restricted credit environment impacting the credit of our customers.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue and/or earnings forecasts we may provide.\nOur sales may be impacted as a result of changes in public funding of educational institutions.\nIn July 2014, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, issued the E-rate Modernization Order to approve an update to the E-rate program (also known as the Schools and Libraries Program of the Universal Service Fund), which resulted in a $2 billion increase over the next two years to E-rate\u2019s existing budget to support Wi-Fi within schools and libraries. As a result, in the education market, certain end-customers may delay purchasing decisions until the new rules are implemented or until these funds become available in future funding cycles.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, particularly to service providers, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nThe timing of our revenues is difficult to predict. Our sales efforts involve educating our potential end-customers and channel partners about the applications and benefits of our products and services, including the technical capabilities of our products. Service providers typically require long sales cycles, which generally range between one and three years, but can be longer. The sale to a large service provider usually begins with an evaluation, followed by one or more network trials, followed by vendor selection and contract negotiation and finally followed by installation, testing and deployment. Sales cycles for enterprises are typically less than 90 days. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, purchases of our products are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Moreover, the evolving nature of the market may lead prospective end-customers to postpone their purchasing decisions pending resolution of Wi-Fi or other standards or adoption of technology by others. Even if an end-customer makes a decision to purchase our products, there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase, which makes our revenue difficult to forecast. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized. Our operating results may therefore vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWith respect to service providers, sales have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, in addition to long sales cycles. Sales activity to service providers depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures, the availability of funding, and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic and business conditions in their country of operations. The nature of this sales activity to service providers can result in further fluctuations in our operating results from period to period. Orders from service providers could decline for many reasons unrelated to the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets, such as advances in competing technologies. Our service provider end-customers typically have long implementation cycles, require a broader range of services, and often require acceptance terms that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. Some of our current or prospective service provider end-customers have canceled or delayed and may in the future cancel or delay spending on the development or roll-out of capital and technology projects with us due to continuing economic uncertainty and, consequently, our financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected. Weakness in orders from service providers, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers, which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nThe growth rate in recent periods of our revenue, net income and margin may not be indicative of our future performance.\nYou should not consider the growth rate in our revenue, net income or margin in recent periods as indicative of our future performance. We do not expect to achieve similar revenue, net income or margin growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue, net income or margin for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue, net income or margin, or their rate of growth. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue, net income or margin, or growth of any of these financial measures, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to maintain profitability.\nOur large end-customers, particularly service providers, have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that could result in lower revenues and gross margins from such end-customers. The loss of a single large end-customer could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our end-customers are service providers or larger enterprises that have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. These end-customers may require us to develop additional product features, may require penalties for non-performance of certain obligations, such as delivery, outages or response time, and may have multi-vendor strategies. The leverage held by these large end-customers could result in lower revenues and gross margins. The loss of a single large end-customer could materially harm our business and operating results.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures from existing and new companies may harm our business, revenues, growth rates and market share. In addition, many of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater resources than we do, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nThe markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants. The markets are influenced by, among others, the following competitive factors:\n\u2022\nbrand awareness and reputation;\n\u2022\nprice and total cost of ownership;\n\u2022\nstrength and scale of sales and marketing efforts, professional services and customer support;\n\u2022\nproduct features, reliability and performance;\n\u2022\nincumbency of current provider, either for Wi-Fi products or other products;\n\u2022\nscalability of products;\n\u2022\nability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; and\n\u2022\nbreadth of product offerings.\nOur competitors include Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and Aruba Networks. We expect competition to continue to intensify in the future as other companies introduce new products into our markets. This competition could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which would likely seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition. If we do not keep pace with product and technology advances, there could be a material and adverse effect on our competitive position, revenues and prospects for growth.\nA number of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to anticipate, influence or adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily and develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we can. In addition, certain competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with customers based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products, including through selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling or closed technology platforms. Potential end-customers may prefer to purchase all of their equipment from a single provider, or may prefer to purchase wireless networking products from an existing supplier rather than a new supplier, regardless of product performance or features.\nWe expect increased competition from our current competitors, as well as other established and emerging companies, to the extent our markets continue to develop and expand. Conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors. Some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they individually had offered. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies enter into partnerships or are acquired. The companies resulting from these possible consolidations may create more compelling product offerings and be able to offer greater pricing flexibility, making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or product functionality. Continued industry consolidation may adversely impact customers\u2019 perceptions of the viability of smaller and even medium-sized technology companies such as us and, consequently, customers\u2019 willingness to purchase from such companies. These pressures could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe compete in rapidly evolving markets and depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products. If we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and our customers\u2019 changing needs, we may not be able to remain competitive.\nThe Wi-Fi and wireless networking market is generally characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing end-customer needs, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services. To succeed, we must effectively anticipate, and adapt in a timely manner to, end-customer requirements and continue to develop or acquire new products and features that meet market demands, technology trends and regulatory requirements. Likewise, if our competitors introduce new products and services that compete with ours, we may be required to reposition our product and service offerings or introduce new products and services in response to such competitive pressure. If we fail to develop new products or product enhancements, or our end-customers or potential end-customers do not perceive our products to have compelling technical advantages, our business could be adversely affected, particularly if our competitors are able to introduce solutions with such increased functionality earlier than we do. Developing our products is expensive, complex and involves uncertainties. Each phase in the development of our products presents serious risks of failure, rework or delay, any one of which could impact the timing and cost-effective development of such product and could jeopardize end-customer acceptance of the product. We have experienced in the past and may in the future experience design, manufacturing, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements. In addition, the introduction of new or enhanced products requires that we carefully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering practices and ensure that new products can be timely delivered to meet our customers\u2019 demand. As a result, we may not be successful in modifying our current products or introducing new products in a timely or appropriately responsive manner, or at all. If we fail to address these changes successfully, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe base our inventory purchasing decisions on our forecasts of customers\u2019 demand, and if our forecasts are inaccurate, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe place orders with our manufacturers based on our forecasts of our customers\u2019 demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate, affecting our ability to provide products to our customers. When demand for our products increases significantly, we may not be able to meet demand on a timely basis, and we may need to expend a significant amount of time working with our customers to allocate limited supply and maintain positive customer relations, or we may incur additional costs in order to rush the manufacture and delivery of additional products. If we underestimate customers\u2019 demand, we may forego revenue opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we may purchase more inventory than we are able to sell at any given time or at all. In addition, we grant our distributors stock rotation rights, which require us to accept stock back from a distributor\u2019s inventory, including obsolete inventory. As a result of our failure to estimate demand for our products, and our distributor\u2019s stock rotation rights, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, resulting in a decline in the value of our inventory, which would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our liquidity. Our failure to accurately manage inventory relative to demand would adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth and expand our operations successfully, our business and operating results will be harmed and our reputation may be damaged.\nWe have expanded our operations significantly since inception and anticipate that further significant expansion will be required to achieve our business objectives. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings places a continuous and significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. Any such future growth would also add complexity to and require effective coordination throughout our organization.\nTo manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. We may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner, which could result in additional operating inefficiencies and could cause our costs to increase more than planned. If we do increase our operating expenses in anticipation of the growth of our business and this growth does not meet our expectations, our operating results may be negatively impacted. If we are unable to manage future expansion, our ability to provide high quality products and services could be harmed, which could damage our reputation and brand and may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSome of the components and technologies used in our products are purchased from a single source or a limited number of sources. The loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional transition costs, result in delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products, or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory and could cause us to redesign our products.\nAlthough supplies of our components are generally available from a variety of sources, we currently depend on a single source or limited number of sources for several components for our products. We have also entered into license agreements with some of our suppliers for technologies that are used in our products, and the termination of these licenses, which can generally be done on relatively short notice, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, we purchase standard Wi-Fi chipsets only from Qualcomm and our products incorporate certain technology that we license from Qualcomm. If that license agreement were terminated, we would be required to redesign some of our products in order to incorporate technology from alternative sources, and any such termination of the license agreement and redesign of certain of our products could require additional licenses and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nBecause there are no other sources identical to several of our components and technologies, if we lost any of these licenses or the ability to use any of these components from these suppliers, we could be required to transition to a new supplier or licensor, which could increase our costs, result in delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory. Additionally, poor quality in any of the sole-sourced components in our products could result in lost sales or lost sales opportunities. If the quality of the components does not meet our or our customers\u2019 requirements, if we are unable to obtain components from our existing suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or if any of our sole source providers cease to remain in business or continue to manufacture such components, we could be required to redesign our products in order to incorporate components or technologies from alternative sources. The resulting stoppage or delay in selling our products and the expense of redesigning our products could result in lost sales opportunities and damage to customer relationships, which would adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nIn addition, for certain components for which there are multiple sources, we are subject to potential price increases and limited availability due to market demand for such components. In the past, unexpected demand for communication products caused worldwide shortages of certain electronic parts. If such shortages occur in the future and we are unable to pass component price increases along to our customers or maintain stable or competitive pricing, our gross margins and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nBecause we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, our ability to supply products to our customers may be disrupted.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to third-party manufacturers. Our reliance on these third-party manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, and product supply and timing. Any manufacturing disruption by these third-party manufacturers could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders. Our reliance on outsourced manufacturers also yields the potential for infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third-party manufacturers effectively, or if these third-party manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions for any reason, experience increased manufacturing lead-times, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship products to our customers would be severely impaired, and our business and operating results would be seriously harmed.\nThese manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders. We do not have long term contracts with our third-party manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits. Accordingly, our third-party manufacturers are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements, which could result in supply shortages, and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. In addition, as a result of fluctuating global financial market conditions, natural disasters or other causes, it is possible that any of our manufacturers could experience interruptions in production, cease operations or alter our current arrangements. If our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes, we will be required to identify one or more acceptable alternative manufacturers. It is time-consuming and costly and could be impractical to begin to use new manufacturers, and changes in our third-party manufacturers may cause significant interruptions in supply if the new manufacturers have difficulty manufacturing products to our specification. As a result, our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales to existing or potential customers, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs. Any production interruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic, capacity shortages or quality problems, at one of our manufacturers would negatively affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturer and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nNew regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we adhere to certain reporting and other requirements regarding the use of certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d regardless of their actual country of origin) in our products. Some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices, including our products. These requirements require that we investigate, disclose and report whether or not any such metals in our products originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We have an extremely complex supply chain, with numerous suppliers, many of whom may not be obligated to investigate their own supply chains, for the components and parts used in each of our products. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products and other potential changes to products or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Because these regulations are new, we and the companies comprising our supply chain, both have a limited history of investigating, disclosing and reporting use of these minerals, and there is a limited history of regulatory guidance regarding compliance with these requirements. In addition, because our supply chain is so complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our business reputation. We may incur reputational challenges if we determine that any of our products contain minerals or derivative metals that are not conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the source for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement. Furthermore, key components and parts that can be shown to be \u201cconflict free\u201d may not be available to us in sufficient quantity, or at all, or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe rely significantly on channel partners to sell and support our products, and the failure of this channel to be effective could materially reduce our revenue.\nThe majority of our sales are through channel partners. We believe that establishing and maintaining successful relationships with these channel partners is, and will continue to be, important to our financial success. Recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our technology and product offerings require significant time and resources. To develop and expand our channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel partners, including investment in systems and training.\nExisting and future channel partners will only work with us if we are able to provide them with competitive products on terms that are commercially reasonable to them. If we fail to maintain the quality of our products or to update and enhance them, existing and future channel partners may elect to work instead with one or more of our competitors. In addition, the terms of our arrangements with our channel partners must be commercially reasonable for both parties. If we are unable to reach agreements that are beneficial to both parties, then our channel partner relationships will not succeed.\nWe have no minimum purchase commitments with any of our channel partners, and our contracts with channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours, including products they currently offer or may develop in the future and incorporate into their own systems. Some of our competitors may have stronger relationships with our channel partners than we do and we have limited control, if any, as to whether those partners use our products, rather than our competitors\u2019 products, or whether they devote resources to market and support our competitors\u2019 products, rather than our offerings. We cannot be certain that any of our channel partners, including our major distributors, will continue to sell our products or services at the same volumes as they have in the past, or will not terminate their agreements with us, which are generally terminable with certain notice.\nThe reduction in or loss of sales by these channel partners could materially reduce our revenue. If we fail to maintain relationships with our channel partners, fail to develop new relationships with other channel partners in new markets, fail to manage, train or incentivize existing channel partners effectively, fail to provide channel partners with competitive products on terms acceptable to them, or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts, our revenue may decrease and our operating results could suffer.\nOur ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings, and our failure to offer high quality support and services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOnce our products are deployed, our channel partners and end-customers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our products. A high level of support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our products. In many cases, our channel partners provide support directly to our end-customers. We do not have complete control over the level or quality of support provided by our channel partners. These channel partners may also provide support for other third-party products, which may potentially distract resources from support for our products. If we and our channel partners do not effectively assist our end-customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our end-customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support, it would adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end-customers and could harm our reputation with potential end-customers. In some cases, we guarantee a certain level of performance to our channel partners and end-customers, which could prove to be resource-intensive and expensive for us to fulfill if unforeseen technical problems were to arise.\nMany of our service provider and large enterprise end-customers have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than our smaller end-customers. We continue to expand our support organization for service provider and large enterprise end-customers. To meet the expanding need for support, we often rely on third parties to provide additional resources and support to end-customers on our behalf. If we fail to build this organization quickly enough, or it fails to meet the requirements of our service provider or large enterprise end-customers, or we fail to manage these third party resources appropriately, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our sales to large end-customers. In addition, given the extent of our international operations, our support organization faces challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. As a result of all of these factors, our failure to maintain high quality support and services would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe loss of key personnel or an inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel may impair our ability to expand our business.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management team and key technical, marketing and production personnel, including Selina Lo, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our employees, including our senior management team, are at-will employees, and therefore may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. The replacement of any members of our senior management team or other key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nOur future success also depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel. Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our common stock. Any failure to successfully attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs may negatively impact our growth. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from our competitors, we may be subject to allegations that these new hires have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product.\nOur products incorporate complex technology and may contain defects or errors. We may become subject to warranty claims, product returns, product liability and product recalls as a result, any of which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur products incorporate complex technology and must operate with cellular networks and a significant number and range of mobile devices using Wi-Fi, while supporting new and complex applications in a variety of environments that utilize different Wi-Fi communication industry standards. Our products have contained, and may contain in the future, undetected defects or errors. Some errors in our products have been and may in the future only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by end-customers. These issues are most prevalent when new products are introduced into the market. Defects or errors have delayed and may in the future delay the introduction of our new products. Since our products contain components that we purchase from third parties, we also expect our products to contain latent defects and errors from time to time related to those third-party components.\nAdditionally, defects and errors may cause our products to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure networks or temporarily interrupt end-customers\u2019 networking traffic. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, our products and third-party security products may be unable to anticipate these techniques and provide a solution in time to protect our end-customers\u2019 networks. In addition, defects or errors in the mechanism by which we provide software updates for our products could result in an inability to update end-customers\u2019 hardware products and thereby leave our end-customers vulnerable to attacks.\nReal or perceived defects or errors in our products could result in claims by channel partners and end-customers for losses that they sustain, including potentially losses resulting from security breaches of our end-customers\u2019 networks and/or downtime of those networks. If channel partners or end-customers make these types of claims, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem, including warranty and repair costs, process management costs and costs associated with remanufacturing our inventory. Liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from claims and related liabilities and costs. In addition, regardless of the party at fault, errors of these kinds divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, damage our reputation and the reputation of our products, cause significant customer relations problems and can result in product liability claims. We maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management\u2019s time and other resources. We also may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one or more of our products. The process of identifying recalled products that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and significant harm to our reputation. The occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our products do not interoperate with cellular networks and mobile devices, future sales of our products could be negatively affected.\nOur products are designed to interoperate with cellular networks and mobile devices using Wi-Fi technology. These networks and devices have varied and complex specifications. As a result, we must attempt to ensure that our products interoperate effectively with these existing and planned networks and devices. To meet these requirements, we must continue to undertake development and testing efforts that require significant capital and employee resources. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or cost-effectively, or at all. If our products do not interoperate effectively, orders for our products could be delayed or cancelled, which would harm our revenue, operating results and our reputation, potentially resulting in the loss of existing and potential end-customers. The failure of our products to interoperate effectively with cellular networks or mobile devices may result in significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. In addition, our end-customers may require our products to comply with new and rapidly evolving security or other certifications and standards. If our products are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, such end-customers may not purchase our products, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAlthough certain technical problems experienced by users may not be caused by our products, our business and reputation may be harmed if users perceive our solution as the cause of a slow or unreliable network connection, or a high profile network failure.\nOur products have been deployed in many different locations and user environments and are capable of providing connectivity to many different types of Wi-Fi-enabled devices operating a variety of applications. The ability of our products to operate effectively can be negatively impacted by many different elements unrelated to our products. For example, a user\u2019s experience may suffer from an incorrect setting in a Wi-Fi device. Although certain technical problems experienced by users may not be caused by our products, users often may perceive the underlying cause to be a result of poor performance of the wireless network. This perception, even if incorrect, could harm our business and reputation. Similarly, a high profile network failure may be caused by improper operation of the network or failure of a network component that we did not supply, but other service providers may perceive that our products were implicated, which, even if incorrect, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture, especially as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, passion for customers, and focus on execution, as well as facilitating critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing. As we grow and change, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.\nOur business, operating results and growth rates may be adversely affected by current or future unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for wireless network technology and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective end-customers to make those capital commitments necessary to purchase our products. If the conditions in the U.S. and global economies are uncertain or volatile, or if they deteriorate, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Economic weakness, end-customer financial difficulties, limited availability of credit and constrained capital spending have resulted, and may in the future result, in challenging and delayed sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition, and could negatively impact our ability to forecast future periods, which could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share.\nIn particular, we cannot be assured of the level of spending on wireless network technology, the deterioration of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and growth rates. The purchase of our products or willingness to replace existing infrastructure is discretionary and highly dependent on a perception of continued rapid growth in consumer usage of mobile devices and in many cases involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources. Therefore, weak economic conditions or a reduction in capital spending would likely adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. A reduction in spending on wireless network technology could occur or persist even if economic conditions improve.\nIn addition, if interest rates rise or foreign exchange rates weaken for our international customers, overall demand for our products and services could decline and related capital spending may be reduced. Furthermore, any increase in worldwide commodity prices may result in higher component prices for us and increased shipping costs, both of which may negatively impact our financial results.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued accounting standards update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of any such change. Any difficulties in the implementation of these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline. In addition, the SEC has announced a multi-year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of International Financial Reporting Standards by U.S. issuers in their SEC filings. Any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.\nIf our assumptions or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below expectations of financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, goodwill and intangible asset valuation, accounting for income taxes, stock-based compensation and warranty liability.\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn the course of our sales to customers, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable. Economic conditions or other factors may impact some of our customers' ability to pay their accounts payables, including customers who are unable to collect or experience delays in payment from their own customers. We derive a significant portion of our revenue through distributors and in many cases sales in one or more countries or regions are via a single distributor, which can result in a concentrated credit risk if such country or region has experienced active sales. While we monitor these situations carefully and take appropriate measures to collect accounts receivable balances, we have written down accounts receivable and written off doubtful accounts in prior periods and may be unable to avoid accounts receivable write-downs or write-offs of doubtful accounts in the future. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results.\nU.S. and global political, credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact or impair the value of our current portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments, including money market funds, corporate debt securities and U.S. government agency securities. As a result of the uncertain domestic and global political, credit and financial market conditions, investments in these types of financial instruments pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns. Given that future deterioration in the U.S. and global credit and financial markets is a possibility, no assurance can be made that losses or significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not occur. These factors could impact the liquidity or valuation of our current portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If any such losses or significant deteriorations occur, it may negatively impact or impair our current portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which may affect our ability to fund future obligations. Further, if there is a U.S. and global political, credit and financial market crisis, it may be difficult for us to liquidate our investments prior to their maturity without incurring a loss, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as network security breaches, computer software or system errors or viruses, or terrorism.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and many of our development center and contract manufacturers are located in eastern Asia, both regions known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire or a flood, occurring near our headquarters, or near the facilities of our contract manufacturers, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, our support operations are largely concentrated in a single location in India. A natural disaster in this location could have a material adverse impact on our support operations. In addition, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war could cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses, our suppliers\u2019 or manufacturers\u2019 operations or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to operate our business and to communicate among our workforce and with third parties. For example, we use business management and communication software products provided by third parties, such as Microsoft Online, SAP and salesforce.com, and security flaws or outages in such products would adversely affect our operations. Any disruption to these systems, whether caused by a natural disaster or by manmade problems, such as power disruptions, could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or impede our suppliers\u2019 and/or our manufacturers\u2019 ability to timely deliver our products and product components, or the deployment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, and cyber-attacks on our systems or solutions could compromise our proprietary information, or information of our customers, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our solutions, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer, create additional liabilities and have a material adverse impact on our financial results and stock price.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data that may include any of the following categories of information on our internal systems, networks and servers:\n\u2022\nintellectual property;\n\u2022\nour proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and\n\u2022\ncustomer and end-user data, which may include personally identifiable information and location-based data.\nAdditionally, we design and sell solutions that allow our customers to wirelessly access sensitive data on their own systems and to remotely manage and operate networks and applications that contain, transmit and store a variety of information. Our solutions incorporate complex technology and must operate and support a wide range of mobile devices that use Wi-Fi as well as the complex applications that run on those devices, which use multiple communication industry standards. In addition, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers, including personal information, has been increasing.\nThe secure maintenance of sensitive information on our own networks and the intrusion protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy. We devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. For example, we use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent third party access to data or accounts, but these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. If a third party were to fraudulently induce an employee or customer into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, or otherwise illicitly obtain that type of information, that information may in turn be used to access our IT systems and the data located there.\nIncreasingly, companies are facing a wide variety of attacks from computer \u201chackers\u201d who develop and deploy destructive software programs, such as viruses and worms, to attack networks. Due to our business model and the location of some of our development centers, we have faced and are likely to face similar threats that target both our internal systems and our solutions, which, in turn, may threaten our customers' networks, devices, applications and data. Because the techniques used by hackers to access or sabotage networks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, even with the significant efforts we take to create security barriers to such attacks, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk.\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions, any destructive or intrusive breach of our internal systems could compromise our networks, creating system disruptions or slowdowns, and the information stored on our networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Additionally, an effective attack on our solutions could disrupt the proper functioning of our solutions, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers, disrupt or temporarily interrupt customers' networking traffic, or cause other destructive outcomes, including the theft of information sufficient to engage in fraudulent financial transactions. If any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were to be unable to protect sensitive data, our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged, our reputation and brand could be materially harmed, use of our solutions could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. In addition, incidents involving unauthorized access to or improper use of user information or incidents involving violation of our terms of service or policies could cause government authorities to initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with such incidents, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based solutions we offer, and operate in more countries.\nReal or perceived defects or errors in our solutions, particularly in our cloud-based offerings which are sometimes perceived as being inherently less secure, could result in claims by channel partners and end-customers for losses that they sustain, including potentially losses resulting from security breaches of our systems, our end-customers' networks and/or downtime of those networks. If channel partners or end-customers make these types of claims, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of one of our solutions, particularly our cloud-based offerings, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our solutions, the market perception of the effectiveness of our solutions could be harmed and could impact our business, operating results and financial condition. The economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, viruses, worms, malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker, which are often difficult to identify.\nBecause of the nature of information that may pass through or be stored on our systems, we are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters and violations of these complex and dynamic laws, rules and regulations may result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased costs of operations, and/or other harms to our business.\nThere has been an increase in laws in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere imposing requirements for the handling of personal data, including data of employees, consumers and business contacts as well as privacy-related matters. For example, the State of California has adopted legislation requiring operators of commercial websites and mobile applications that collect personal information from California residents to conspicuously post and comply with privacy policies that satisfy certain requirements. Several other U.S. states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security of personal information that they collect from consumers over the Internet, and more states may adopt similar legislation in the future. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the U.S. The European Union has adopted various directives regulating data privacy and security and the transmission of content using the Internet involving residents of the European Union, including those directives known as the Data Protection Directive, the E-Privacy Directive, and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive, and may adopt similar directives in the future. The European Commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and that may also include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries are considering legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that, if enacted, could increase the cost and complexity of selling our solutions or maintaining our business operations in those jurisdictions. The introduction of new solutions or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which can be enforced by private parties or government entities, are constantly evolving. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices and may be contradictory with each other. For example, a government entity in one jurisdiction may demand the transfer of information forbidden from transfer by a government entity in another jurisdiction. If our actions were determined to be in violation of any of these disparate laws and regulations, in addition to the possibility of fines, we could be ordered to change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and financial condition.\nThese existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new solutions, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices. In addition, there is a risk that failures in systems designed to protect private, personal or proprietary data held by us will allow such data to be disclosed to or seen by others, resulting in application of regulatory penalties, enforcement actions, remediation obligations and/or private litigation by parties whose data were improperly disclosed. There is also a risk that we, directly or as the result of some third-party service provider we use, could be found to have failed to comply with the laws or regulations of some country regarding the collection, consent, handling, transfer, or disposal of such personal data, which could subject us to fines or other sanctions, as well as adverse reputational impact.\nNew regulations or standards, or changes in existing regulations or standards, or newly issued interpretations or enforcement of such regulations or standards, in the United States or internationally related to our products may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and future sales, and could place additional burdens on the operations of our business.\nOur products are subject to governmental regulations in a variety of jurisdictions. In order to achieve and maintain market acceptance, our products must continue to comply with these regulations as well as a significant number of industry standards. In the United States, our products must comply with various regulations defined by the FCC, Underwriters Laboratories and others. We must also comply with similar international regulations. For example, our wireless communication products operate through the transmission of radio signals, and radio emissions are subject to regulation in the United States and in other countries in which we do business. In the United States, various federal agencies including the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration, the FCC, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various state agencies have promulgated regulations that concern the use of radio/electromagnetic emissions standards. Member countries of the European Union have enacted similar standards concerning electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility and emissions, and chemical substances and use standards.\nAs these regulations and standards evolve, and if new regulations or standards are implemented, we will be required to modify our products or develop and support new versions of our products, and our compliance with these regulations and standards may become more burdensome. The failure of our products to comply, or delays in compliance, with the various existing and evolving industry regulations and standards could prevent or delay introduction of our products, which could harm our business. End-customer uncertainty regarding future policies may also affect demand for communications products, including our products. If existing laws or regulations regarding the use of our products or services are enforced in a manner not contemplated by our end-customers, it could expose them or us to liability and could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, channel partners or end-customers may require us, or we may otherwise deem it necessary or advisable, to alter our products to address actual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment. Our inability to alter our products to address these requirements and any regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are evaluating and may adopt a corporate structure more closely aligned with the international nature of our business activities, which will require us to incur expenses but could fail to achieve the intended benefits.\nWe are considering reorganizing our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. This proposed corporate structure may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate through changes in how we use our intellectual property, international procurement, and sales operations. This proposed corporate structure may also allow us to achieve financial and operational efficiencies. These efforts will require us to incur expenses in the near term for which we may not realize related benefits. If the intended structure is not accepted by the applicable taxing authorities or changes in domestic and international tax laws negatively impact the proposed structure, including proposed legislation to reform U.S. taxation of international business activities, or we do not operate our business consistent with the proposed structure and applicable tax provisions, we may fail to achieve the financial and operational efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the proposed structure and our future financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nOur international operations expose us to additional business risks and failure to manage these risks may adversely affect our international revenue.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers outside the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 51%, 55% and 57% of our revenue, respectively, was attributable to our international customers. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 55% of our full-time employees were located abroad. We expect that our international activities will be dynamic over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets, which will require significant management attention and financial resources. Therefore, we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations.\nAs we expand the marketing, selling, and supporting of our products and services internationally, we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. To the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, and retaining an international staff, and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel, we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets. In addition, business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the United States and may require us to include non-standard terms in customer contracts, such as extended payment or warranty terms. To the extent that we may enter into contracts with our international customers in the future that include non-standard terms related to payment, warranties or performance obligations, our operating results may be adversely impacted. International operations are subject to other inherent risks and our future results could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\nrequirements or preferences for domestic products, which could reduce demand for our products;\n\u2022\ndiffering technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required product features and functionality;\n\u2022\nmanagement communication and integration problems related to entering new markets with different languages, cultures and political systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, and irregularities in, financial statements;\n\u2022\nimproper or illegal activities of third party agents or consultants purporting to act on our behalf;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including regulatory requirements regarding our ability to repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022\nadded legal compliance obligations and complexity;\n\u2022\nthe increased cost of terminating employees in some countries; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and terrorism.\nTo the extent we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and manage effectively these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not successfully sell our products in certain geographic markets or develop and manage new sales channels in accordance with our business plan.\nWe expect to continue to sell our products to a broader customer base, including certain geographic markets where we do not have significant current business. To succeed in certain of these markets, we believe we will need to develop and manage new sales channels and distribution arrangements. We may not be successful in developing and managing such channels, in further penetrating certain geographic regions, or reaching a broader customer base. Failure to develop or manage additional sales channels effectively would limit our ability to succeed in these markets and could adversely affect our ability to grow our customer base and revenue.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\nTo date, substantially all of our international sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars; however, most of our expenses associated with our international operations are denominated in local currencies. As a result, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the value of these local currencies could have a material adverse effect on the gross margins and profitability of our international operations. Conversely, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the value of these local currencies results in our products being more expensive to potential customers and could have an adverse impact on our pricing or our ability to sell our products internationally. To date, we have not used risk management techniques to hedge the risks associated with these fluctuations. Even if we were to implement hedging strategies, not every exposure can be hedged and, where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign currency exchange exposure, they are based on forecasts that may vary or that may later prove to have been inaccurate. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or our failure to successfully hedge against these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nA significant portion of our revenues is and will be from jurisdictions outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of directing, obtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA applies to companies and individuals alike, including company directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. In addition, the government may seek to rely on a theory of successor liability and hold us responsible for FCPA violations committed by companies or associated with assets which we acquire.\nIn many foreign countries where we operate, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other similar laws and regulations. In contrast, we have implemented a company policy requiring our employees and consultants to comply with the FCPA and similar laws. We have conducted mandatory formal FCPA compliance training for all of our full time employees. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that our employees, partners and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of the FCPA or our policies for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As a result of our rapid growth, our infrastructure to identify FCPA matters and monitor compliance is developing. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial conditions. We may also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of our export privileges.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur products and solutions are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our products and solutions must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers, and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if our channel partners, agents or consultants fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, or make sales into restricted jurisdictions, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Changes in our products or solutions or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may also create delays in the introduction and sale of our products and solutions in international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products and solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products and solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws and regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such laws and regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products and solutions to existing or potential end-customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products and solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products and solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products and solutions. Various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and solutions or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products and solutions in those countries. Encryption products and solutions and the underlying technology may also be subject to export control restrictions. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products and solutions, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenues. Compliance with applicable regulatory laws and regulations regarding the export of our products and solutions, including with respect to new releases of our solutions, may create delays in the introduction of our products and solutions in international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products and solutions throughout their globally-distributed systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products and solutions to some countries altogether. U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions programs also prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons that are subject to U.S. economic embargoes and trade sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products and solutions from being shipped or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our products and solutions could be shipped to those targets or provided by third-parties despite such precautions. Any such shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Furthermore, any new embargo or sanctions program, or any change in the countries, governments, persons or activities targeted by such programs, could result in decreased use of our products and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products and solutions to existing or potential end-customers, which would likely adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We are subject to claims and litigation by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights and we expect claims and litigation with respect to infringement to occur in the future. As our business expands and the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, we expect that infringement claims may increase in number and significance. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time or result in the diversion of significant operational resources, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIntellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. In addition, we currently have a limited portfolio of issued patents compared to our larger competitors, and therefore may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, we are subject to claims and litigation brought by patent assertion companies and other non-practicing entities who have no relevant products or revenues and against whom our patents provide no deterrence. Such claims distract resources and require us to incur significant litigation expenses to defend or to pay significant sums in settlement to avoid the costs of litigation even when such claims are not meritorious. Furthermore, many potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. In addition to incurring litigation and settlement costs, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services. We might also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We protect our proprietary information and technology through licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries. There can be no assurance that these protections will be available in all cases or will be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying, reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our technology, proprietary rights or products. The laws of some foreign countries, including countries in which our products are sold or manufactured, are in many cases not as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. In addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, or applications for any of the foregoing. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. We have focused patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection primarily in the United States, China, Taiwan and Europe. As a result, we may not have sufficient protection of our intellectual property in all countries where infringement may occur. In each case, our ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nTo prevent substantial unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement and/or misappropriation of our proprietary rights against third parties, including previous employees that misappropriate our proprietary information upon departure from our company. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management\u2019s attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe are generally obligated to indemnify our channel partners and end-customers for certain expenses and liabilities resulting from intellectual property infringement claims regarding our products, which could force us to incur substantial costs.\nWe have agreed, and expect to continue to agree, to indemnify our channel partners and end-customers for certain intellectual property infringement claims regarding our products. As a result, in the case of infringement claims against these channel partners and end-customers, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund amounts they have paid to us. Some of our channel partners and end-customers have sought, and we expect that certain of our channel partners and end-customers in the future may seek, indemnification from us in connection with infringement claims brought against them. In addition, some of our channel partners and end-customers have tendered to us the defense of claims brought against them for infringement. We evaluate each such request on a case-by-case basis and we may not succeed in refuting all such claims. If a channel partner or end-customer elects to invest resources in enforcing a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face substantial liability.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses. If these licenses are available to us only on less favorable terms or not at all in the future, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe have incorporated third-party licensed technology into our products. For example, our products incorporate certain technology that we license from Qualcomm. It may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek additional licenses for existing or new products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights, or to obtain those licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could result in delays in product releases until such time, if ever, as equivalent technology could be identified, licensed or developed and integrated into our products and might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur products contain software modules licensed for use from third-party authors under open source licenses, such as Linux and Cassandra. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time, and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated, and is likely to continue to fluctuate, substantially. The trading price of our common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance.\nSince shares of our common stock were sold at our initial public offering in November 2012 at a price of $15.00 per share, our stock price has ranged as low as $8.65 and as high as $26.50 through December 31, 2014. Factors that may have and could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the market prices and trading volumes of high technology stocks;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders, including our officers, directors and other holders of a significant percentage of our shares;\n\u2022\nfailure of financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nany major change in our management;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of particular companies\u2019 securities, securities class action litigations have often been instituted against these companies. Litigation of this type, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nInsiders continue to have substantial influence over us, which could limit a stockholder's ability to affect the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our directors, executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 12.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly since we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d at the end of 2013. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nAs a public company that is subject to these rules and regulations, we may find that it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers.\nWe may acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may continue to make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete significant acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers, investors and financial analysts. In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock. The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain, and we may need to raise additional funds in the future. If we require additional funds in the future, those funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, need to raise substantial additional capital to:\n\u2022\nfund our operations;\n\u2022\ncontinue our research and development;\n\u2022\ndevelop and commercialize new products;\n\u2022\nacquire companies, in-licensed products or intellectual property; or\n\u2022\nexpand sales and marketing activities.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, claims that we infringe third-party patents or violate other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing additional technical support capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe market for different types of funding and overall economic conditions.\nWe may require additional funds in the future, and we may not be able to obtain those funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders.\nIf we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, or delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our development programs. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these actions could harm our operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investor confidence in our company may be adversely effected and, as a result, the value of our common stock may decline.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls for financial reporting in the future, or if our auditors are unable to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or determine we have a material weakness in our internal controls, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf financial or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. We may not attract sufficient research coverage or maintain coverage of analysts that currently publish reports regarding our business. Additionally, the analysts who publish information about our common stock have had relatively little experience with our company, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. In the event we obtain industry or financial analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our board or directors or management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nour board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nour stockholders may not act by written consent or call special stockholders\u2019 meetings; as a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions other than at annual stockholders\u2019 meetings or special stockholders\u2019 meetings called by the board of directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the president;\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nstockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and\n\u2022\nour board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock; the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nCertain of our executive officers or directors may be entitled to accelerated vesting of their stock options pursuant to the terms of their employment arrangements or option grants upon a change of control of the Company. In addition to the arrangements currently in place with some of our executive officers, we may enter into similar arrangements in the future with other officers. Such arrangements could delay or discourage a potential acquisition of the Company.", "PERMNO": 13690, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "RKUS"}
