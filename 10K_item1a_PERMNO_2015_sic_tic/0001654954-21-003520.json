RISK FACTORS\nThe risks below are those that we believe are the material risks that we currently face, but are not the only risks facing us and our business. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Below is a summary of our risk factors with a more detailed discussion following.\n\u25cf\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has and may continue to negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nWe have had a history of losses, which may continue as we expand our selling efforts.\n\u25cf\nOur revenue growth for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in forecast revenues may harm our operating results.\n\u25cf\nOur current comprehensive wound and skin care strategy involves growth through acquisitions and investments, which requires us to incur substantial costs and potential liabilities for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits.\n\u25cf\nIf we cannot meet our future capital requirements, our business will suffer.\n\u25cf\nFailure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\n\u25cf\nFailure to manage our growth strategy could harm our business.\n\u25cf\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from large, well-established medical device manufacturers and telehealth providers as well as new market entrants, and if we are unable to compete within our markets or our products and services do not gain market acceptance, our operating results and financial condition could suffer.\n\u25cf\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\n\u25cf\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and our business may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely impacted.\n\u25cf\nThe Loan Agreement governing our revolving line of credit includes restrictive terms, and our failure to comply with any of these terms could result in a default, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf\nWe rely on our research and development partners to design, manufacture and supply the products we have licensed for marketing.\n\u25cf\nOur future success will largely depend on our ability to maintain and further grow clinical acceptance and adoption of our products, and we may be unable to adequately educate healthcare practitioners on the use and benefits of our products.\n\u25cf\nCompetitors could invent products superior to ours and cause our products and technologies to become obsolete.\n\u25cf\nDisruption of, or changes in, our distribution model or customer base could harm our sales and margins.\n\u25cf\nIf we are unable to manage product inventory in an effective manner, our profitability could be impaired.\n\u25cf\nFailure of any third-party assessments to demonstrate desired outcomes in proposed endpoints may result in adverse regulatory actions, reduce physician usage or adoption of our products, or reduce the price, coverage and/or reimbursement for our products, which could have a negative impact on our business performance.\n\u25cf\nWe may have exposure to product liability claims.\n\u25cf\nInterruptions in the supply of our products or inventory loss may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nOur planned expansion into wound and skin care virtual consult and other services will require entrance into several markets in which we have little or no experience and is dependent on our relationships with affiliated professional entities to provide physician services.\n\u25cf\nRecent and frequent state legislative and regulatory changes specific to telemedicine may present us with additional requirements and state compliance costs, with potential operational impacts in certain jurisdictions.\n\u25cf\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to compete effectively.\n\u25cf\nCellerateRX Surgical no longer has patent protection. Accordingly, CellerateRX Surgical may be subject to competition from the sale of substantially equivalent products that could adversely affect our business and operations.\n\u25cf\nWe are heavily dependent on technologies and products we have licensed from third parties, and we may need to license technologies and products in the future, and if we fail to obtain licenses we need, or fail to comply with our payment obligations in the agreements under which we in-license intellectual property and other rights from third parties, we could lose our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\n\u25cf\nWe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\n\u25cf\nOur business is affected by numerous regulations relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of our products.\n\u25cf\nDelays in or changes to the FDA clearance and approval processes or ongoing regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain FDA clearance or approval of new products or comply with ongoing requirements.\n\u25cf\nChanges in reimbursement policies and regulations by governmental or other third-party payors may have an adverse impact on the use of our products.\n\u25cf\nWe rely on our research and development partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to product classification and FDA marketing authorization.\n\u25cf\nWe and our employees and contractors are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including false claims laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\n\u25cf\nOur or our research and development partners\u2019 use and disclosure of personally identifiable information is subject to federal and state privacy and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nIf we fail to comply with extensive healthcare laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\n\u25cf\nOur officers, employees, independent contractors, principal investigators and commercial partners may engage in activities that are improper under other laws and regulations, which would create liability for us.\n\u25cf\nWe could be adversely affected if healthcare reform measures substantially change the market for medical care or healthcare coverage in the United States.\n\u25cf\nDefects, failures or quality issues associated with our products could lead to product recalls or safety alerts, adverse regulatory actions, litigation and negative publicity that could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nIt is possible that we will require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth.\n\u25cf\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock is highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\n\u25cf\nOur common stock does not have a vigorous trading market, and you may not be able to sell your securities at or near ask prices, or at all.\n\u25cf\nThe potential sale of large amounts of common stock may have a negative effect upon the market value of our shares.\n\u25cf\nA few of our existing shareholders own a large percentage of our voting stock and have control over matters requiring shareholder approval and may delay or prevent a change in control or otherwise lead to actual or potential conflicts of interest.\n\u25cf\nOur Certificate of Formation includes provisions limiting the personal liability of our directors for breaches of fiduciary duties under Texas law.\n\u25cf\nTexas law and our Certificate of Formation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that shareholders may consider favorable.\n\u25cf\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nRisks Related to How We Operate Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has and may continue to negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing in the United States and most of the world. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization declared a global emergency, and since that time governments have instituted measures to attempt to contain spread of the virus, including temporary limitations on non-essential business activities and elective surgical procedures in hospitals.\nA majority of our revenue is currently generated from the sale of products in connection with surgical procedures, and a significant portion of those sales are to hospitals. Beginning in March 2020, many states issued orders suspending elective surgeries in order to free-up hospital resources to treat COVID-19 patients. This resulted in a reduction in demand for our surgical products beginning in the second half of March 2020. Additionally, most states limited access to SNFs to only resident caregivers, which impeded our ability to provide education and product training to the clinicians who use our products in these facilities. These restrictions resulted in an overall decline in sales for the second quarter of 2020. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we saw a strong rebound in product sales as restrictions on elective surgeries eased in our primary markets in Texas, Florida, and the southeastern United States.\nThe extent to which these events impact our business will depend on future developments regarding the rate of infection of the virus and the further or lessening of current or new restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic.\nWe have had a history of losses, which may continue as we expand our selling efforts.\nWe have incurred net losses in most years since we began our current operations in 2004. We plan to continue making significant investments in our sales force and clinical programs, which substantially increase our operating expenses. Consequently, we will need to continue our revenue growth to become profitable in future periods. We cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to generate future sales growth. If we fail to achieve profitability, our stock price may decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nOur revenue growth for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in forecast revenues may harm our operating results.\nBecause we are a relatively small company, our revenue growth and, consequently, results of operations are difficult to predict. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations as we may not be able to quickly reduce our fixed expenses in response to short-term revenue shortfalls. We have experienced fluctuations in revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue until we achieve a critical mass with our product and service sales. These fluctuations can result from a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\neconomic conditions worldwide, as well as economic conditions specific to the healthcare industry, which could affect the ability of surgical and post-acute facilities to purchase our products and could result in a reduction in elective operative procedures;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental regulations, including those adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf\nthe uncertainty surrounding our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers;\n\u25cf\nchanges in reimbursement rates for our products by government and private insurers;\n\u25cf\nthe length and variability of our sales cycle, especially gaining approvals for the use of our products in additional hospitals and surgery centers, which makes it difficult to forecast the quarter in which our sales will occur;\n\u25cf\nissues including delays in the sourcing of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of operating expense relating to the expansion of our business and operations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the pricing of our products and those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe development of new wound care products or product enhancements by our competitors; and\n\u25cf\nactual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing from assumptions and estimates used in preparing our operating plan and how well we execute our strategy and operating plans.\nAs a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and prior results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur current comprehensive wound and skin care strategy involves growth through acquisitions and investments, which requires us to incur substantial costs and potential liabilities for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits.\nIn addition to internally generated growth, our current strategy to expand into wound and skin care virtual consult and other services involves growth through acquisitions and investments. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, we have made minority shareholder investments in two businesses at a total cost of approximately $1.1 million, and in February 2021, we made an additional $0.6 million investment in such businesses. In addition, in January 2021 we acquired WounDerm for aggregate consideration of 29,536 shares of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to continue implementing our growth strategy, and our strategy ultimately may be unsuccessful. We engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and investments and are in various stages of discussion regarding possible acquisitions, certain of which, if consummated, could be significant to us. Any new acquisition or investment could result in material transaction expenses, increased interest and amortization expense, increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, if we are unable to integrate businesses and operations that we acquire in the future, our profitability could suffer. These acquisitions and investments also involve other risks, including diversion of management resources otherwise available for the running of our business and the development of our business as well as risks associated with entering markets in which our marketing teams and sales force has limited experience or where experienced distribution alliances are not available. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates in the future, obtain acceptable financing or consummate any future acquisitions or investments. In addition, certain potential acquisitions may be subject to antitrust and competition laws, which could impact our ability to pursue strategic acquisitions and could result in mandated divestitures. If we are unsuccessful in our current strategy to expand into wound and skin care virtual consult and other services, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we cannot meet our future capital requirements, our business will suffer.\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow from operating activities, and future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, demand for our products and services, new product and service offerings from competitors, regulatory approval of our new products, technological change, and dependence on key personnel. Although we have taken steps to improve our overall liquidity, if our cash flow is insufficient, we may be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to:\n\u25cf\nfund operating losses;\n\u25cf\nincrease marketing to address the market for surgical, wound and skin care products and services;\n\u25cf\ntake advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion or acquisitions of complementary products or businesses;\n\u25cf\nhire, train and retain employees;\n\u25cf\ndevelop and/or distribute new products; and/or\n\u25cf\nrespond to economic and competitive pressures.\nIf our capital needs are met through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current shareholders may be reduced which may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock. Our future success may be determined in large part by our ability to obtain additional financing, and the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations which could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available or, if available, that such financing could be obtained upon terms acceptable to us. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, our operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nFailure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled executive, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. We compete for such personnel with other companies, some of which have greater financial resources than we do to recruit and retain personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find and attract additional qualified employees or retain any such executive officers and other key personnel. The inability to hire qualified personnel or the loss of services of our executive officers or key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, any inability on our part to enforce non-compete arrangements related to key personnel who have left our company or may leave our company in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to manage our growth strategy could harm our business.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and market and sell our surgical, wound and skin care products and services requires an effective plan for managing our future growth. We plan to increase the scope of our operations at a rapid rate. Future expansion efforts will be expensive and may strain our internal operating resources. To manage future growth effectively, we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations. If we do not manage growth properly, it could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from large, well-established medical device manufacturers and telehealth providers as well as new market entrants, and if we are unable to compete within our markets or our products and services do not gain market acceptance, our operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nCompetition from other medical device companies is significant and could be significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of market participants. We compete with other companies in acquiring rights to products or technologies from third-party developers. Although our products have performed well in customer evaluations, we are a relatively unknown brand in a market dominated by companies with extensive product lines and large customer bases. We may not, even with more efficacious products, be able to secure contracts and achieve significant growth with large national accounts.\nIn addition, if we launch our wound and skin care virtual consult and other service offerings, we will face competition from other telehealth providers. The public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the widespread adoption of telemedicine for most health care clinical specialties, including wound care and dermatology. As such, any clinical wound care or dermatology physician and/or provider group that has incorporated telemedicine into their practice could be considered competitive. If we are unable to compete with other telehealth providers, our operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nSeveral factors may limit the market acceptance of our products and services, including the timing of regulatory approvals and market entry relative to competitive products and services, the availability of alternative products and services, the price of our products and services relative to alternative products and services, the availability of third-party reimbursement and the extent of marketing efforts by third-party distributors or agents that we retain. There can be no assurance that our products or services will receive market acceptance in a commercially viable period of time, if at all. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can develop products and services that are more effective or achieve greater market acceptance than competitive products and services, or that our competitors will not succeed in developing or acquiring products and technologies that are more effective than those being developed by us, that would render our products and technologies less competitive or obsolete.\nOur competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nlarge and established distribution networks in the U.S. and/or in international markets;\n\u25cf\ngreater financial, managerial and other resources for products research and development, sales and marketing efforts and protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\ngreater name recognition;\n\u25cf\nlarger consumer bases;\n\u25cf\nmore expansive portfolios of products and intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf\ngreater experience in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and/or clearances from the FDA and other regulatory agencies.\nThe presence of competition in our market may lead to pricing pressure which would make it more difficult to sell our products and services at a profitable price or may prevent us from selling our products at all. Our failure to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we use networks to collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and important information of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in the loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, backlash from negative public relations, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Further, such access, disclosure or loss may cause disruption of our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage to our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have programs, processes and technologies in place to prevent, detect, contain, respond to and mitigate security related threats and potential incidents. We undertake considerable ongoing improvements to our systems, connected devices and information-sharing products in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and can be difficult to detect, anticipating, identifying or preventing these intrusions or mitigating them if and when they occur, may be challenging.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and our business may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely impacted.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or to prevent fraud could harm our business. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires management to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In order to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to continuously evaluate and, where appropriate, enhance our policies, procedures and internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, we could be subject to litigation or regulatory scrutiny and investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We cannot provide any assurance that in the future we will be able to fully comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or that management will conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we fail to fully comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our business may be harmed and our stock price may decline. In addition, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nFor instance, our assessment, testing and evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting resulted in our conclusion that as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to our small size and limited segregation of duties. As a result of such determination, we implemented additional controls, including the hiring of an additional full-time accounting professional in January 2020, which enabled us to properly segregate duties, and concluded that the material weakness was remediated as of June 30, 2020. While we have concluded that the material weakness has been remediated, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or if the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorate over time.\nThe Loan Agreement governing our revolving line of credit includes restrictive terms, and our failure to comply with any of these terms could result in a default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nOn January 15, 2021, we entered into a loan agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Cadence Bank, N.A. (\u201cCadence\u201d) that provides for a $2.5 million revolving line of credit. The Loan Agreement governing our revolving line of credit requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants, including, among others, a minimum liquidity of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, a minimum Tangible Net Worth (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of $1.0 million and, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of 1.5 to 1.0. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the Loan Agreement. If amounts owed under the Loan Agreement are accelerated because of a default and we are unable to pay such amounts, Cadence may have the right to assume control of substantially all of our assets.\nIf we are unable to refinance or repay amounts that we borrow under our revolving line of credit prior to its maturity date, our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of our debt and would not be available for operating our business. No assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nWe rely on our research and development partners to design, manufacture and supply the products we have licensed for marketing. If one of our partners fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, we may be required to incur significant costs. We may also face significant delays in our product introductions and commercialization.\nWe do not currently own any facility that may be used as a manufacturing and processing facility, and we rely on our research and development partners, from whom we license all of the products we currently commercialize, to design, manufacture and supply such products.\nOur research and development partners responsible for manufacturing our products and their contract manufacturers are obliged to operate in accordance with FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d), current good tissue practices (\u201ccGTP\u201d), and the Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), as applicable, as well as other regulations applicable to medical product manufacturers. The manufacture of regulated medical products in compliance with cGMP, cGTP, and the QSR, as applicable, requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including product stability and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced regulatory requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements and foreign regulations. If our research and development partners or their contract manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations, our ability to commercialize our products would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with applicable FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards at any time, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of regulated products. We have little control over the manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure of any of our current or future research and development partners or their contract manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP, cCTP, and the QSR, as applicable, and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in obtaining marketing authorization of future products or the ultimate launch of products. Failure by our current or future partners or manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could also result in sanctions being imposed on us or our partners, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant marketing authorization, delays, suspension or withdrawal of authorization, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to the manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. Any of these factors could cause a delay of commercialization of our products, entail higher costs or impair our reputation.\nOur future success will largely depend on our ability to maintain and further grow clinical acceptance and adoption of our products, and we may be unable to adequately educate healthcare practitioners on the use and benefits of our products.\nHealthcare practitioners play a significant role in determining the course of a patient\u2019s treatment and, ultimately, the type of products, if any, that will be used to treat the patient. As a result, our commercial success is heavily dependent on our ability to educate practitioners on the use of our products in both surgical and post-acute care settings. Acceptance and adoption of our products in our markets depends on educating healthcare practitioners as to the distinctive characteristics, benefits, safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our products, including potential comparisons to our competitors\u2019 products, and on training healthcare practitioners in the proper application of our products. If we are not successful in convincing healthcare practitioners of the merits and advantages of our products compared to our competitors\u2019 products, they may not use our products and we will be unable to increase our sales and sustain growth or profitability.\nConvincing healthcare practitioners to dedicate the time and energy necessary to properly train to use new products and techniques is challenging, and we may not be successful in these efforts. In particular, as healthcare resources are strained due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it may be more difficult to convince healthcare practitioners to commit their time and resources to learning to use a new product. If healthcare practitioners are not properly trained, they may use our products ineffectively, resulting in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, negative publicity or lawsuits against us. Accordingly, even if our products show superior benefits, safety or efficacy, based on head-to-head clinical trials, in comparison to alternative treatments, our success will depend on our ability to gain and maintain market acceptance for our products. If we fail to do so, our sales will not grow and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. We may not have adequate resources to effectively educate the medical community and our efforts may not be successful due to physician resistance or negative perceptions regarding our products.\nHealthcare practitioners may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u25cf\nlack or perceived lack of evidence supporting greater efficacy versus standard of care;\n\u25cf\nperceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u25cf\nlimited or lack of availability of coverage and reimbursement within healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf\nexisting sole-source supply contracts with purchasing entities, such as hospital systems and group purchasing organizations, that do not use our products;\n\u25cf\npressure to contain costs and use lower cost alternatives to our products; and\n\u25cf\nthe time commitment that may be required for training to use new products or technologies.\nCompetitors could invent products superior to ours and cause our products and technologies to become obsolete.\nThe wound care sector of the medical products industry is characterized by a multitude of technologies and intense competition. Our competitors currently manufacture and distribute a variety of products that are, in many respects, comparable to our products. Many suppliers of competing products are considerably larger and have much greater resources than we have. In addition, many specialized products companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of wound care products which may be competitive with ours. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and may commercialize wound care products on their own or through joint ventures. It is possible that these competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than any we currently have. If this occurs, any of our products and technology affected by these developments could become obsolete.\nDisruption of, or changes in, our distribution model or customer base could harm our sales and margins.\nIf we fail to manage the distribution of our products properly, or if the financial condition or operations of our reseller channels weaken, there may be a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, a change in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise, or a change in the mix of direct and indirect sales, could adversely affect our business.\nSeveral factors could also result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model or customer base, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following:\n\u25cf\nin some instances, we compete with some of our resellers through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not compete; and\n\u25cf\nsome of our resellers may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions.\nIf we are unable to manage product inventory in an effective and efficient manner, our profitability could be impaired.\nMany factors affect the efficient use and planning of product inventory, such as effectiveness of predicting demand, effectiveness of preparing manufacturing to meet demand, efficiently meeting product mix and product demand requirements and product expiration. Our products have a shelf life of between 18 months and three years. If we are unable to manage our product inventory efficiently or within expected budget goals, or keep sufficient finished and in-process product on hand to meet demand, our operating margins and long-term growth prospects could be impaired.\nWe place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of demand and, in some instances, may acquire additional inventory to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts are based on management\u2019s judgment and assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. If we overestimate customer demand, our excess or obsolete inventory may increase significantly, which would reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships.\nFailure of any third-party assessments to demonstrate desired outcomes in proposed endpoints may result in adverse regulatory actions, reduce physician usage or adoption of our products, or reduce the price, coverage and/or reimbursement for our products, which could have a negative impact on our business performance.\nOur collaborators regularly conduct clinical studies designed to test a variety of endpoints associated with product performance and use across a number of applications. If a clinical study conducted by our collaborators fails to demonstrate statistically significant results supporting performance, use benefits or compelling health economic outcomes from using our products, physicians may elect not to use our products as a treatment for conditions that may benefit from them. Furthermore, in the event of an adverse clinical study outcome, our products may not achieve \u201cstandard-of-care\u201d designations, where they exist, for the conditions in question, which could deter the adoption of our products. Also, if serious adverse events are reported during the conduct of a study, it could affect continuation of the study, product marketing authorization by regulatory authorities and product adoption by healthcare professionals or could cause regulatory authorities to impose other restrictions on the product or require additional warning or precaution statements to appear on the product labeling. If our collaborators are unable to develop a body of statistically significant evidence from our clinical studies, whether due to adverse results or the inability to complete properly designed studies, public and private payors could refuse to cover our products, limit the manner in which they cover our products, or reduce the price they are willing to pay or reimburse for our products.\nWe may have exposure to product liability claims.\nAlthough we have contractual indemnity from the manufacturers of our current products for certain liability claims related to their production, we could face a product liability claim outside of the scope of the contractual indemnities. We do not have, and do not anticipate obtaining, contractual indemnification from parties supplying raw materials or parties marketing the products we sell. In any event, indemnification from the manufacturers of our products or from any other party is limited by the terms of the indemnity and by the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could result in judgments, fines, damages and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur significant expense investigating and defending these claims, even if they do not result in liability. Moreover, even if no judgments, fines, damages or liabilities are imposed on us, our reputation could suffer as result of a product liability claim, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProduct liability insurance for the healthcare industry may become prohibitively expensive, to the extent it is available at all. We may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or be able to secure increased coverage as commercialization of our products progresses, nor can we be sure that existing or future claims against us will be covered by our product liability insurance. In the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liability claims relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInterruptions in the supply of our products or inventory loss may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products are manufactured using technically complex processes requiring specialized facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict company and government standards for the manufacture and storage of our products, subjects us to production risks. In addition to ongoing production risks, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements including stability requirements or specifications. Most of our products must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range. For example, if environmental conditions deviate from that range, our products\u2019 remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their safety and efficacy could be adversely affected, making them unsuitable for use. These deviations may go undetected. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters may make compliance with these processes and maintenance of these standards more difficult, and climate change threatens more extreme weather events, which could increase our production risks. The occurrence of actual or suspected production and distribution problems can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases recalls, with consequential reputational damage and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production delays and result in substantial additional expenses. Any unforeseen failure in the storage of our products or loss in supply could result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our revenues and operations.\nIncreased prices for, or unavailability of, raw materials used in our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel related delivery costs, competition, import duties, excises and other indirect taxes, currency exchange rates, and government regulation. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment efforts of our customers and third-party payors, we may be unable to pass along cost increases for key components or raw materials through higher prices to our customers. If the cost of key components or raw materials increases, and we are unable fully to recover these increased costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials that cannot be recovered through productivity gains, price increases or other methods could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Planned Expansion into Wound and Skin Care Virtual Consult and Other Services\nOur planned expansion into wound and skin care virtual consult and other services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are currently developing the capability to offer various services addressing chronic wound and skin care through our wholly owned subsidiary UWSS. UWSS\u2019s services are expected to launch in 2021 and include an EMR software platform for both wound and skin conditions through WounDerm, which we acquired in January 2021, skin and wound virtual consult services through our affiliations with DirectDerm and MGroup, and diagnostic products and services for chronic wounds through our affiliation with Precision Healing. Our planned expansion into wound and skin care virtual consult and other services subjects us to risks associated with the use of new and novel technologies, operational, financial, regulatory, legal and reputational risks, as well as the risk that we may be unable to timely or successfully launch our service offerings. The success of UWSS\u2019s operations depends upon our ability to commercialize UWSS\u2019s service offerings, and our failure to do so could negatively affect our ability to generate revenue from these activities.\nOur planned expansion into wound and skin care virtual consult and other services will require entrance into several markets in which we have little or no experience, which may not be successful and could be costly.\nAs part of our planned expansion into wound and skin care virtual consult services, we will be required to enter into other markets in which we have little to no experience, including EMR, telehealth and healthcare diagnostics. While we intend to expand our staff with individuals with more experience in the EMR, telehealth and diagnostic markets and will closely scrutinize individuals we engage, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain or continue to hire well-qualified and experienced individuals or that our assessment of individuals we retain will be accurate. As we enter new markets, we will face new technological and operational risks and challenges with which we are unfamiliar and may incur significant costs. Entering new markets requires substantial management efforts and skills to mitigate these risks and challenges. Our lack of experience with certain of these new markets may result in unsuccessful new market entries. If we do not manage our entry into new markets properly, these costs and risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur planned expansion into the telehealth business is dependent on our relationships with affiliated professional entities to provide physician services, and our business would be adversely affected if those relationships were disrupted.\nThere is a risk that U.S. state authorities in some jurisdictions may find that any future contractual relationships we enter into with our affiliated professional entities who provide telehealth services violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and professional fee-splitting laws. These laws generally prohibit the practice of medicine by lay persons or entities or sharing of professional fees with lay persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing a physician\u2019s professional judgment. The corporate practice of medicine prohibition exists in some form, by statute, regulation, board of medicine or attorney general guidance, or case law, in most states and is subject to change and to evolving interpretations by state boards of medicine, state attorneys general and state courts. As such, we will be required to continually monitor our compliance with laws in every jurisdiction in which we plan to operate, and we cannot guarantee that subsequent interpretation of the corporate practice of medicine laws will not circumscribe our future business operations. State corporate practice of medicine doctrines could also subject physicians to penalties for aiding the corporate practice of medicine, which could discourage physicians from participating in our network of providers.\nDue to the prevalence of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in the states where we plan to conduct our telehealth business, we expect to continue contracting with provider-entities through management services agreements. Although we expect that these relationships will continue, we cannot guarantee that they will. A material change in our relationships with these provider entities, whether resulting from a dispute among the parties, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these affiliations, could impair our ability to provide services to our future clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any scrutiny, investigation or litigation with regard to our future arrangements with these professional entities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRecent and frequent state legislative and regulatory changes specific to telemedicine may present us with additional requirements and state compliance costs, with potential operational impacts in certain jurisdictions.\nThe state laws and regulations specific to telemedicine vary from state to state and are continually evolving. In some cases, these laws and regulations target \u201cdirect to consumer\u201d telehealth service offerings rather than specialty consultative services, such as our planned acute telemedicine service offerings, and incorporate informed consent, modality, medical records and follow up care and other requirements. Thus, where new legislation and regulations apply to our planned expansion into telemedicine services, we may incur costs to monitor, evaluate, and modify operational processes for compliance. All such activities will increase our costs and could, in certain circumstances, impact our ability to make telemedicine services available in a particular state.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nPart of our success depends on our and our research development partners\u2019 ability to protect proprietary rights to technologies used in certain of our products. We and our research development partners rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our or our research development partners\u2019 rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive advantage. Patents and patent applications for the products we have may not be broad enough to prevent competitors from introducing similar products into the market. Our or our research development partners\u2019 patents or attempts to enforce them may not be upheld by the courts. Efforts to enforce any of our or our research development partners\u2019 proprietary rights could be time-consuming and expensive, which could adversely affect our business and prospects and divert management\u2019s attention. There can be no assurance that our or our research and development partners\u2019 proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that such rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us.\nCellerateRX Surgical is not currently protected by any pending patent application nor any unexpired patent. Accordingly, CellerateRX Surgical may be subject to competition from the sale of substantially equivalent products that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nCellerateRX Surgical has no patent protection, and therefore, in order to continue to obtain commercial benefits from CellerateRX Surgical, we will rely on product manufacturing trade secrets, know-how and related non-patent intellectual property. The effect of CellerateRX Surgical\u2019s lack of patent protection depends, among other things, upon the nature of the market and the position of our products in the market from time to time, the size of the market, the complexities and economics of manufacturing a competitive product and applicable regulatory approval requirements. In the event that competition develops substantially equivalent products, this competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The entrance into the market of a product substantially equivalent to CellerateRX Surgical may erode our product\u2019s market share, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are heavily dependent on technologies and products we have licensed from third parties, and we may need to license technologies and products in the future, and if we fail to obtain licenses we need, or fail to comply with our payment obligations in the agreements under which we in-license intellectual property and other rights from third parties, we could lose our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nWe are heavily dependent on licenses from our research and development partners for all of our technologies and products and are party to a sublicense agreement with CGI Cellerate RX, license agreements with Rochal and a marketing and distribution agreement with Cook Biotech. Our sublicense agreement and license agreements require that we pay royalties to the sublicensor or licensor, as applicable, based on our net sales of the sublicensed and licensed products.\nNo assurance can be given that our existing sublicense agreement, license agreements or marketing and distribution agreement will be extended on reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we expect we will need to license intellectual property, technology and products from third parties in the future and that these licenses will be material to our business. No assurance can be given that we will meet our minimum performance obligations or generate sufficient revenue or raise additional financing to meet our payment obligations in our agreements with CGI Cellerate RX, Rochal and Cook Biotech or other license or marketing and distribution agreements we enter into with third parties in the future. Any failure to meet our minimum performance obligations or make the payments required by our agreements may permit the licensor or supplier to terminate the agreement. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain these licenses or marketing and distribution agreements for any reason, it would halt our ability to commercialize our pipeline products. Furthermore, such loss of these licenses or marketing and distribution agreements may enable development of new products that may compete with our pipeline products, and our competitors may gain proprietary position. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\nThird parties, including customers, may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions may emerge over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claim assertions, particularly in the U.S. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the healthcare field, the secrecy of some pending patent applications and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, we believe that it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe the patent rights of others. The asserted claims or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nOur business is affected by numerous regulations relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of our products.\nGovernment regulation by the FDA and similar agencies in other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacturing and marketing of our products and in the acquisition or licensing of new products. Complying with government regulations is often time consuming and expensive and may involve delays or actions adversely impacting the marketing and sale of our current or future products.\nFollowing initial regulatory approval or clearance of any products that we or our research and development partners may develop, we and/or our research and development partners will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nestablishment registration and device listing requirements;\n\u25cf\nQSR, which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices;\n\u25cf\nlabeling requirements, which mandate the inclusion of certain content in medical device labels and labeling, and when fully implemented, will generally require the label and package of medical devices to include a unique device identifier, and which also prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., \u201coff-label,\u201d indications;\n\u25cf\nthe Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and\n\u25cf\nthe Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals) if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health and that manufacturers and importers keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, the FDA or other governmental authorities:\n\u25cf\nimposing fines and penalties on us;\n\u25cf\npreventing us from manufacturing or selling our products;\n\u25cf\ndelaying or denying pending applications for approval or clearance of our products or of new uses or modifications to our existing products, or withdrawing or suspending current approvals or clearances;\n\u25cf\nordering or requesting a recall of our products;\n\u25cf\nissuing warning letters, untitled letters, or \u201cIt has Come to Our Attention\u201d letters;\n\u25cf\nimposing operating restrictions, including a partial or total shutdown of production or investigation of any or all of our products;\n\u25cf\nrefusing to permit to import or export of our products;\n\u25cf\ndetaining or seizing our products;\n\u25cf\nobtaining injunctions preventing us from manufacturing or distributing any or all of our products;\n\u25cf\ncommencing criminal prosecutions or seeking civil penalties; and\n\u25cf\nrequiring changes in our advertising and promotion practices.\nThe manufacturing facilities we or our research and development partners use (and may use) to make any of our FDA-regulated products are or may become subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. If a previously unknown problem with a product or a manufacturing or laboratory facility used or contracted by us or one of our research and development partners is discovered, the FDA may impose restrictions on that product or on the manufacturing facility, including requiring us and/or our research and development partner to withdraw the product from the market. Any changes to an approved or cleared product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often requires FDA review and separate approval or clearance before the product, as modified, may be marketed. In addition, for products we develop in the future, we and our contract manufacturers may be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for submission of safety and other post-market approval information. If we violate regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after marketing approval or clearance is obtained, we may be fined, be forced to remove a product from the market or experience other adverse consequences, which would materially harm our financial results. Additionally, due to limitations imposed on us by the scope of the cleared or approved indications or intended use of our products and by FDA and Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) regulations relating to promotional claims, we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for product promotion.\nDistribution of our products outside the United States is subject to extensive government regulation. These regulations, including the requirements for marketing authorizations or product licenses necessary to bring a medical product to market, the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations, vary from country to country. We do not know whether we will obtain the marketing authorizations or product licenses necessary to market our products in such countries or that we will not be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining these regulatory approvals.\nIf we fail to obtain or experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market future medical device products, we will be unable to commercialize these products until such clearance or approval is obtained.\nThe developing, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of medical devices is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory clearance and approval of certain medical technology products is costly and time consuming. Inherent in the development of new medical products is the potential for delay because product testing, including clinical evaluation, is typically required, especially for drugs, biologics and high-risk devices, before such products can be approved for human use. With respect to medical devices, such as those that we currently market, before a new medical device, or a new indicated use of, or claim for, an existing product can be marketed (unless it is a Class I device), it must first receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or approval of a PMA from the FDA, or be reclassified and receive marketing authorization through the de novo classification process, unless an exemption applies.\nIn the 510(k)-clearance process, the FDA must determine that the proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a Class I or II device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, with respect to intended use, technology, safety and effectiveness to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence for certain device types. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. If a device is novel and there is no appropriate predicate to which the applicant can demonstrate substantial equivalence, the device will be automatically classified as a Class III device and require approval through the PMA process prior to commercialization, unless the applicant submits a de novo classification request demonstrating that the novel device should be reclassified into Class I or II. Demonstrating that a novel device should be reclassified to Class I or II from Class III typically requires extensive information and data on the benefits and risks of the device, including performance data and frequently data from one or more clinical studies. The 510(k), PMA and de novo classification approval processes can be expensive and lengthy.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, suspension or withdrawal of clearances or approvals, seizure or recall of products, injunctions against the manufacture, holding, distribution, marketing and sale of a product and civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore, changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory clearances or approvals. Meeting regulatory requirements and evolving government standards may delay marketing of any new products developed by us for a considerable period of time, impose costly procedures upon our activities and result in a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete against us.\nWe cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will clear or approve any products developed by us on a timely basis, if at all, or, if granted, that clearance or approval will not entail limiting the indicated uses for which we may market the product, which could limit the potential market for any of these products.\nChanges to the FDA clearance and approval processes or ongoing regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to obtain FDA clearance or approval of new products or comply with ongoing requirements.\nNew government regulations may be enacted and changes in FDA policies and regulations and, their interpretation and enforcement, could prevent or delay regulatory clearance or approval of new products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. Therefore, we do not know whether we or our research and development partners will be able to continue to comply with such regulations or whether the costs of such compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes could, among other things, require different labeling, monitoring of patients, interaction with physicians, education programs for patients or physicians, curtailment of necessary supplies, or limitations on product distribution. These changes, or others required by the FDA could have an adverse effect on our business, and specifically, on the sales of affected products. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory science and regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time, we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements. If we or our research and development partners are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and our business would suffer.\nModifications to our current products may require new marketing clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until such clearances or approvals are obtained.\nAny modification to an FDA-cleared product that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its indicated use, requires a new FDA 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. In addition, any significant modification to an FDA-approved product, such as a new indication for use, labeling changes, or manufacturing changes, requires submission of a PMA supplement or 30-day notice for changes to manufacturing procedures or methods of manufacture that affect the safety and effectiveness of the product. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make its own determination as to whether a modification requires a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, but the FDA may review and disagree with any decision reached by the manufacturer. In the future, we or our research and development partners may make additional modifications to our products after they have received FDA clearance or approval and, in appropriate circumstances, determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our or our research and development partners\u2019 decisions not to seek new clearance or approval and may require us or the research and development partner that controls the marketing authorization for the respective device to obtain clearance or approval for previous modifications to our products. If that were to occur for a previously cleared or approved product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain, or our research and development partner obtains, the necessary clearance or approval. Under these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFailure to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement or insurance coverage for drugs, if any, could limit our ability to market those drugs and decrease our ability to generate revenue. Changes in reimbursement policies and regulations by governmental or other third-party payors may have an adverse impact on the use of our products.\nThe pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of our products, if any, must be sufficient to support our commercial efforts and other development programs, and the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers, are essential for most patients to be able to afford medical treatments. Sales of our products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products, if any, will be paid for or reimbursed by health maintenance, managed care, and similar healthcare management organizations, or government payers and private payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only in limited amounts, we may have to subsidize or provide medical products for free or we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products.\nA significant portion of our wound care products are purchased principally for the Medicare and Medicaid eligible population by hospital outpatient clinics, wound care clinics, durable medical equipment (\u201cDME\u201d) suppliers and SNFs, which typically bill various third-party payors, primarily state and federal healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), and managed care plans, for the products and services provided to their patients. Although the majority of our wound care products are currently eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B, adjustments to our reimbursement amounts or a change in CMS\u2019s reimbursement policies could have an adverse effect on our market opportunities in this area. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of our business because reimbursement status affects which products our customers purchase. In addition, our ability to obtain reimbursement approval in foreign jurisdictions may affect our ability to expand our product offerings internationally.\nThird-party payors have adopted, and are continuing to adopt, a number of policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These policies include the imposition of conditions of payment by foreign, state and federal healthcare programs as well as private insurance plans, and the reduction in reimbursement amounts applicable to specific products and services.\nChanges in healthcare systems in the U.S. or internationally in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our products or denies coverage for these procedures would also have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices which our customers are willing to pay for them.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and private payors in the United States and abroad to limit or reduce healthcare costs may result in restrictions on coverage and the level of reimbursement for new medical products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with our products due to the increasing trend toward managed healthcare, including the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and prescription drugs or biologics in particular, has and is expected to continue to increase in the future. As a result, profitability of our current or future products, may be more difficult to achieve.\nWe rely on our research and development partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to product classification and FDA marketing authorization.\nWe rely on our research and development partners, from whom we license all of the products we currently commercialize, to determine the appropriate classification for each such product and to comply with applicable regulations related to obtaining the proper marketing authorization. With respect to each medical device product we license, our respective research and development partner designs the product and determines whether the device should be classified as a Class I, II, or III device and the appropriate FDA marketing authorization pathway to pursue (i.e., 510(k), PMA or de novo classification). In addition, we rely on our research and development partners to determine whether specific legal or regulatory definitions or exemptions apply to particular medical products, which individually may be subject to FDA oversight as a device, drug, biologic or human cellular or tissue-based product. The FDA has broad regulatory authority to interpret and enforce the laws and regulations that govern medical products in commercial distribution, and any adverse determination by the FDA relating to one of our licensed products could require significant cost and effort to comply.\nFor example, our research and development partner, Cook Biotech, from whom we have the right to exclusively distribute three biologic products for surgical and wound care applications, has determined that one such product, VIM Amnion Matrix, is intended for homologous use as a wound covering or barrier. It is possible that the FDA, after evaluating the product, its intended use and any promotional claims, may not agree with Cook Biotech\u2019s conclusion that the VIM Amnion Matrix product is intended for homologous use, which would change the legal framework under which the product is regulated and may require Cook Biotech and us to incur substantial costs and expend significant effort to bring the product into compliance with applicable regulations. Such action by the FDA may also require us to cease marketing operations relating to the VIM Amnion Matrix product until the appropriate corrections are complete.\nWe and our employees and contractors are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including false claims laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws. These laws may affect our operations, including the financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. U.S. federal and state laws that affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for, the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf\nSection 242 of HIPAA codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or from making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program (i.e., public or private);\n\u25cf\nfederal transparency laws, including the so-called federal \u201csunshine\u201d law, which requires the tracking and disclosure to the federal government by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests that are held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u25cf\nstate law equivalents of each of these federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with their industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, state laws that require drug and medical device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that prohibit giving gifts to licensed healthcare professionals and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances, such as specific disease states.\nIn particular, activities and arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, waste and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of activities or other arrangements related to the development, marketing or promotion of products, including pricing and discounting of products, provision of customer incentives, provision of reimbursement support, other customer support services, provision of sales commissions or other incentives to employees and independent contractors and other interactions with healthcare practitioners, other healthcare providers and patients.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrow scope of the statutory or regulatory exceptions and safe harbors available, our business activities could be challenged under one or more of these laws. Relationships between medical product manufacturers and health care providers are an area of heightened scrutiny by the government. We engage in various activities, including the conduct of speaker programs to educate physicians, the provision of reimbursement advice and support to customers, and the provision of customer and patient support services, that have been the subject of government scrutiny and enforcement action within the medical device industry.\nGovernment expectations and industry best practices for compliance continue to evolve and past activities may not always be consistent with current industry best practices. Further, there is a lack of government guidance as to whether various industry practices comply with these laws, and government interpretations of these laws continue to evolve, all of which create compliance uncertainties. Any non-compliance could result in regulatory sanctions, criminal or civil liability and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure that our employees\u2019 and commercial partners\u2019 activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and patients are appropriate, ethical, and consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, policies and standards, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in preventing such conduct, mitigating risks, or reducing the chance of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations.\nIf a government entity opens an investigation into possible violations of any of these laws (which may include the issuance of subpoenas), we would have to expend significant resources to defend ourselves against the allegations. Allegations that we, our officers, or our employees violated any one of these laws can be made by individuals called \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d who may be our employees, customers, competitors or other parties. Government policy is to encourage individuals to become whistleblowers and file a complaint in federal court alleging wrongful conduct. The government is required to investigate all of these complaints and decide whether to intervene. If the government intervenes and we are required to pay damages, which in such cases are typically set at three times the actual monetary damages, to the government, the whistleblower, as a reward, is awarded a percentage of such damages or any settlement amount. If the government declines to intervene, the whistleblower may proceed on her own and, if she is successful, she will receive a percentage of any judgment or settlement amount the company is required to pay. The government may also initiate an investigation on its own. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, and other sanctions that may materially impair our ability to run a profitable business. In particular, if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or if we agree to settle with the government without admitting to any wrongful conduct or if we are found to be in violation of any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, our officers and employees may be subject to sanctions, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and the imposition of a corporate integrity agreement, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur research and development partners\u2019 use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including health information, is subject to federal and state privacy and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNumerous state and federal laws and regulations, including HIPAA, govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of PII, including protected health information. HIPAA establishes a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of PHI by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, which likely includes us. HIPAA requires healthcare providers and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims. HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts will be able to award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.\nIn addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities or business associates for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. HIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees or authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually.\nNumerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of PII, including PHI. These laws in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, the HIPAA rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. In addition, new health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle healthcare related data, and the cost of complying with standards could be significant. If we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to PHI, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.\nBecause of the extreme sensitivity of the PII we or our partners may store and transmit, the security features of our technology platforms are very important. If our security measures, some of which may be managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to sensitive client and patient data, including HIPAA-regulated PHI. As a result, our reputation could be severely damaged, adversely affecting client or investor confidence. Clients may curtail their use of or stop using our products and services, which would cause our business to suffer. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, penalties and regulatory actions for violation of HIPAA and other applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation, notification to individuals and for measures to prevent future occurrences. Any potential security breach could also result in increased costs associated with liability for stolen assets or information, repairing system damage that may have been caused by such breaches, incentives offered to client or other business partners in an effort to maintain our business relationships after a breach and implementing measures to prevent future occurrences, including organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third-party experts and consultants. While we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, our coverage may not be sufficient to compensate for all liability.\nGovernment regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us to incur additional costs, and could restrict our operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific products and services may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the services that we aim to provide. However, these laws and regulations may nonetheless be applied to our business. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and materially affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with extensive healthcare laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nlicensure of health providers, certification of organizations and enrollment with government reimbursement programs;\n\u25cf\nnecessity and adequacy of medical care;\n\u25cf\nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;\n\u25cf\nbilling and coding for services;\n\u25cf\nproperly handling overpayments;\n\u25cf\nquality of medical equipment and services;\n\u25cf\nqualifications of medical and support personnel;\n\u25cf\nconfidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical records; and\n\u25cf\ncommunications with patients and consumers.\nAmong these laws are the federal Stark Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the FCA, and similar state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil sanctions and criminal penalties, including the loss of our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. While we endeavor to ensure that our financial relationships with referral sources such as hospitals and physicians comply with the applicable laws (including applicable safe harbors and exceptions), evolving interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our operations. A determination that we have violated these or other laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these or other laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business.\nOur officers, employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or activities that are improper under other laws and regulations, which would create liability for us.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our officers, employees, independent contractors (including contract research organizations CROs), principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity and/or may fail to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Misconduct by these parties could include, but is not limited to, intentional, reckless and/or negligent failures to comply with:\n\u25cf\nthe laws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts requiring, among other things, compliance with good manufacturing practice and/or quality system requirements, post-market vigilance reporting, product marketing authorization requirements, facility registration requirements, the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies, including but not limited to safety problems associated with the use of our products;\n\u25cf\nlaws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts concerning the conduct of clinical trials and the protection of human research subjects, including but not limited to good clinical practices;\n\u25cf\nother laws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts relating to the manufacture, processing, packing, holding, investigating or distributing in commerce of medical devices, biological products and/or HCT/Ps;\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing standards we have established; or\n\u25cf\nhealthcare fraud and abuse laws, including but not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the FCA, and state law equivalents.\nIn particular, companies involved in the manufacture of medical products are subject to laws and regulations intended to ensure that medical products that will be used in patients are safe and effective, and, specifically, that they are not adulterated or misbranded, that they are properly labeled, and have the identity, strength, quality and purity that which they are represented to possess. Further, companies involved in the research and development of medical products are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to protect research subjects and ensure the integrity of data generated from clinical trials and of the regulatory review process. Any misconduct in any of these areas, whether by our own employees or by contractors, vendors, business associates, consultants, or other entities acting as our agents, could result in regulatory sanctions, criminal or civil liability and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure that our employees\u2019, CRO partners\u2019, principal investigators\u2019, consultants\u2019, and commercial partners\u2019 activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and patients are appropriate, ethical, and consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, policies and standards, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in preventing such conduct, mitigating risks, or reducing the chance of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, or our CRO partners, principal investigators, consultants, or commercial partners, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, and other sanctions that may materially impair our ability to run a profitable business.\nWe could be adversely affected if healthcare reform measures substantially change the market for medical care or healthcare coverage in the United States.\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) and on March 30, 2010, the signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (P.L. 111-152), collectively commonly referred to as the \u201cHealthcare Reform Law.\u201d The Healthcare Reform Law included a number of new rules regarding health insurance, the provision of healthcare, conditions to reimbursement for healthcare services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients, and other healthcare policy reforms. Through the law-making process, substantial changes have been and continue to be made to the system for paying for healthcare in the United States, including changes made to extend medical benefits to certain Americans who lacked insurance coverage and to contain or reduce healthcare costs (such as by reducing or conditioning reimbursement amounts for healthcare services and drugs, and imposing additional taxes, fees, and rebate obligations on pharmaceutical and medical device companies). This legislation was one of the most comprehensive and significant reforms ever experienced by the healthcare industry in the United States and has significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. This legislation has impacted the scope of healthcare insurance and incentives for consumers and insurance companies, among others. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Law\u2019s provisions were designed to encourage providers to find cost savings in their clinical operations. This environment has caused changes in the purchasing habits of consumers and providers and resulted in specific attention to the pricing negotiation, product selection and utilization review surrounding pharmaceuticals and medical devices. This attention may result in our current commercial products, products we may commercialize or promote in the future, and our therapeutic candidates, being chosen less frequently or the pricing being substantially lowered. At this stage, it is difficult to estimate the full extent of the direct or indirect impact of the Healthcare Reform Law on us.\nThese structural changes could entail further modifications to the existing system of private payors and government programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), creation of government-sponsored healthcare insurance sources, or some combination of both, as well as other changes. Restructuring the coverage of medical care in the U.S. could impact the reimbursement for medical services and procedures, prescribed drugs, biologics and medical devices, including our current commercial products, those we and our development or commercialization partners are currently developing or those that we may commercialize or promote in the future. If reimbursement for the products we currently commercialize or promote, any product we may commercialize or promote, or approved therapeutic candidates is substantially reduced or otherwise adversely affected in the future, or rebate obligations associated with any pharmaceutical product we commercialize or promote are substantially increased, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nExtending medical benefits to those who currently lack coverage will likely result in substantial costs to the U.S. federal government, which may force significant additional changes to the healthcare system in the United States. Much of the funding for expanded healthcare coverage may be sought through cost savings. While some of these savings may come from realizing greater efficiencies in delivering care, improving the effectiveness of preventive care and enhancing the overall quality of care, much of the cost savings may come from reducing the cost of care and increased enforcement activities. Cost of care could be reduced further by decreasing the level of reimbursement for medical services or products (including our current commercial products, our development or commercialization partners or any product or medical service we may commercialize or promote), or by restricting coverage (and, thereby, utilization) of medical services or products. In either case, a reduction in the utilization of, or reimbursement for our current commercial products, any product we may commercialize or promote or for which we receive marketing approval or clearance in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nSeveral states and private entities initially mounted legal challenges to the Healthcare Reform Law, and they continue to litigate various aspects of the legislation. On July 26, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court generally upheld the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Law at issue as constitutional. However, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the legislation improperly required the states to expand their Medicaid programs to cover more individuals. As a result, the states have a choice as to whether they will expand the number of individuals covered by their respective state Medicaid programs. Some states have not expanded their Medicaid programs and have chosen to develop other cost-saving and coverage measures to provide care to currently uninsured individuals. Many of these efforts to date have included the institution of Medicaid-managed care programs. The manner in which these cost-saving and coverage measures are implemented could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther, the healthcare regulatory environment has seen significant changes in recent years and is still in flux. Legislative initiatives to modify, limit, replace, or repeal the Healthcare Reform Law and judicial challenges continue. We cannot predict the impact on our business of future legislative and legal challenges to the Healthcare Reform Law or other changes to the current laws and regulations. The uncertainty around the future of the Healthcare Reform Law, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe financial impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation over the next few years will depend on a number of factors, including the policies reflected in implementing regulations and guidance and changes in sales volumes for therapeutics affected by the legislation. From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing coverage, reimbursement, and marketing of medical products and services. In addition, third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies are often revised or interpreted in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.\nWhile in office, President Trump supported the repeal of all or portions of the Healthcare Reform Law. President Trump also issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration\u2019s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the Healthcare Reform Law and in which he directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Law to the maximum extent permitted by law. Congress has enacted legislation that repeals certain portions of the Healthcare Reform Law, including but not limited to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in December 2017, which included a provision that eliminates the penalty under the Healthcare Reform Law\u2019s individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, as well as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, which, among other things, repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board (which was established by the Healthcare Reform Law and was intended to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending).\nAdditionally, in December 2018, a district court in Texas held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the Healthcare Reform Law is, therefore, invalid. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the holding on the individual mandate but remanded the case back to the lower court to reassess whether and how such holding affects the validity of the rest of the Healthcare Reform Law. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and allocated one hour for oral arguments, which occurred on November 10, 2020. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected to be issued in spring 2021. It is unclear how this litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the Healthcare Reform Law will impact the policies and programs implemented under the Healthcare Reform Law and the medical products industry more generally. We also cannot predict the impact that this litigation against the Healthcare Reform Law will have on our business, and there is uncertainty as to what healthcare programs and regulations may be implemented or changed at the federal and/or state level in the United States or the effect of any future legislation or regulation. Furthermore, we cannot predict what actions the Biden administration will implement in connection with the Healthcare Reform Law. However, it is possible that such initiatives could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain approval and/or successfully commercialize products in the United States in the future. For example, any changes that reduce, or impede the ability to obtain, reimbursement for the type of products or services we currently or intend to commercialize in the United States or that reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our operations and/or future business plans.\nDefects, failures or quality issues associated with our products could lead to product recalls or safety alerts, adverse regulatory actions, litigation and negative publicity that could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products, and our future operating results will depend on our ability to maintain an effective quality control system and effectively train and manage our workforce with respect to our quality system. The development, manufacture and control of medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and similar foreign agencies. Compliance with these regulatory requirements, including but not limited to the FDA\u2019s QSR, good manufacturing practices and adverse events/recall reporting requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may also require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of products cleared or approved for use in their jurisdictions. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers and independent sales agencies are also subject to periodic regulatory inspections. If the FDA or other regulatory authority were to conclude that we or our suppliers have failed to comply with any of these requirements, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, withdrawals, monetary penalties, consent decrees, injunctive actions to halt the manufacture or distribution of products, import detentions of products made outside the United States, export restrictions, restrictions on operations or other civil or criminal sanctions. Civil or criminal sanctions could be assessed against our officers, employees, or us. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the results of future legislative activity or future court decisions, any of which could increase regulatory requirements, subject us to government investigations or expose us to unexpected litigation. Any regulatory action or litigation, regardless of the merits, may result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and place additional restrictions on our sales or the use of our products. In addition, negative publicity, including regarding a quality or safety issue, could damage our reputation, reduce market acceptance of our products, cause us to lose customers and decrease demand for our products. Any actual or perceived quality issues may also result in issuances of physician\u2019s advisories against our products or cause us to conduct voluntary recalls. Any product defects or problems, regulatory action, litigation, negative publicity or recalls could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe issuance of shares upon the exercise of derivative securities may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.\nAs of March 30, 2021, we had 11,500 shares of common stock that were issuable upon the exercise of vested outstanding stock options. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of these options may result in dilution to the equity interest and voting power of holders of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may also issue additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock. For instance, certain of the product license agreements we have entered into with third parties require us to make payments to such third parties upon the occurrence of certain events. Pursuant to these product license agreements, we may choose to make such payments in shares of our common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock may substantially dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders. Furthermore, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nIt is possible that we will require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and expect to require additional funds to respond to business challenges. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when and if we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock is highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\ntechnological innovations or new products and services by us or by our competitors, including announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u25cf\nthe continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\nloss of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cf\nindustry developments;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions, including market volatility;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u25cf\neconomic, political and other external factors;\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf\napplicable regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries, both generally or specific to us and our products; and\n\u25cf\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us.\nAlthough publicly traded securities are subject to price and volume fluctuations, it is likely that our common stock will experience these fluctuations to a greater degree than the securities of more established and better capitalized organizations.\nOur common stock does not have a vigorous trading market, and you may not be able to sell your securities at or near ask prices, or at all.\nAlthough there is a public market for our common stock, trading volume has been historically low, which could impact our stock price and your ability to sell shares of our common stock at or near ask prices, or at all. We can give no assurance that a more active and liquid public market for the shares of our common stock will develop in the future.\nThe potential sale of large amounts of common stock may have a negative effect upon the market value of our shares.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. As additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market, the supply of our common stock will increase, which could decrease the price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid, and we are unlikely to pay, cash dividends on our securities in the near future. Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe have not paid and do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, which may limit the current return available on an investment in our stock. Future dividends on our stock, if any, will depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and such other factors as our management may consider relevant. Currently, we intend to retain earnings, if any, to increase our net worth and reserves. Consequently, shareholders will only realize an economic gain on their investment in our common stock if the price appreciates. Shareholders should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Because we currently do not pay dividends, and there may be limited trading in our common stock, shareholders may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on their common stock. Therefore, our failure to pay dividends may cause shareholders to not see any return on their common stock even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends, we may have trouble raising additional funds, which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nA few of our existing shareholders own a large percentage of our voting stock and have control over matters requiring shareholder approval and may delay or prevent a change in control or otherwise lead to actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nAs of March 30, 2021, our directors owned, and through their affiliates controlled, more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our directors and their affiliates could have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including (i) the election and removal of directors, (ii) any proposed merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets as well as other corporate transactions and (iii) any amendment to our Certificate of Formation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Formation\u201d). This concentration of control could be disadvantageous to other shareholders having different interests. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors sometimes perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling shareholders.\nIn addition, our Certificate of Formation contains a provision which under the Texas Business Organizations Code (the \u201cTBOC\u201d) could allow the shareholders who own a majority of our common stock to approve certain major transactions without the approval of other shareholders that otherwise would be required under Texas corporation law.\nOur Certificate of Formation includes provisions limiting the personal liability of our directors for breaches of fiduciary duties under Texas law.\nOur Certificate of Formation contains a provision eliminating a director\u2019s personal liability to the fullest extent permitted under Texas law. Pursuant to the TBOC, a corporation has the power to indemnify its directors and officers against judgments and certain expenses other than judgments that are actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a proceeding, provided that there is a determination that the individual acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the individual\u2019s conduct was unlawful. However, no indemnification may be made in respect of any proceeding in which such individual is liable to the corporation or improperly received a personal benefit and is found liable for willful misconduct, breach of the duty of loyalty owned to the corporation, or an act or omission deemed not to be committed in good faith.\nThe principal effect of the limitation on liability provision is that a shareholder will be unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against a director unless the shareholder can demonstrate a basis for liability for which indemnification is not available under the TBOC. This provision, however, should not limit or eliminate our rights or any shareholder\u2019s rights to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director\u2019s fiduciary duty. This provision will not alter a director\u2019s liability under federal securities laws. The inclusion of this provision in our Certificate of Formation may discourage or deter shareholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our shareholders.\nTexas law and our Certificate of Formation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that shareholders may consider favorable.\nUnder our Certificate of Formation, our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred stock, which could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock and make a change of control of the Company more difficult even if it might benefit our shareholders. The board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the voting powers, preferences and other rights and limitations of the preferred stock. Accordingly, we may issue shares of preferred stock with a preference over our common stock with respect to dividends or distributions on liquidation or dissolution, or that may otherwise adversely affect the voting or other rights of the holders of common stock. Issuances of preferred stock, depending upon the rights, preferences and designations of the preferred stock, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control, even if that change of control might benefit our shareholders.\nIn addition, provisions of our Certificate of Formation and bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. For example, our Certificate of Formation and bylaws (i) do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose), (ii) require that special meetings of the shareholders be called by the Chairman of the board of directors, the President or the board of directors, or by the holders of not less than ten percent (10%) of all the shares issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, (iii) permit our board of directors to alter, amend or repeal our bylaws or to adopt new bylaws, and (iv) enable our board of directors to increase the number of persons serving as directors and to fill vacancies created as a result of the increase by a majority vote of the directors present at a meeting of directors.\nWhile we are subject to the provisions of Title 2, Chapter 21, Subchapter M of the TBOC, which provides that a Texas corporation that qualifies as an \u201cissuing public corporation\u201d (as defined in the TBOC) may not engage in specified types of business combinations, including mergers, consolidations and asset sales, with a person, or an affiliate or associate of that person, who is an \u201caffiliated shareholder,\u201d the restrictions in Title 2, Chapter 21, Subchapter M of the TBOC do not apply to us because we have elected, in the manner provided under the TBOC, not to be subject to such provisions.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cSMTI.\u201d If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), such as the corporate governance requirements, the shareholder\u2019s equity requirement or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting or even notification of failure to comply with such requirements would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we expect that we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.", "PERMNO": 76928, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "SMTI"}
