{"cik": "1032208", "company": "SEMPRA ENERGY", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWhen evaluating our company and its subsidiaries, you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report. These risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of the following occurs, our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in, or attached as an exhibit to, this annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the information set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. MD&A.\u201d In this section, when we state that a risk or uncertainty may, could or will have a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d on us, or may, could or will \u201cmaterially adversely affect\u201d us, we mean that the risk or uncertainty may, could or will, as the case may be, have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and/or the trading prices of our securities or those of our subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to Sempra Energy\nSempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities that are accounted for as equity method investments, such as Oncor Holdings, and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries and equity method investments.\nWe are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries and in entities accounted for as equity method investments, such as Oncor Holdings. Our ability to pay dividends and to meet our debt and other obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from our subsidiaries and JVs and other entities in which we have invested and, in the short term, our ability to raise capital from external sources. In the long term, cash flows from our subsidiaries and other entities in which we have invested depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own expenditures, common and preferred stock dividends, and debt or other obligations. In addition, the subsidiaries and other entities accounted for as equity method investments are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us, whether to enable us to pay principal and interest on our debt securities, our other obligations or dividends on our common stock or our preferred stock, and could be precluded from paying any such dividends or making any such loans or distributions under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, as a result of legislation, regulation, court order, contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress. The inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments as well from the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition.\nCertain credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook.\nCredit rating agencies routinely evaluate Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas, and their long-term and short-term debt ratings are based on a number of factors, including the perceived supportiveness of the regulatory environment affecting utility operations, ability to generate cash flows, level of indebtedness, overall financial strength and the status of certain capital projects, as well as factors beyond our control, such as tax reform, the state of the economy and our industry generally.\nMoody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch Ratings have increasingly focused on the increased risk of wildfires in California, the current California regulatory environment and the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which under California law imposes strict liability on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire (meaning that the utility may be found liable regardless of fault). In 2018, and primarily as a result of their position on the increased risk of wildfires in California and the current California regulatory environment, each of Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch Ratings downgraded SDG&E\u2019s issuer rating, senior secured and senior unsecured credit ratings. On January 21, 2019, S&P downgraded SDG&E\u2019s issuer credit rating to BBB+ from A- while maintaining its negative outlook. On January 22, 2019, Fitch Ratings affirmed SDG&E\u2019s long-term issuer default rating at A- but revised the rating outlook to negative from stable. On January 24, 2019, Moody\u2019s placed SDG&E under review for downgrade. The ratings actions in January 2019 were primarily the result of recent wildfires in California in counties outside of the California Utilities\u2019 electric service territory and the possible inability to recover costs and expenses in cases where California IOUs, like the California Utilities, are determined to have had their equipment be the cause of a fire. While SDG&E\u2019s credit ratings are investment grade, each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no assurance that SDG&E\u2019s current credit ratings and ratings outlooks will remain the same or that SDG&E\u2019s credit ratings will not be further downgraded.\nAlso, in 2018, each of Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch Ratings affirmed credit ratings of Sempra Energy, and SoCalGas, with Moody\u2019s and S&P changing Sempra Energy\u2019s outlook to negative, and S&P changing SoCalGas\u2019 outlook to negative.\nFor Sempra Energy, the credit rating agencies noted that the following, among other things, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aa\nfurther weakening of SDG&E\u2019s business risk profile reflecting persistent California wildfires or if there is little meaningful progress in addressing inverse condemnation via changes in legislation and/or regulation in California that significantly reduces the exposure of electric utilities to strict liability in connection with wildfires;\n\u25aa\nif Sempra Energy fails to show a gradual improvement in certain of its financial metrics or does not address upcoming holding company debt maturities;\n\u25aa\nif Cameron LNG JV experiences cost overruns or delays requiring a substantially higher amount of equity injection from Sempra Energy than the credit rating agencies have estimated, or if the project is highly likely to be delayed beyond the long-stop completion date in September 2021 with low likelihood of extension or is terminated, making the exercise of the completion guarantee highly probable; and/or\n\u25aa\na downgrade at the California Utilities.\nFor SoCalGas, the credit rating agencies noted that the following, among others, could lead to a negative ratings action:\n\u25aa\na deterioration in the utility\u2019s relationship with the CPUC and/or the credit supportiveness of the California regulatory environment;\n\u25aa\na weakening to SDG&E\u2019s business risk profile reflecting continued and persistent California wildfires without a longer term reform to inverse condemnation; and/or\n\u25aa\nthe 2019 GRC results in inadequate relief or higher leverage that weakens SoCalGas\u2019 credit metrics on a sustained basis.\nWhile Sempra Energy\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 credit ratings are investment grade, each of the credit rating agencies reviews their ratings periodically, and there is no assurance that Sempra Energy\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 current credit ratings and ratings outlooks will remain the same or that Sempra Energy\u2019s and/or SoCalGas\u2019 credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nA downgrade of Sempra Energy\u2019s or any of its subsidiaries\u2019 credit ratings or rating outlooks may result in a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities, the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued, and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities. This could make it significantly more costly for Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra Energy\u2019s other subsidiaries to issue debt securities, to borrow under credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings. Such amounts could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nConditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us.\nOur businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations.\nLimitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects, as well as our ability to meet contractual and\nother commitments. In difficult credit market environments, we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new or ongoing business activities. This could cause us to reduce non-safety related capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt, both of which could significantly reduce our short-term and long-term profitability.\nIn addition, our variable rate indebtedness and credit facilities may incorporate LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing certain rates. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness and/or borrowings, and could impact the applicability of our cash flow hedges.\nOther factors can affect the availability and cost of credit for our businesses as well as the terms of equity and debt financing, including:\n\u25aa\nchanges or lack of changes to the regulatory environment in the State of California that may negatively affect energy companies generally, or the California Utilities in particular;\n\u25aa\nthe failure of the State of California to adequately address the financial and operational risks posed by the increased incidents of wildfires and by inverse condemnation;\n\u25aa\nthe overall health of the energy industry;\n\u25aa\nvolatility in electricity or natural gas prices;\n\u25aa\nan increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank;\n\u25aa\ncredit ratings downgrades; and\n\u25aa\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions.\nIn addition, over the past two years, California IOUs have suffered from the potential catastrophic losses resulting from the impact of the multiple wildfires that spread through Northern and Southern California (the \u201cCalifornia Wildfires\u201d). While the California Wildfires occurred in counties outside of the California Utilities\u2019 electric service territory, the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters and the possibility of catastrophic wildfires in the future have negatively impacted confidence in California IOUs generally, which could materially and adversely impact Sempra Energy\u2019s and the California Utilities\u2019 ability to access the capital markets at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable.\nSempra Energy has substantial investments in Mexico and South America which expose us to foreign currency, inflation, legal, tax, economic, geo-political and management oversight risk.\nWe have significant foreign operations in Mexico and South America. Our foreign operations pose complex management, foreign currency, inflation, legal, tax and economic risks. Certain of these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses. All our international businesses are sensitive to geo-political uncertainties and our non-utility international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, all of which may be driven by changes in their environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions, and various regional and local economic and political factors, risks and uncertainties, as well as U.S. foreign policy. Foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on our revenue, costs or cash flows from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our currency exposures are to the Mexican, Peruvian and Chilean currencies. Our Mexican subsidiaries have U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities that give rise to Mexican currency exchange rate movements for Mexican income tax purposes. They also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are significant, denominated in the Mexican peso that must be translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. Our primary objective when we attempt to reduce foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. We may attempt to hedge material cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments. We generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in OCI caused by exchange rate fluctuations, primarily related to our South American subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. We discuss our foreign currency exposure at our Mexican subsidiaries in \u201cItem 7. MD&A\u201d and \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nThe current U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements, such as NAFTA, and U.S. immigration policy by reviewing various options, including tariffs, for funding new Mexico-U.S. border security infrastructure. For example, in November 2018, President Trump signed the USMCA, which, if approved by the legislatures of the U.S., Mexico and Canada, would replace NAFTA. Such actions could result in changes in the Mexican, U.S. and other markets that could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. In addition, if NAFTA is replaced or the U.S. withdraws from the agreement, the Mexican government could implement retaliatory actions, such as the imposition of restrictions or import fees on Mexican imports of natural gas from the U.S. or imports and exports of electricity to and from the U.S. Any of these actions by either or both governments could adversely affect imports and exports between Mexico and the U.S. and negatively impact the U.S. and Mexican economies and the companies with whom we conduct business in Mexico, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or prospects.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our plan to divest certain of our assets as part of our capital rotation plan, our North American business strategy or our cost reduction efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nIn June 2018, we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to divest all our U.S. solar and wind assets and certain non-utility natural gas storage assets in the southeast U.S. (collectively, the Non-Utility U.S. Assets). Additionally, in January 2019, we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to sell our South American businesses. While we have completed the sale of a substantial portion of the Non-Utility U.S. Assets and expect to complete the sale of the remaining Non-Utility U.S. Assets in the second quarter of 2019, the pending sale will depend on the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions. While we expect to complete the sale of our South American businesses by the end of 2019, the planned sale will depend on several factors that may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, market conditions, industry trends, consent rights or other rights granted to or held by third parties and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms. Further, there can be no assurance that the completed sales, or the pending and planned sales, if completed, will result in additional value to our shareholders, or that we will be able to redeploy any capital that we obtain from such sales in a way that would result in additional value to our shareholders.\nIf we do not successfully manage our current capital rotation plan, our North American business strategy or our cost reduction efforts, or any other such activities that we may initiate in the future, any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nWhile we strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all our shareholders, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all our shareholders, activist shareholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Responding to proposals by activist shareholders, including in connection with a proxy contest instituted by shareholders, would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses (in the case of a proxy contest) and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. For example, on June 11, 2018, Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P. (collectively, Elliott) and Bluescape Resources Company LLC (Bluescape), collectively holders of an approximately 4.9-percent economic interest in our outstanding common stock as of such date, delivered a letter and accompanying presentation to our board of directors seeking collaboration with them and management to nominate six new directors identified by Elliott and Bluescape and establish a committee of the board of directors to conduct portfolio and operational reviews of our business. On September 18, 2018, we announced that we entered into a cooperation agreement with Elliott, Bluescape and Cove Key Management, LP. Under the cooperation agreement, each party has agreed to certain customary standstill restrictions until December 31, 2019, which is subject to extension until September 30, 2020 under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that the cooperation agreement will be extended and any failure to secure an extension or a termination of the agreement without a resolution could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, preferred stock and other securities. In addition, upon termination of the cooperation agreement, Elliott, Bluescape and/or Cove Key Management, LP may, among other things, attempt to effect additional significant changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management, which may disrupt our operations by requiring significant time and attention by management and our board of directors. We discuss the cooperation agreement in \u201cMD&A - Factors Influencing Future Performance.\u201d\nAny perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from proposals by activist shareholders or a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability that may be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist shareholders, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business and operating results. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of proposals by activist shareholders or proxy contests or matters relating thereto, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and could require us to incur significant additional costs.\nActions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock and our preferred stock, based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nThe TCJA may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, the value of investments in our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nThe TCJA significantly changed the IRC, including taxation of U.S. corporations by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, altering the expensing of capital expenditures, limiting interest deductions, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a one-time deemed repatriation tax on cumulative undistributed earnings of U.S.-owned foreign entities at the time of enactment and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions. Certain aspects of the legislation are subject to interpretation and will require implementing regulations by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as state tax authorities. The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts. In addition, the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation will be subject to the discretion of the FERC and state public utility commissions.\nAlthough it is unclear when or how capital markets, the FERC or state public utility commissions may respond to the TCJA, we do expect that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies, such as our funds from operations-to-debt percentage, will be negatively impacted as a result of an anticipated decrease in required income tax reimbursement payments to us from our domestic utility subsidiaries due to the decrease in the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate. Certain provisions of the TCJA, such as 100-percent expensing of capital expenditures and impacts on utilization of our NOLs, may influence how we fund capital expenditures, the timing of capital expenditures and possible redeployment of capital through sales or monetization of assets, the timing of repatriation of foreign earnings and the use of equity financing to reduce our future use of debt, although there can be no assurance that these strategies will reduce any potential adverse impact from these provisions of the TCJA. In addition, although we are not currently expecting the deductibility of our interest costs to affect future earnings based on our method of allocation across our businesses, the interest deduction limitation under the TCJA is subject to potential additional guidance or interpretation from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and there can be no assurance that any such additional guidance will not impact our current assessment.\nIt is also uncertain whether additional avenues will evolve for companies to manage the adverse aspects of this legislation. We believe that these strategies, to the extent available and if successfully applied, could lessen any such negative impacts on us, although there can be no assurance in this regard. In addition, adoption of the TCJA by state tax authorities, additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and on the value of investments in our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nWe discuss the effects of the TCJA further in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to All Sempra Energy Businesses\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, accidents, equipment failures, explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nLike other major industrial facilities, ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, mudslides, accidents, equipment failures, explosions or acts of terrorism. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials, as well as radioactive materials, and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as the risks to the surrounding communities, are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business. The facilities and infrastructure that we own or in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aa\nnatural gas, propane and ethane pipelines, storage and compressor facilities;\n\u25aa\nelectric transmission and distribution;\n\u25aa\npower generation plants, including renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation;\n\u25aa\nmarine and inland ethane and liquid fuels, LNG and LPG terminals and storage; and\n\u25aa\nnuclear power facilities, nuclear fuel and nuclear waste storage facilities (through our 20-percent minority interest in SONGS, which is currently being decommissioned).\nSuch incidents could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to us. Such incidents that do not directly affect\nour facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide natural gas and electricity to our customers. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nDepending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; natural gas, natural gas odorant, propane or ethane leaks; releases of other GHG; radioactive releases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as in cases where the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies. We discuss how the application of this doctrine in California imposes strict liability on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire (meaning the utility may be found liable regardless of fault) in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Factors Influencing Future Performance,\u201d in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and below under \u201cRisks Related to the California Utilities - Insurance coverage for future wildfires may be unobtainable, prohibitively expensive, or insufficient to cover losses we may incur, and we may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms.\u201d Insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become prohibitively expensive, may be disputed by the insurers, or may become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels, and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements, and other factors, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects, as well as the trading prices of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nOur businesses are subject to complex government regulations and tax requirements and may be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulations or requirements or in their interpretation or implementation.\nIn recent years, the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes on the federal, state and local levels. These changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses. These changes are ongoing, and we cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses. Moreover, existing regulations, laws and tariffs may be revised or reinterpreted, and new regulations, laws and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities. Special tariffs may also be imposed on components used in our businesses that could increase costs.\nOur businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements, and the regulations, laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs. Any new tax legislation, regulations or other interpretations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense and/or tax balances, and changes in tax policies could materially adversely impact our business. Changes in regulations, laws and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the California Utilities and other Sempra Energy businesses. These rules are commonly referred to as \u201caffiliate rules,\u201d which primarily impact commodity and commodity-related transactions. These businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations, or by additional CPUC or FERC rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas to, or to trade with, the California Utilities and with each other. Affiliate rules also restrict these businesses from entering into any such transactions with the California Utilities. Any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the LNG terminals, natural gas pipelines, electric generation facilities, or other operations of our subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses require numerous permits, licenses, franchise agreements and other governmental approvals from various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies; any failure to obtain or maintain required permits, licenses or approvals could cause our sales to materially decline and/or our costs to materially increase, and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nAll our existing and planned development projects require multiple approvals. The acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels, LNG and LPG terminals and storage; natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities; and electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure require numerous permits, licenses, franchise agreements, certificates and other approvals from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. Once received, approvals may be subject to litigation, and projects may be delayed, or approvals reversed or modified in litigation or otherwise. In addition, permits, licenses, franchise agreements, certificates and other approvals may be modified, rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses. SoCalGas\u2019 franchise agreements with Los Angeles County and the City of Los Angeles, where the Aliso Canyon\nnatural gas storage facility is located, are due to expire in 2023 and 2019, respectively. SDG&E\u2019s franchise agreement with the City of San Diego is due to expire in 2021. If there is a delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be precluded from constructing or operating facilities, or we may be forced to incur additional costs. Further, accidents beyond our control may cause us to violate the terms of conditional use permits, causing delays in projects. Any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits, licenses, certificates and other approvals could cause our sales to materially decline, and/or our costs to materially increase, and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses have significant environmental compliance costs, and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign statutes, rules and regulations and mandates relating to environmental protection, including, air quality, water quality and usage, wastewater discharge, solid waste management, hazardous waste disposal and remediation, conservation of natural resources, wetlands and wildlife, renewable energy resources, climate change and GHG emissions. We are required to obtain numerous governmental permits, licenses, certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses. Additionally, to comply with these legal requirements, we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, mitigation costs and emissions fees. The California Utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs for projects are not recoverable in rates. In addition, we may be ultimately responsible for all on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels, LNG and LPG terminals and storage; natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities; electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure; and other energy projects and properties; regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown, which exposes us to risks arising from contamination at our former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations. In the case of our California and other regulated utilities, some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Our facilities, including those in our JVs, are subject to laws and regulations that have been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to power generation facilities. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines and/or significant curtailments of our operations, which could materially adversely affect our cash flows and/or results of operations.\nIncreasing international, national, regional and state-level environmental concerns as well as related new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations, operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects. In particular, state-level laws and regulations, as well as potential state, national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of GHG emissions, may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations. The implementation of recent and proposed California legislation and regulation may materially adversely affect our non-utility businesses by imposing, among other things, additional costs associated with emission limits, controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emissions credits. Similarly, SB 350 requires all load-serving entities, including SDG&E, to file integrated resource plans that are intended to ultimately enable the electric sector to achieve reductions in GHG emissions of 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030. Our California Utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates. Even if recoverable, the effects of existing and proposed GHG emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth and may have a material adverse effect on the California Utilities\u2019 cash flows. SDG&E may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met.\nIn addition, existing and future laws, orders and regulations regarding mercury, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, particulates, methane or other emissions could result in requirements for additional monitoring, pollution monitoring and control equipment, safety practices or emission fees, taxes or penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and/or cash flows. Moreover, existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe provide further discussion of these matters in \u201cItem 7. MD&A\u201d and in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us.\nSempra Energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings, including in connection with the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility natural gas leak. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings, and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings. We discuss pending proceedings in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. MD&A.\u201d The uncertainties\ninherent in lawsuits, arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in personal injury, product liability, property damage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable in whole or in part by insurance or in rates from our customers, which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices. In addition, for those contract positions that are hedged, our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned.\nTo reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity. As part of this strategy, we may use forward contracts, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and options. We do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions, and the coverage will vary over time. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Certain of the contracts we use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting. Such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts. In certain cases, these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged.\nRisk management procedures may not prevent losses.\nAlthough we have in place risk management and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended by our businesses or may not work as planned. In addition, daily value-at-risk and loss limits are based on historic price movements. If prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices, the limits may not protect us from significant losses. As a result of these and other factors, there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nThe operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.\nSeveral of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a company-by-company basis. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nNew business technologies implemented by us or developed by others present, among other things, a risk for increased attacks on our information systems and the integrity of our energy grid and our natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure.\nIn addition to general information and cyber risks that all Fortune 500 corporations face (e.g. malware, malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), the utility industry faces evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information, Smart Grid infrastructure, and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure. Deployment of new business technologies represents a new and large-scale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information, as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure. Additionally, we often rely on third party vendors to deploy new business technologies and maintain, modify and update our systems, including systems that manage sensitive information. These third parties could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures to protect our systems and information. While our computer systems have been, and will continue to be, subjected to computer viruses or other malware, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks, to date we have not detected a material breach of cybersecurity. Addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, including investing in risk management and information security measures to protect our systems. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated cyber risks. Despite our best efforts, our businesses may not be fully insulated from cyber-attacks and system disruptions. An attack on our information systems, the integrity of the energy grid, our natural gas, ethane, LNG, LPG or propane pipeline and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities, or unauthorized access to confidential customer information, could result in energy delivery service failures, financial and reputational loss, violations of privacy laws, customer dissatisfaction and litigation, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information. The theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation. Sempra Energy maintains cyber liability insurance, but this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions, conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised and there is no guarantee that the insurance that we do maintain will continue to be available at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable.\nFurther, as seen with recent cyber-attacks around the world, the goal of a cyber-attack may be primarily to inflict large-scale harm on a company and the places where it operates. Any such cyber-attack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating, financial and administrative systems, including the destruction of critical information and programming that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid, negatively impact our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements or comply with ongoing disclosure obligations or other regulatory requirements, and/or release confidential information about our company and our customers, employees and other constituents, any of which could lead to sanctions or negatively affect the general perception of our business in the financial markets and which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nRisks Related to the California Utilities\nThe California Utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state, federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities, which may materially adversely affect us.\nThe CPUC regulates the California Utilities\u2019 rates, except SDG&E\u2019s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the FERC. The CPUC also regulates the California Utilities\u2019:\n\u25aa\nconditions of service;\n\u25aa\nsales of securities;\n\u25aa\nrates of return;\n\u25aa\ncapital structure;\n\u25aa\nrates of depreciation; and\n\u25aa\nlong-term resource procurement.\nThe CPUC conducts various reviews and audits of utility operations, safety standards and practices, compliance with CPUC regulations and standards, affiliate relationships and other matters. These reviews and audits may result in disallowances, fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. SoCalGas and SDG&E may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and storage and, for SDG&E, electric operations, under regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. We discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to the California Utilities\u2019 rates, costs, incentive mechanisms and performance-based regulation in Notes 4, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. MD&A.\u201d\nThe CPUC periodically approves the California Utilities\u2019 rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investment, as well as settlements. Delays by the CPUC on decisions authorizing recovery or denying recovery, after-the-fact reasonableness reviews with unclear standards, authorizations for less than full recovery or rejection of their settlements may adversely affect the working capital, cash flows and financial condition of each of the California Utilities. If the California Utilities receive an adverse CPUC decision and/or actual capital expenditures and/or operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the CPUC, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nSoCalGas and SDG&E have significantly invested and continue to invest in major programs, such as PSEP, under an approved CPUC decision tree framework. However, the total investment to date is substantially subject to CPUC reasonableness review. Although we believe these costs have been prudently incurred, the standards applied by the CPUC could result in the disallowance of a portion of these historical costs, which could adversely affect SDG&E\u2019s, SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe CPUC now incorporates a risk-based decision-making framework in its review of GRC applications for major natural gas and electric utilities in California. We cannot estimate whether its application in the 2019 GRC or future GRC applications will result in full recovery of costs. We discuss this further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn California, there are laws that establish rules governing, among other subjects, communications between CPUC officials, CPUC staff and regulated utilities. Rules and processes around ex parte communications could result in delayed decisions, increased investigations, enforcement actions and penalties. In addition, the CPUC or other parties may initiate investigations of past communications between public utilities and CPUC officials and staff that could result in reopening completed proceedings for reconsideration.\nThe FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E.\nThe California Utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. In addition, existing legislation or regulations may be revised or reinterpreted. New, revised or reinterpreted legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations could change how the California Utilities operate, could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses. In September 2018, the Governor of California signed into law SB 901, which includes a number of measures primarily intended to address certain wildfire risks relevant to consumers and utilities and guidelines for the CPUC to determine whether utilities acted reasonably in order to recover costs related to wildfires. Among other things, SB 901 also contains provisions for utility issuance of recovery bonds with respect to certain wildfire costs, subject to CPUC approval. SB 901 did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which imposes strict liability on a utility (meaning that the utility may be found liable regardless of fault) whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire. We are unable to predict how the CPUC will apply SB 901 and its impact on the California Utilities\u2019 ability to recover certain costs and expenses in cases where the California Utilities\u2019 equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation.\nThe construction and expansion of the California Utilities\u2019 natural gas pipelines, SoCalGas\u2019 storage facilities and SDG&E\u2019s electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits, licenses, rights-of-way and other approvals from federal, state and local governmental agencies, including approvals and renewals of rights-of-way over Native American tribal land held in trust by the federal government. Successfully maintaining or renewing any or all of these approvals could result in higher costs or, in the event one or more of these approvals were to expire, could require us to remove the associated assets from service, construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area, or both, and our ability to recover higher costs associated with these events cannot be assured. If there are delays in obtaining these approvals, failure to obtain or maintain these approvals, difficulties in renewing rights-of-way and other property rights, or failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, the California Utilities\u2019 businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects could be adversely affected.\nSuccessfully coordinating and completing expansion and construction projects requires good execution from our employees and contractors, cooperation of third parties and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay. In the event that one or more of these projects is delayed or experiences significant cost overruns, this could have a material adverse effect on the California Utilities. The California Utilities may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval. If the project does not receive regulatory approval, if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes, or if management decides not to proceed with the project, they may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project, which could materially adversely affect their financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur California Utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as TURN, Utility Consumers\u2019 Action Network, Sierra Club and other stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups. Operations that may be influenced by these groups include:\n\u25aa\nthe rates and rate design used to charge to our customers;\n\u25aa\nour ability to site and construct new facilities;\n\u25aa\nour ability to purchase, construct or enter into other arrangements with generating facilities;\n\u25aa\nour ability to shut down power for safety reasons, including potentially dangerous wildfire conditions;\n\u25aa\ngeneral safety;\n\u25aa\naccounting and income tax matters, including changes in tax law;\n\u25aa\ntransactions between affiliates;\n\u25aa\nthe installation of environmental emission controls equipment;\n\u25aa\nour ability to decommission generating and other facilities and recover the remaining carrying value of such facilities and related costs;\n\u25aa\nour ability to recover costs incurred in connection with nuclear decommissioning activities from trust funds established to pay for such costs;\n\u25aa\nthe amount of certain sources of energy we must use, such as renewable sources; limits on the amount of certain energy sources we can use, such as natural gas; and programs to encourage reductions in energy usage by customers; and\n\u25aa\nthe amount of costs associated with these and other operations that may be recovered from customers.\nExtreme weather conditions, changing weather patterns and population growth in areas of the State of California in environments with historically higher risk of wildfires could materially affect the California Utilities\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nFrequent and more severe drought conditions, unseasonably warm temperatures and stronger winds have increased the degree and prevalence of wildfires in California including in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 service territories, which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy and reduce the availability of hydroelectric generators. This could result in temporary power shortages in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 service territories and/or catastrophic destruction of third party property for which SDG&E or SoCalGas may be liable and unable to recover from ratepayers or may have inadequate insurance coverage. SB 901, signed into law in 2018, includes a number of measures primarily intended to address certain wildfire risks relevant to consumers and utilities and guidelines for the CPUC to determine whether utilities acted reasonably in order to recover costs related to wildfires. However, in the event of a significant wildfire involving SDG&E equipment, SB 901 may not be sufficient to enable timely access to capital necessary to address, in whole or in part, inverse condemnation liabilities, or could result in the inability to pass such liabilities through to customers even if SDG&E complies with its wildfire mitigation plans. In addition to these changing environmental conditions, the State of California has been subject to housing shortages such that certain local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed in certain cases to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high risk fire areas that may not have the infrastructure or contingency plans necessary to address such risk. In addition, severe weather conditions could result in delays and/or cost increases to our capital projects.\nSevere rainstorms and associated high winds in our service territories, as well as flooding and mudslides where vegetation has been destroyed as result of human modification or wildfires, could damage our electric and natural gas infrastructure, resulting in increased expenses, including higher maintenance and repair costs and interruptions in electricity and natural gas delivery services. As a result, these events can have significant financial consequences, including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the California Utilities encounter difficulties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis. Further, the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the California Utilities\u2019 facilities, including gas and electric transmission and distribution assets. The California Utilities could incur substantial costs to repair or replace these facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries.\nEvents or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the California Utilities\u2019 operations than the California Utilities currently anticipate. If the CPUC fails to adjust the California Utilities\u2019 rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change or if a major fire is determined to be caused by our equipment, Sempra Energy\u2019s and the California Utilities\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nInsurance coverage for future wildfires may be unobtainable, prohibitively expensive or insufficient to cover losses we may incur, and we may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms.\nWe have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the California Utilities\u2019 operations, particularly SDG&E\u2019s operations. In addition, the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. California courts have invoked the doctrine of inverse condemnation for wildfire damages, whereby if a utility company\u2019s equipment, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be a cause of one or more fires, the utility could be held strictly liable for damages, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees, without having been found negligent. As a result of the strict liability standard applied to wildfires, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be available or may be available only at rates that are prohibitively expensive. In addition, even if insurance for wildfire liabilities is available, it may not be available in such amounts as are necessary to cover potential losses. A loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates, which was the result in a decision by the CPUC denying SDG&E\u2019s recovery of costs for the 2007 wildfires, could materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and one or both of the California Utilities\u2019 financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We are unable to predict whether we would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.\nThe California Utilities are subject to risks arising from the operation and improvement of their electricity and natural gas infrastructure and information technology systems, which, if they materialize, could adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and the California Utilities\u2019 financial results.\nThe California Utilities own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas storage facilities, which are, in many cases, interconnected and/or managed by information technology systems. The California Utilities undertake substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, improve and upgrade these facilities and systems, but while these capital investment projects are in process and even once completed, there is a risk of, among other things, potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and information technology systems, human error in operations or maintenance, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. In addition, as discussed above, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution delivery systems. Because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.\nAdditional risks associated with the ability of the California Utilities to safely and reliably operate, maintain, improve and upgrade their facilities and systems, many of which are beyond the California Utilities\u2019 control, include:\n\u25aa\nchallenges associated with meeting customer demand for electricity and/or natural gas that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life;\n\u25aa\na prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the California Utilities\u2019 equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties;\n\u25aa\ninadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that could lead to public or employee harm or extended outages; severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events or other natural disasters;\n\u25aa\nthe release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; and\n\u25aa\nattacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism or war.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages; damage the California Utilities\u2019 assets and/or operations; damage the assets and/or operations of third parties on which the California Utilities rely; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the California Utilities could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any such events could materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and one or both of the California Utilities\u2019 financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nSoCalGas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to the natural gas leak at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility and mitigating local community environmental impacts from the Leak, some or a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance, and SoCalGas also may incur significant liabilities for damages, restitution, fines, penalties and other costs, and emissions mitigation activities as a result of this incident, some or a significant portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance or may exceed insurance coverage.\nIn October 2015, SoCalGas discovered a leak at one of its injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, located in the northern part of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County, California. SS25 is one of more than 100 injection-and-withdrawal wells at the storage facility. SoCalGas worked closely with several of the world\u2019s leading experts to stop the Leak, and in February 2016, DOGGR confirmed that the well was permanently sealed.\nLocal Community Mitigation Efforts\nPursuant to directives by the DPH and orders by the LA Superior Court, SoCalGas provided temporary relocation support to residents in the nearby community who requested it, at significant cost to SoCalGas. These programs ended in July 2016.\nIn May 2016, the DPH issued a directive that SoCalGas additionally professionally clean (in accordance with the proposed protocol prepared by the DPH) the homes of all residents located within the Porter Ranch Neighborhood Council boundary, or who participated in the relocation program, or who are located within a five-mile radius of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility and experienced symptoms from the Leak (the Directive). SoCalGas disputes the Directive, contending that it is invalid and unenforceable, and has filed a petition for writ of mandate to set aside the Directive.\nThe costs incurred to remediate and stop the Leak and to mitigate local community impacts have been significant and may increase, and we may be subject to potentially significant damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs. To the extent any of these costs are not covered by insurance (including any costs in excess of\napplicable policy limits), or if there are significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries, such amounts could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nCivil and Criminal Litigation\nAs of February 21, 2019, 393 lawsuits, including approximately 48,000 plaintiffs, are pending against SoCalGas, some of which have also named Sempra Energy.\nFive shareholder derivative actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties have been filed against certain officers and directors of Sempra Energy and/or SoCalGas, four of which were joined in a Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint in August 2017. Three complaints have also been filed by public entities, including the California Attorney General and the County of Los Angeles. These complaints seek various remedies, including injunctive relief, abatement of the public nuisance, civil penalties, payment of the cost of a longitudinal health study and money damages, as well as punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. Additional litigation may be filed against us in the future related to the Leak or our responses thereto. In August 2018, SoCalGas entered into an agreement to settle these public entity actions, which was approved by the LA Superior Court in February 2019. These various lawsuits have been coordinated before a single court and will be managed under master complaints.\nAdditionally, a misdemeanor criminal complaint was filed by the LA County District Attorney\u2019s office, as to which SoCalGas entered a settlement that was approved by the LA Superior Court but is subject to appeal by certain residents. In addition, a federal securities class action alleging violation of the federal securities laws was filed against Sempra Energy and certain of its officers and directors in the SDCA. This complaint was dismissed by the court in March 2018, and in December 2018, the court declined to reconsider its order. For a more detailed description of the civil and criminal lawsuits brought against us, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe costs of defending against the civil and criminal lawsuits, cooperating with these investigations, and any damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs, if awarded or imposed, as well as the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released, could be significant and to the extent not covered by insurance (including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits), if there were to be significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries, or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible, such amounts could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural Gas Storage Operations and Regulatory Proceedings\nNatural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods, including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, with a storage capacity of 86 Bcf (which represents 63 percent of SoCalGas\u2019 natural gas storage inventory capacity), is the largest SoCalGas storage facility and an important element of SoCalGas\u2019 delivery system. As a result of the Leak, beginning October 24, 2015, pursuant to orders by DOGGR and the Governor of the State of California, and SB 380, SoCalGas suspended injection of natural gas into the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility. In February 2017, the CPUC opened a proceeding pursuant to SB 380 to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region. The order establishing the scope of the proceeding expressly excludes issues with respect to air quality, public health, causation, culpability or cost responsibility regarding the Leak. Following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by DOGGR and the CPUC\u2019s Executive Director, SoCalGas resumed limited injection operations in July 2017. Limited withdrawals of natural gas from the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility began in 2017 and continued in 2018 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods. In January 2019, the CPUC concluded Phase 1 of the proceeding initiated in February 2017 by establishing a framework for the hydraulic, production cost and economic modeling assumptions for the potential reduction in usage or elimination of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility. Phase 2 of the proceeding began in the first quarter of 2019 and will evaluate the impacts of reducing or eliminating the usage of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility using the established framework and models.\nIf the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed, or if future cash flows were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs and/or additional capital expenditures, and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. At December 31, 2018, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of $724 million. Any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded. Higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by SoCalGas may not be recoverable in customer rates, and SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nGovernmental Investigations, Orders and Additional Regulation\nVarious governmental agencies, including DOE, DOGGR, DPH, SCAQMD, CARB, Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, CPUC, PHMSA, EPA, Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office and California Attorney General\u2019s Office, have investigated or are investigating this incident. In January 2016, DOGGR and the CPUC selected Blade Energy Partners to conduct, under their supervision, an independent analysis of the technical root cause of the Leak, to be funded by SoCalGas. The root cause analysis is ongoing, and its timing is under the control of Blade Energy Partners, DOGGR and the CPUC.\nIn March 2016, the CARB issued its recommended approach to achieve full mitigation of the emissions from the Leak, and in October 2016, issued its report concluding that SoCalGas should mitigate 109,000 metric tons of methane to fully mitigate the GHG impacts of the Leak. This mitigation will be achieved through a mitigation agreement SoCalGas has entered in connection with its settlement of public entity complaints. For a more detailed description of the settlement, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPHMSA, DOGGR, SCAQMD, EPA and CARB have each commenced separate rulemaking proceedings to adopt further regulations covering natural gas storage facilities and injection wells. DOGGR has issued new draft regulations for all storage fields in California, and in 2016, the California Legislature enacted four separate bills providing for additional regulation of natural gas storage facilities. Additional hearings in the California Legislature, as well as with various other federal and state regulatory agencies, may be scheduled, and additional laws, orders, rules and regulations may be adopted.\nHigher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by SoCalGas as a result of new laws, orders, rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates, and SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any such new laws, orders, rules and regulations.\nInsurance and Estimated Costs\nExcluding directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, we have at least four kinds of insurance policies that together provide between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in insurance coverage, depending on the nature of the claims. These policies are subject to various policy limits, exclusions and conditions. We intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred or may incur. Through December 31, 2018, we have received $566 million of insurance proceeds for portions of control-of-well expenses, lost gas, temporary relocation, and other costs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for costs related to the Leak under the applicable policies, and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining additional recovery or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage, such costs could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial conditions and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2018, SoCalGas estimates that its costs related to the Leak are $1,055 million, which includes $1,027 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance. This estimate may rise significantly as more information becomes available. In addition, costs not included in the cost estimate of $1,055 million could be material. As described in \u201cCivil and Criminal Litigation\u201d above, the actions against us seek compensatory and punitive damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs, which except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions, are not included in the $1,055 million cost estimate as it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the amount of damages, restitution or civil, administrative or criminal fines, penalties or other costs. The recorded amounts above also do not include costs to clean additional homes pursuant to the Directive, future legal costs to defend litigation, and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate. Furthermore, the cost estimate of $1,055 million does not include certain other costs incurred by Sempra Energy through December 31, 2018 associated with defending shareholder derivative lawsuits. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining insurance coverage for these costs under the applicable policies, and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage, such costs could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional Information\nWe discuss Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility matters further in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Factors Influencing Future Performance.\u201d\nNatural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates.\nPending the outcome of various regulatory agency evaluations of natural gas pipeline safety regulations, practices and procedures, Sempra Energy, including the California Utilities, may incur incremental expense and capital investment associated with their natural gas pipeline operations and investments. The California Utilities filed implementation plans with the CPUC to test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines located in populated areas that either have not been pressure tested or lack sufficient documentation of a pressure test, to enhance existing valve infrastructure and to retrofit pipelines to allow for the use of in-line inspection technology, referred to as SoCalGas\u2019 and SDG&E\u2019s PSEP.\nIn June 2014, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the utilities\u2019 plan for implementing PSEP and established criteria to determine the amounts related to PSEP that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts, including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review. In the future, certain PSEP costs may be subject to recovery as determined by separate regulatory filings with the CPUC, including GRC filings.\nVarious PSEP-related proceedings are regularly pending before the CPUC regarding the California Utilities\u2019 reasonableness review and cost recovery requests, which are often challenged by intervening parties. These proceedings are described in more detail in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Factors Influencing Future Performance.\u201d In the future, consumer advocacy groups may similarly challenge the California Utilities\u2019 petitions for recovery and recommend disallowances in whole or in part with respect to applications to recover PSEP costs.\nFrom 2011 through 2018, SoCalGas and SDG&E have invested approximately $1.5 billion and $372 million, respectively, in PSEP, with substantial additional expenditures planned. As of December 31, 2018, SoCalGas has received approval for recovery of $33 million. If the CPUC denies or significantly delays rate recovery for PSEP and other gas pipeline safety costs incurred by SoCalGas and SDG&E, it could materially adversely affect the respective company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe California Utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either SDG&E or SoCalGas to be out of compliance.\nSB 291 requires the CPUC to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring, data tracking and analysis, and investigations, and delegates citation authority to CPUC staff personnel under the direction of the CPUC Executive Director. In exercising this citation authority, the CPUC staff is to take into account voluntary reporting of potential violations, voluntary resolution efforts undertaken, prior history of violations, the gravity of the violation and the degree of culpability. The CPUC previously implemented both electric and gas safety enforcement programs whereby electric and gas utilities may be cited by CPUC staff for violations of the CPUC\u2019s safety requirements or applicable federal standards.\nUnder each enforcement program, each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense. The maximum penalty is $50,000 per offense. CPUC staff has authority to issue citations up to an administrative limit of $8 million per citation under either program and such citations may be appealed to the CPUC. Although citations issued under these enforcement programs do include an administrative limit, penalties issued by the CPUC can exceed this limit, having exceeded $1.5 billion in one instance for an unrelated third party.\nIf the CPUC or its staff determine that either of SDG&E\u2019s or SoCalGas\u2019 operations and practices are not in compliance with applicable safety standards and operating procedures, the corrective or mitigation actions required to be in conformance, if not sufficiently funded in customer rates, and any penalties imposed, could materially adversely affect that company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe failure by the CPUC to continue reforms of SDG&E\u2019s rate structure, including the implementation of charges independent of consumption volume and reforms to reduce NEM rate subsidies, could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe current electric residential rate structure in California is primarily based on consumption volume, which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers.\nThe NEM program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of on-site renewable generation (primarily solar installations). Under NEM, qualifying customer-generators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed to the utility\u2019s power grid. This occurs during times when the customer\u2019s generation exceeds their own energy usage (wholesale rates apply only if a customer\u2019s annual generation exceeds their annual consumption). Under this structure, NEM customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain limitations, while they still receive electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. The unpaid NEM costs are subsidized by customers not participating in NEM. Accordingly, as higher electric-use residential customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on the remaining customers increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation, further increasing rate pressure on existing customers.\nSDG&E implemented a successor NEM tariff in July 2016, after reaching the 617-MW cap established for the original NEM program. The successor NEM tariff requires NEM customers to pay some costs that would otherwise be borne by non-NEM customers and moves new NEM customers to TOU rates. These changes to the NEM program begin a process of reducing the cost burden on non-NEM customers, but SDG&E believes that further reforms are necessary and appropriate. In a January 2016 decision, the CPUC committed to revisit the NEM successor tariff and the adequacy of its NEM reforms, and we expect the review to begin in the second half of 2019.\nThe status of broader rate reform was established in July 2015, when the CPUC adopted a decision that provides a framework for rates that are more transparent, fair and sustainable. The decision provides for a minimum monthly bill, fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates, directs the utilities to pursue expanded TOU rates and implemented a super-user electric surcharge for usage that exceeds the baseline amount of energy used by customers by approximately 400 percent. The decision is being implemented over a five-year period from 2015 to 2020. The decision should result in relief for higher-use customers that do not exceed the super-user threshold and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers. The decision also establishes a process for utilities to seek implementation of a fixed charge for residential customers in 2020 (but it also sets certain conditions for the implementation of a fixed charge), after the initial reforms are implemented. We believe the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers may become more critical to help ensure rates are fair for all customers. Distributed energy resources and energy efficiency initiatives could generally reduce delivered volumes, increasing the importance of a fixed charge. In addition, the continuing increase of solar installations and other forms of self-generation adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system and could increase fixed costs.\nIf the CPUC fails to continue to reform SDG&E\u2019s rate structure to maintain reasonable, cost-based electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system, such failure could lead to the disallowance of recovery for our costs, including power procurement costs, operating or capital costs, or the imposition of fines and penalties. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of distributed energy resources, technological advancements, and political and regulatory developments.\nElectric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources, such as solar, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies. This growth will eventually require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid\u2019s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources. The CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate various demonstration projects and pilots; implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources; consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation would be appropriate; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. These proceedings may result in new regulations, policies and/or operational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nSDG&E provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a long-term basis. While SDG&E provides such procurement service for most of its customer load, customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than SDG&E, through programs such as DA and CCA. DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. Utility customers could also receive procurement through CCA, if the customer\u2019s local jurisdiction (city) offers such a program. Several local political jurisdictions, including the City of San Diego and other municipalities, are considering or implementing a CCA, which could result in the departure of more than half of SDG&E\u2019s bundled load. When customers are served by another load serving entity, SDG&E no longer serves this departing load and the associated costs of the utility\u2019s procured resources could be borne by its remaining bundled procurement customers. State law requires that customers opting to have a CCA procure their electricity must absorb the cost of above-market electricity procurement commitments already made by SDG&E on their behalf. If adequate mechanisms are not maintained to ensure compliance with state law, remaining bundled customers of SDG&E could potentially experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of CCA customers prior to their departure, which may not be fully recoverable in rates by SDG&E. If legislative, regulatory or legal action were taken to prevent the timely recovery of these procurement costs or if mechanisms are not in place to ensure compliance with state law, the unrecovered costs could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural gas and natural gas storage used in California to generate electricity has increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny, including a desire by some to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source.\nCalifornia legislators and stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable energy and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas. A substantial reduction or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in California could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s, SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nSDG&E may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned.\nSDG&E has a 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS, formerly a 2,150-MW nuclear generating facility near San Clemente, California, that is in the process of being decommissioned by Edison, the majority owner of SONGS. SONGS is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC and the CPUC. SDG&E, and each of the other owners, holds its undivided interest as a tenant in common in the property, and each owner is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures, including decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG&E\u2019s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility, which include:\n\u25aa\nthe potential release of a radioactive material including from a natural disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami that could cause a catastrophic failure of the safety systems in place that are designed to prevent the release of radioactive material. If radioactive material is released including as a result of such failure, a substantial amount of radiation could be released and cause catastrophic harm to human health and the environment;\n\u25aa\nthe potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the prior operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;\n\u25aa\nlimitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operations and the decommissioning of the facility; and\n\u25aa\nuncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility.\nIn addition, SDG&E maintains NDTs for providing funds to decommission SONGS. Trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to significant market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates. Furthermore, CPUC approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts. CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the CPUC altogether if the CPUC determines that the expenditures are unreasonable. Finally, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur.\nInterpretations of tax regulations could impact access to NDT funds for reimbursement of spent nuclear fuel management costs. Depending on how the IRS or the U.S. Department of Treasury ultimately interprets or alters regulations addressing the taxation of a qualified NDT, SDG&E may be restricted from withdrawing amounts from its qualified decommissioning trusts to pay for spent fuel management while Edison and SDG&E are seeking, or plan to seek, recovery of spent fuel management costs in litigation against, or in settlements with, the DOE. In December 2016, the IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued proposed regulations that clarify the definition of \u201cnuclear decommissioning costs,\u201d which are costs that may be paid for or reimbursed from a qualified trust fund. These proposed regulations will be effective prospectively once they are finalized. SDG&E is awaiting the adoption of, or additional refinement to, the proposed regulations before determining whether the proposed regulations will allow SDG&E to access the NDT funds for reimbursement or payment of the spent fuel management costs incurred in 2017 and subsequent years. Until the DOE litigation is resolved and/or IRS regulations regarding spent fuel management costs are confirmed to apply, SDG&E expects to continue to pay for its share of such spent fuel management costs. If SDG&E is unable to obtain timely access to the trusts for these costs, SDG&E\u2019s cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nRisks Related to our Businesses Other Than the California Utilities\nBusiness development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled, be completed within budget or operate at expected levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe acquisition, development, construction and expansion of LNG liquefaction, marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels, and LPG terminals and storage; natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities; electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure; and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. We may be required\nto spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, fuel supply, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built.\nSuccess in developing a project is contingent upon, among other things:\n\u25aa\nnegotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements;\n\u25aa\nnegotiation of satisfactory LNG offtake and JV agreements;\n\u25aa\nnegotiation of supply, natural gas and LNG sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements and PPAs;\n\u25aa\ntimely receipt of required governmental permits, licenses, authorizations and rights-of-way and maintenance or extension of these authorizations;\n\u25aa\ntimely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction; and\n\u25aa\nobtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project.\nSuccessful completion of a project may be materially adversely affected by, among other factors:\n\u25aa\nunforeseen engineering problems;\n\u25aa\nconstruction delays and contractor performance shortfalls;\n\u25aa\nwork stoppages;\n\u25aa\nfailure to obtain, maintain or extend required governmental permits, licenses, authorizations and rights-of-way;\n\u25aa\nequipment unavailability or delay and cost increases;\n\u25aa\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u25aa\nenvironmental and geological conditions;\n\u25aa\nlitigation; and\n\u25aa\nunsettled property rights.\nIf we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns, this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of liquefaction, regasification and storage facilities, electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure or other equipment or processes, labor disputes, fuel interruption, environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt liquefaction, generation, regasification, storage, transmission and distribution systems. The occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe design, development and construction of the Cameron LNG liquefaction facility involves numerous risks and uncertainties.\nWith respect to our project to add LNG export capability at the Cameron LNG facility, Cameron LNG JV is building an LNG export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains designed to a total nameplate capacity of 13.9 Mtpa of LNG with an expected export capability of 12 Mtpa of LNG, or approximately 1.7 Bcf per day. If the estimated construction, financing and other project costs for the facility exceed our contingency associated with the project budget adopted at the time of our final investment decision, we may have to make additional, unexpected cash contributions. The majority of the investment in the liquefaction project is project-financed and the balance is provided by the project partners. Any failure by the project partners to make their required investments on a timely basis could result in project delays and could materially adversely affect the development of the project. In addition, Sempra Energy has guaranteed a maximum of up to $3.9 billion related to the project financing and financing-related agreements. These guarantees terminate upon Cameron LNG JV achieving \u201cfinancial completion\u201d of the initial three-train liquefaction project, including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests. We anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation. If, due to Cameron LNG JV\u2019s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria, we are required to repay some or all of the $3.9 billion under our guarantees, any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nLarge-scale construction projects like the design, development and construction of the Cameron LNG JV liquefaction facility involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including among others, the potential for unforeseen engineering challenges, severe weather events, substantial construction delays and increased costs. Cameron LNG JV has a turnkey EPC contract, and if the contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the EPC contract, the project could\nface substantial construction delays and potentially significantly increased costs. If the contractor\u2019s delays or failures are serious enough to cause the contractor to default under the EPC contract, such default could result in Cameron LNG JV\u2019s engagement of a substitute contractor. Based on a number of factors, we believe it is reasonable to expect that Cameron LNG JV will start generating earnings in the middle of 2019. These factors include, among others, the terms of the settlement agreement entered into in December 2017 with the EPC contractor to settle certain contractor\u2019s claims, the EPC contractor\u2019s progress to date, the current commissioning activities, the remaining work left to be performed, the project schedules received from the EPC contractor, Cameron LNG JV\u2019s own review of the project schedules, the assumptions underlying such schedules and the inherent risks in constructing and testing facilities such as the Cameron LNG JV liquefaction facility. The inability to complete the project in accordance with the current schedule, cost overruns, and the other risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, credit ratings and/or prospects. For additional discussion of the Cameron LNG JV and of these risks and other risks relating to the development of the Cameron LNG JV liquefaction project that could adversely affect our future performance, see \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Factors Influencing Future Performance.\u201d\nWe face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated LNG export facilities.\nIn addition to the three-train Cameron LNG liquefaction facility described above, we are looking at several other LNG export terminal development opportunities, including a greenfield project in Port Arthur, Texas, two brownfield projects at our existing ECA regasification facility in Baja California, Mexico (a mid-scale and large-scale project) and an expansion of up to two additional liquefaction trains at the Cameron liquefaction facility. Each of these contemplated projects faces numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles before we can proceed with construction. Common to all these projects is the risk that global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for LNG. This could result in increased competition among those working on projects in an environment of declining LNG demand, such as the Sempra Energy-sponsored export initiatives. Such reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation, which could also lead to increased competition among the LNG suppliers for the declining LNG demand. At certain moderate levels, oil prices could also make LNG projects in other parts of the world still feasible and competitive with LNG projects from North America, thus increasing supply and the competition for the available LNG demand. A decline in natural gas prices outside the U.S. (which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil) may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices (based on Henry Hub pricing).\nSempra LNG & Midstream is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project near Port Arthur, Texas and is in discussions with the co-owners of Cameron LNG JV regarding the potential expansion of the Cameron LNG JV liquefaction facility. In addition, Sempra LNG & Midstream and IEnova are jointly developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project at IEnova\u2019s existing ECA regasification facility in Mexico.\nIn June 2018, Sempra LNG & Midstream selected Bechtel as the EPC contractor for the proposed Port Arthur liquefaction project. Bechtel is to perform the engineering, execution planning and related activities necessary to prepare, negotiate and finalize a definitive EPC contract for the project. The current arrangement with Bechtel does not commit any party to enter into a definitive EPC contract or otherwise participate in the project. In December 2018, Polish Oil & Gas Company and Port Arthur LNG entered into a definitive 20-year agreement for the sale and purchase of 2 Mtpa of LNG per year from the Port Arthur LNG liquefaction project. This sale and purchase agreement is subject to conditions precedent, including our positive final investment decision for the Port Arthur liquefaction project.\nIn November 2018, Sempra Energy and TOTAL S.A. entered into an MOU that provides a framework for cooperation for the development of the potential ECA liquefaction-export project and the potential Cameron LNG expansion project, but does not obligate any of the parties to enter into definitive agreements or participate in the project. The MOU contemplates TOTAL S.A. potentially contracting for up to approximately 9 Mtpa of LNG offtake across these two development projects and provides TOTAL S.A. the option to acquire an equity interest in the proposed ECA LNG liquefaction facility project, though the ultimate participation by TOTAL S.A. remains subject to finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors.\nIn June 2018, we selected a TechnipFMC plc and Kiewit Corporation partnership as the EPC contractor for the first phase of the potential ECA liquefaction-export project (ECA LNG Phase1). The TechnipFMC-Kiewit partnership is to perform the engineering, planning and related activities necessary to prepare, negotiate and finalize a definitive EPC contract for ECA LNG Phase 1. The current arrangement with the TechnipFMC-Kiewit partnership does not commit any party to enter into a definitive EPC contract or otherwise participate in the project.\nIn November 2018, Sempra LNG & Midstream and IEnova signed Heads of Agreements with affiliates of TOTAL S.A., Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. for ECA LNG Phase 1. We expect ECA LNG Phase 1 to be a single train liquefaction facility located within the existing LNG receipt terminal site with a capacity of approximately 2.4 Mtpa of LNG for export to global markets. Each Heads of Agreement for ECA LNG Phase 1 contemplates the parties negotiating definitive 20-year LNG sales and\npurchase agreements for the purchase of approximately 0.8 Mtpa of LNG from the ECA LNG facility, but does not obligate the parties to ultimately execute any agreements or participate in the project.\nThe ultimate participation of TOTAL S.A., Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. in the potential ECA LNG project as contemplated by the Heads of Agreements remains subject to finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors. The development of the ECA LNG Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including obtaining binding customer commitments, the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals; obtaining financing; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements, including a definitive EPC contract, equity acquisition and governance agreements, LNG sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements; reaching a final investment decision; and other factors associated with this potential investment.\nExpansion of the Cameron LNG liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the joint venture project financing agreements, including among others, timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the project lenders. Under the Cameron LNG JV equity agreements, the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners, including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner. We expect that discussions on the potential expansion will continue among all the Cameron LNG JV members. There can be no assurance that a mutually agreeable expansion structure will be agreed to unanimously by the Cameron LNG JV members, which if not accomplished in a timely manner, could materially and adversely impact the development of the expansion project. In light of this, we are unable to predict whether or when we and/or Cameron LNG JV might be able to move forward on expansion of the Cameron LNG liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains.\nAny decisions by Sempra Energy or our potential counterparties to proceed with binding agreements with respect to the potential development (or expansion) of our liquefaction projects will require, among other things, obtaining customer commitments to purchase LNG, completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each party. In addition, all our proposed projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the receipt of a number of permits and approvals; finding suitable partners and customers; obtaining financing and incentives; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements, including equity acquisition and governance agreements, natural gas supply and transportation agreements, LNG sale and purchase agreements and construction contracts; and reaching a final investment decision.\nFurthermore, there are a number of potential new projects under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in North America, in addition to ours, and given the projected global demand for LNG, the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed. With respect to our Port Arthur, Texas project, this is a greenfield site, and therefore it may not have the advantages often associated with brownfield sites. The ECA facility in Mexico is subject to on-going land and permit disputes that could make project financing difficult as well as finding suitable partners and customers. In addition, while we have completed the regulatory process for an LNG export facility in the U.S., the regulatory process in Mexico and the overlay of U.S. regulations for natural gas exports to an LNG export facility in Mexico are not well developed. There can be no assurance that such a facility could be permitted and constructed without facing significant legal challenges and uncertainties, which in turn could make project financing, as well as finding suitable partners and customers, difficult. Finally, ECA has profitable long-term regasification contracts for 100 percent of the facility\u2019s capacity through 2028, making the decision to pursue a new liquefaction facility dependent in part on whether the investment in a new liquefaction facility would, over the long term, be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts.\nThere can be no assurance that our contemplated LNG export facilities will be completed, and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated LNG export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows, results of operations and prospects.\nWe discuss these projects further in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Factors Influencing Future Performance.\u201d\nDomestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties that could increase the costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect production of LNG and reduce or eliminate LNG export opportunities and demand.\nHydraulic fracturing operations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to their operations. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict the performance of or prohibit the well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but federal agencies, including the EPA and the Bureau of Land Management of the U.S. Department of the Interior, have asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the\nSafe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. There are also certain governmental reviews that have been conducted or are underway on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices, including hydraulic fracturing. Depending on the outcome of these studies, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban such activities. Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, hydraulic fracturing operations may also be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by laws, policies and regulations of the U.S. affecting foreign trade and taxation, including U.S. trade sanctions.\nWe cannot predict whether additional federal, state, local or international laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, natural gas prices in North America could rise, which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices (based on Henry Hub pricing). Increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing, and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices, could materially adversely affect demand for LNG exports and our ability to develop commercially viable LNG export facilities beyond the three-train Cameron LNG facility currently under construction.\nOur businesses are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks. Energy-related commodity prices impact LNG liquefaction and regasification, the transport and storage of natural gas, and power generation from renewable and conventional sources, among other businesses that we operate and invest in.\nWe buy energy-related commodities from time to time for LNG terminals or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers, in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete. Our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions.\nUnanticipated changes in market prices for energy-related commodities result from multiple factors, including:\n\u25aa\nweather conditions;\n\u25aa\nseasonality;\n\u25aa\nchanges in supply and demand;\n\u25aa\ntransmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;\n\u25aa\navailability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;\n\u25aa\ncommodity production levels;\n\u25aa\nactions by oil and natural gas producing nations or organizations affecting the global supply of crude oil and natural gas;\n\u25aa\nfederal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation;\n\u25aa\nnatural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events; and\n\u25aa\nexpropriation of assets by foreign countries.\nThe FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates and over independent system operators and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate. The FERC may impose additional price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms, or terminate existing price limitations from time to time. Any such action by the FERC may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nWhen our businesses enter into fixed-price long-term contracts to provide services or commodities, they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks.\nSempra Mexico and Sempra LNG & Midstream generally endeavor to secure long-term contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities, reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure. However, if these contracts are at fixed prices, the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures, including rising operational costs, costs of labor, materials, equipment and commodities, and rising interest rates that affect financing costs. We may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects, providing for cost escalation, providing for direct pass-through of operating costs or entering into hedges. However, these measures, if implemented, may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses and/or financing costs. The failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\nIncreased competition and changes in trade policies could materially adversely affect us.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom have extensive and diversified development and/or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the natural gas pipeline, storage and LNG market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets. In Mexico, despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the CFE and other governmental agencies in connection with energy reforms, competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the U.S., Mexico or South America. In addition, as noted above, there are a number of potential new LNG liquefaction projects under construction or in the process of being developed by various project developers in North America, including our contemplated new projects, and given the projected global demand for LNG, it is likely that most of these projects will not be completed. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIn addition, the current U.S. Administration has indicated its intention to revise or replace international trade agreements, such as NAFTA. In November 2018, President Trump signed the USMCA, which, if approved by the legislatures of the U.S., Mexico and Canada, would replace NAFTA. A shift in U.S. trade policies could materially adversely affect our LNG development opportunities, as well as opportunities for trade between Mexico and the U.S.\nWe may elect not to, or may not be able to, enter into, extend or replace expiring long-term supply and sales agreements or long-term firm capacity agreements for our projects, which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competition. Such long-term contracts, once entered into, increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise.\nThe ECA LNG facility has long-term capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties. Under these agreements, customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive, store and regasify the customers\u2019 LNG. We also may enter into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified for sale to other parties. The long-term supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying LNG supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices. If the counterparties, customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the ECA LNG facility were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nFor the three-train liquefaction facility currently under construction, Cameron LNG JV has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of TOTAL S.A., Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co. Ltd., that subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility. If the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to Cameron LNG JV on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra Mexico\u2019s and Sempra LNG & Midstream\u2019s ability to enter into or replace existing long-term firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from their transportation customers, which may include our LNG facilities. A significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nThe electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built and competitive pressures increase, wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Renewables\u2019 and Sempra Mexico\u2019s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses depend on counterparties, business partners, customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to perform, we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses, and the businesses that we invest in, are exposed to the risk that counterparties, business partners, customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements. Should they fail to perform, we may be\nrequired to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such an event, we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers. In addition, many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses. The failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects. Finally, we often extend credit to counterparties and customers. While we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us.\nSempra Mexico\u2019s and Sempra LNG & Midstream\u2019s obligations and those of their suppliers for LNG supplies are contractually subject to (1) suspension or termination for \u201cforce majeure\u201d events beyond the control of the parties; and (2) substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements, which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nIn addition, we may develop and/or own some projects with other equity owners and, therefore, we may not control all material decisions with respect to those projects, as is the case with the Cameron LNG JV project. To the extent that there is disagreement amongst the project equity owners with respect to certain decisions affecting such a project, then the development, construction or operation of such project may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. Such a circumstance could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, result of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits.\nWe are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties adjacent to and properties where our ECA LNG regasification terminal in Mexico is located, as we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which our ECA LNG terminal is located, we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal, which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such terminal. In addition, our ability to convert the ECA LNG regasification terminal into an LNG liquefaction export facility may be hindered or halted by these disputes, and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very difficult. If we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related terminal, it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver electricity and natural gas.\nWe depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to:\n\u25aa\ndeliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets,\n\u25aa\nsupply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities, and\n\u25aa\nprovide retail energy services to customers.\nSempra Mexico and Sempra LNG & Midstream also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting. Sempra Mexico and Sempra LNG & Midstream also rely on specialized ships to transport LNG to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities. Sempra Renewables, Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Mexico rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities, electricity and other services to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity, natural gas supplies and LNG at then-current spot market rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur international businesses are exposed to different local, regulatory and business risks and challenges.\nIn Mexico, we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation, LPG storage and transportation facilities, ethane transportation assets, electricity generation facilities, and LNG, ethane and liquid fuels marine and inland terminals. In Peru and Chile, we own or have interests in electric transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure and operations. Developing infrastructure projects, owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant security, political, legal, regulatory and financial risks that vary by country, including:\n\u25aa\nchanges in foreign laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws and regulations, and U.S. laws and regulations, in each case, that are related to foreign operations;\n\u25aa\ngovernance by and decisions of local regulatory bodies, including setting of rates and tariffs that may be earned by our businesses;\n\u25aa\nadverse changes in market conditions and inadequate enforcement of regulations;\n\u25aa\nhigh rates of inflation;\n\u25aa\nvolatility in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and currencies of the countries in which we operate, as we discuss below;\n\u25aa\nforeign cash balances that may be unavailable to fund U.S. operations, or available only at unfavorable U.S. and/or foreign tax rates upon repatriation of such amounts or changes in tax law;\n\u25aa\nchanges in government policies or personnel;\n\u25aa\ntrade restrictions;\n\u25aa\nlimitations on U.S. company ownership in foreign countries;\n\u25aa\npermitting and regulatory compliance;\n\u25aa\nchanges in labor supply and labor relations;\n\u25aa\nadverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals, challenges to permits and approvals, difficulty in enforcing contractual and property rights, and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico and other foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25aa\nenergy policy reform that may result in adverse changes to and/or difficulty in enforcing existing contracts;\n\u25aa\nexpropriation of assets;\n\u25aa\ndestruction of property or assets;\n\u25aa\nadverse changes in the stability of the governments in the countries in which we operate;\n\u25aa\ngeneral political, social, economic and business conditions;\n\u25aa\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws;\n\u25aa\nvaluation of goodwill; and\n\u25aa\ntheft of assets.\nOur international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks. These risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and devaluations of foreign currencies. In such cases, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against a local currency could materially reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries. We may or may not choose to hedge these risks, and any hedges entered into may or may not be effective. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in significantly increased taxes in foreign countries and materially adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nWe discuss litigation related to Sempra Mexico\u2019s international energy projects in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks Related to Our Interest in Oncor\nSempra Energy could incur substantial tax liabilities if EFH\u2019s 2016 spin-off of Vistra from EFH is deemed to be taxable.\nAs part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, in 2016 EFH distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary Vistra Energy Corp. (formerly TCEH Corp. and referred to herein as Vistra) to certain creditors of TCEH LLC (the spinoff), and Vistra became an independent, publicly traded company. Vistra\u2019s spin-off from EFH was intended to qualify for partially tax-free treatment to EFH and its stockholders under Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the IRC (collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). In connection with and as a condition to the spin-off, EFH received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the Intended Tax Treatment of the spin-off, as well as tax opinions from counsel to EFH and Vistra regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the private letter ruling.\nIn connection with the signing and closing of the Merger, EFH sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS and Sempra Energy and EFH received tax opinions from their respective counsel that generally provide that the Merger will not affect the conclusions reached in, respectively, the IRS private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spin-off described above. Similar to the IRS private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spin-off, the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS and any opinions issued with respect to the Merger are based on factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings, made by Sempra Energy and EFH, now Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. and a subsidiary of Sempra Energy. If such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete, any such undertakings are not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions (which will not impact the IRS position on the transactions) are based are different from the actual facts relating to the Merger, the tax opinions and/or supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and as a result, could be successfully challenged by the IRS. If it is determined that the Merger causes the spin-off not to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, Sempra Energy, through its ownership of Sempra Texas Holdings Corp., could incur substantial tax liabilities, which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in Oncor and could have a material adverse effect on the results of\noperations, financial condition and/or prospects of Sempra Energy and on the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Should the IRS invalidate the private letter ruling and/or the supplemental private letter ruling, Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. has administrative appeal rights including the right to challenge any adverse IRS position in court.\nFailure by Oncor to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives may materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s future results and, consequently, the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the ability of Oncor to successfully execute its business strategy, including several objectives that are capital intensive, and to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry. See below under \u201cOncor\u2019s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that may require us to make additional investments in Oncor.\u201d If Oncor is not able to achieve these objectives, is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, or otherwise fails to perform in accordance with our expectations, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all and the Merger may materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and prospects of Sempra Energy and, consequently, the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nWe may issue a significant amount of equity securities to reduce our indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger, which may dilute the economic and voting interests of our current shareholders and may adversely affect the market value of our common stock and preferred stock.\nIn 2018, we issued a significant amount of equity securities to raise proceeds to fund a significant portion of the Merger Consideration and associated transaction costs and to reduce our indebtedness. As of February 26, 2019, 16,906,185 shares remain subject to future settlement under forward sale agreements, which may be settled on one or more dates specified by us occurring no later than December 15, 2019, which is the final settlement date under the agreements. Although we expect to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by the physical delivery of shares of our common stock in exchange for cash proceeds, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements. The forward sale agreements are also subject to acceleration by the forward purchasers upon the occurrence of certain events.\nIn addition, in January 2018, we issued 17,250,000 shares of our 6% mandatory convertible preferred stock, series A (the \u201cseries A preferred stock\u201d), and in July 2018, we issued 5,750,000 shares of our 6.75% mandatory convertible preferred stock, series B (the \u201cseries B preferred stock\u201d), both of which we expect will ultimately convert into common stock. Some of these equity issuances, including common stock issued upon settlement of the forward sale agreements, will likely occur in connection with the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, including indebtedness we have incurred in connection with the Merger. See below under \u201cWe incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the Merger. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts or take other actions, and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments.\u201d Although the issuance of any equity securities is subject to market conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and we may in fact issue fewer shares of any equity securities than anticipated, the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock (including shares issued upon conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and settlement of the forward sale agreements) will have the effect, and the issuance of additional equity securities may have the effect, of diluting the economic and voting interests of our common shareholders. In addition, the issuance of additional shares of common stock (including shares issued upon conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and settlement of the forward sale agreements) without a commensurate increase in our consolidated earnings would dilute, and the issuance of additional equity securities could dilute, our earnings per common share. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nWe incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the Merger. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts or take other actions, and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments.\nWe incurred significant additional indebtedness to finance a portion of the Merger Consideration and associated transaction costs. In January 2018, we issued $5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed- and variable-rate notes in various series that mature between 2019 and 2048, and we issued approximately $2.6 billion of commercial paper in February 2018 and March 2018 (the Oncor Merger Commercial Paper) to fund a portion of the Merger Consideration and associated transaction costs. We have since repaid the Oncor Merger Commercial Paper with proceeds from equity issuances and newly issued commercial paper. Our debt service obligations resulting from our aggregate indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and prospects by, among other things:\n\u25aa\nmaking it more difficult and/or costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions, because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments;\n\u25aa\nlimiting our flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in our business and the industry sectors in which we operate and, consequently, put us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u25aa\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes, which could hinder our prospects for growth and the market price of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, among other things;\n\u25aa\nmaking it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes;\n\u25aa\nimposing higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates on our current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u25aa\nrequiring that additional materially adverse terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which covenants might include, for example, limitations on additional borrowings; and\n\u25aa\nimposing specific restrictions on uses of our assets, as well as prohibitions or limitations on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, receive distributions from our subsidiaries, redeem or repurchase our stock or make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets and limit or delay our ability to carry out our capital expenditure program.\nThe Merger substantially increased our debt service obligations and in light of the ring-fencing arrangements described below under \u201cCertain ring-fencing measures, existing governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management and policies of Oncor,\u201d there can be no assurance that we will receive any cash from Oncor to assist us in servicing our indebtedness, paying dividends on our common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock or meeting our other cash needs, which may have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nWe are committed to maintaining our credit ratings at investment grade. To maintain these credit ratings, we may consider it appropriate to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness. We may seek to reduce this indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock and, possibly, other equity securities, and the settlement of sales of our common stock pursuant to our forward sale agreements, cash from operations and proceeds from asset sales, which may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our common stock. However, the issuance of any equity securities is subject to market conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities on terms that we consider acceptable or at all, or that we will be able to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness, should we elect to do so, to a level that permits us to maintain our investment grade credit ratings, which may have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management and policies of Oncor.\nVarious \u201cring-fencing\u201d measures are in place to enhance Oncor\u2019s separateness from its owners and to mitigate the risk that Oncor would be negatively impacted in the event of a bankruptcy or other adverse financial developments affecting its owners. This ring-fence creates both legal and financial separation between Oncor Holdings, Oncor and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sempra Energy and its affiliates and subsidiaries, on the other hand.\nIn accordance with the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments we made in connection with the Merger, we and Oncor are subject to various restrictions, including, among others:\n\u25aa\nThe board of directors of Oncor will consist of thirteen members, seven of which will be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange in relation to Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities and any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings (and those directors must have no material relationship with Sempra Energy or its affiliates, or any other entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings, currently or within the previous 10 years), two of which will be designated by Sempra Energy, two of which will be appointed by Oncor\u2019s minority owner, TTI, which is an investment vehicle owned by third parties unaffiliated with Sempra Energy and that owns approximately 19.75 percent of the outstanding membership interests in Oncor, and two of which will be current or former officers of Oncor;\n\u25aa\nA majority of the independent directors of Oncor must approve any annual or multi-year budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or O&M in such budget is more than a 10-percent increase or decrease from the corresponding amounts of such expenditures in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multi-year period, as applicable;\n\u25aa\nOncor shall make minimum aggregate capital expenditures equal to at least $7.5 billion over the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022 (subject to certain possible adjustments);\n\u25aa\nOncor may not pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if a majority of its independent directors or a minority member director determines that it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements;\n\u25aa\nAt all times, Oncor will remain in compliance with the debt-to-equity ratio established by the PUCT from time to time for ratemaking purposes, and Oncor will not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), if that payment would cause its debt-to-equity ratio to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT;\n\u25aa\nIf the credit rating on Oncor\u2019s senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below BBB (or the equivalent), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT;\n\u25aa\nWithout the prior approval of the PUCT, neither Sempra Energy nor any of its affiliates (excluding Oncor) will incur, guarantee or pledge assets in respect of any indebtedness that is dependent on the revenues of Oncor in more than a proportionate degree than the other revenues of Sempra Energy or on the stock of Oncor, and there will be no debt at Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. or Sempra Texas Intermediate Holding Company LLC at any time;\n\u25aa\nNeither Oncor nor Oncor Holdings will lend money to or borrow money from Sempra Energy or any of its affiliates (other than Oncor subsidiaries), or any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and neither Oncor Holdings nor Oncor will share credit facilities with Sempra Energy or any of its affiliates (other than Oncor subsidiaries), or any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor Holdings or Oncor;\n\u25aa\nOncor will not seek recovery in rates of any expenses or liabilities related to EFH\u2019s bankruptcy, or (1) any tax liabilities resulting from EFH\u2019s spinoff of its former subsidiary Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC, (2) any asbestos claims relating to non-Oncor operations of EFH or (3) any make-whole claims by holders of debt securities issued by EFH or EFIH, and Sempra Energy was required to and has filed with the PUCT a plan providing for the extinguishment of the liabilities described in items (1) through (3) above, which protects Oncor from any harm;\n\u25aa\nThere must be maintained certain \u201cseparateness measures\u201d that reinforce the financial separation of Oncor from Sempra Energy, including a requirement that dealings between Oncor, Oncor Holdings and their subsidiaries and Sempra Energy, any of Sempra Energy\u2019s other affiliates or any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor Holdings or Oncor, must be on an arm\u2019s-length basis, limitations on affiliate transactions, separate recordkeeping requirements and a prohibition on pledging Oncor assets or stock for any entity other than Oncor;\n\u25aa\nNo transaction costs or transition costs related to the Merger (excluding Oncor employee time) will be borne by Oncor\u2019s customers nor included in Oncor\u2019s rates;\n\u25aa\nSempra Energy will continue to hold indirectly at least 51 percent of the ownership interests in Oncor Holdings and Oncor for at least five years following the closing of the Merger, unless otherwise specifically authorized by the PUCT; and\n\u25aa\nOncor will provide bill credits to customers in an amount equal to 90 percent of any interest rate savings achieved due to any improvement in its credit ratings or market spreads compared to those as of June 30, 2017 until final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate case filed after PUCT Docket No. 46957 (except that savings will not be included in credits if already realized in rates); and one year after the Merger, Oncor will present a merger-synergy savings analysis to the PUCT and provide bill credits to its customers equal to 90 percent of any synergy savings until final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate proceeding after PUCT Docket No. 46957, at which time any total synergy savings shall be reflected in Oncor\u2019s rates. On September 7, 2018, Oncor filed its first semi-annual interest rate savings compliance report with the PUCT and began accruing a bill credit upon the issuance of its new debt in August 2018.\nAs a result of the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments, we do not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and we have limited ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions. We have limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor board of directors, which are controlled by independent directors. The existence of the ring-fencing measures and other limitations may increase our costs of financing. Further, the Oncor directors have considerable autonomy and, as described in our commitments, have a duty to act in the best interest of Oncor consistent with the approved ring-fence and Delaware law, which may be contrary to our best interests or be in opposition to our preferred strategic direction for Oncor. To the extent that they take actions that are not in our interests, the financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects of Sempra Energy may be materially adversely affected.\nIf Oncor fails to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry, including changes in regulation, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, and this could materially adversely affect us.\nBecause Oncor is regulated by both U.S. federal and Texas state authorities, it has been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. The costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory requirements and adjusting Oncor\u2019s business to legislative and regulatory developments may have a material adverse effect on Oncor. Moreover, potential legislative changes, regulatory changes or other market or industry changes may create greater risks to the predictability of utility earnings generally. If Oncor does not successfully respond to these changes, it could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nOncor\u2019s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that may require us to make additional investments in Oncor.\nOncor\u2019s business is capital intensive, and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the past, Oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs with the proceeds from indebtedness. In the event that Oncor fails to meet its capital requirements, we may be required to make additional investments in Oncor. Similarly, if Oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs, we may elect to make additional investments in Oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In that regard, our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor. As a result, if Oncor requires additional financing and cannot obtain it from other sources, we may be required to make a capital contribution, rather than a loan, to Oncor.\nSettlement provisions contained in our equity forward sale agreements subject us to certain risks.\nThe counterparties to the January forward sale agreements and the July forward sale agreements (collectively, the forward purchasers) have the right to accelerate their respective forward sale agreements (or, in certain cases, the portion thereof that they determine is affected by the relevant event) and require us to physically settle such forward sale agreements on a date specified by the forward purchasers if:\n\u25aa\nthey are unable to establish, maintain or unwind their hedge position with respect to the forward sale agreements;\n\u25aa\nthey determine that they are unable to, or it is commercially impracticable for them to, continue to borrow a number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of shares of our common stock underlying the forward sale agreements or that, with respect to borrowing such number of shares of our common stock, they would incur a rate that is greater than the borrow cost specified in the forward sale agreements, subject to a prior notice requirement;\n\u25aa\nwe declare or pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in an amount in excess of amounts, or at a time before, those prescribed by the forward sale agreements or declare or pay certain other types of dividends or distributions on shares of our common stock;\n\u25aa\nan event is announced that, if consummated, would result in an extraordinary event (including certain mergers and tender offers, our nationalization, our insolvency and the delisting of the shares of our common stock);\n\u25aa\nan ownership event (as such term is defined in the forward sale agreements) occurs; or\n\u25aa\ncertain other events of default, termination events or other specified events occur, including, among other things, a change in law.\nThe forward purchasers\u2019 decision to exercise their right to accelerate the forward sale agreements (or, in certain cases, the portion thereof that they determine is affected by the relevant event) and to require us to settle the forward sale agreements will be made irrespective of our interests, including our need for capital. In such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver our common stock under the terms of the physical settlement provisions of the forward sale agreements irrespective of our capital needs, which would result in dilution to our EPS and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, our mandatory convertible preferred stock, any other equity that we may issue and our debt securities.\nThe forward sale agreements provide for settlement on a settlement date or dates to be specified at our discretion, but which we expect to occur in one or more additional settlements on or prior to December 15, 2019. Subject to the provisions of the forward sale agreements, delivery of our shares upon physical or net share settlement of the forward sale agreements will result in dilution to our EPS and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, mandatory convertible preferred stock and any other equity that we may issue.\nWe may elect, subject to certain conditions, cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements if we conclude that it is in our interest to do so. For example, we may conclude that it is in our interest to cash settle or net share settle the forward sale agreements if we otherwise have no current use for all or a portion of the net proceeds due upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements.\nIf we elect to cash or net share settle all or a portion of the shares of our common stock underlying the forward sale agreements, we would expect the forward purchasers or one of their affiliates to purchase the number of shares necessary, based on the number of shares with respect to which we have elected cash or net share settlement, in order to satisfy their obligation to return the shares of our common stock they had borrowed in connection with sales of our common stock related to each underlying stock offering and, if applicable in connection with net share settlement, to deliver shares of our common stock to us or take into account shares of our common stock to be delivered by us, as applicable. The purchase of our common stock by the forward purchasers or their affiliates to unwind the forward purchasers\u2019 hedge positions could cause the price of our common stock to increase over time, thereby increasing the amount of cash or the number of shares of our common stock that we would owe to the forward purchasers upon cash settlement or net share settlement, as the case may be, of the forward sale agreements, or decreasing the amount of cash\nor the number of shares of our common stock that the forward purchasers owe us upon cash settlement or net share settlement, as the case may be, of the forward sale agreements.\nDividend requirements associated with the mandatory convertible preferred stock Sempra Energy issued in connection with the Merger subject us to certain risks.\nAny future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends we pay, on our series A preferred stock and our series B preferred stock will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations, and the ability of our subsidiaries and investments to distribute cash to us, as well as other factors that our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock when due would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us, under the terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock.\nThe terms of the series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock provide that if dividends on any shares of the mandatory convertible preferred stock (i) have not been declared and paid, or (ii) have been declared but a sum of cash or number of shares of our common stock sufficient for payment thereof has not been set aside for the benefit of the holders thereof on the applicable record date, in each case, for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other classes or series of our preferred stock ranking equally with the mandatory convertible preferred stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up and having similar voting rights, will be entitled to elect a total of two additional members of our board of directors, subject to certain terms and limitations described in the certificate of determination applicable to the mandatory convertible preferred stock.\nOther Risks\nSempra Energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control.\nSempra Energy makes investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control. As described above, SDG&E holds a 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS, which is in the process of being decommissioned by Edison, its majority owner. As a result of ring-fencing measures, existing governance mechanisms and commitments, we account for our indirect, 100-percent ownership interest in Oncor Holdings, which owns an 80.25 percent interest in Oncor, as an equity method investment, which investment is $9,652 million at December 31, 2018. Sempra LNG & Midstream accounts for its investment in the Cameron LNG JV under the equity method, which investment is $1,271 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, Sempra Renewables had investments totaling $291 million in several JVs to operate wind generation facilities. Sempra Mexico has a 40-percent interest in a JV with a subsidiary of TransCanada to build, own and operate the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan natural gas marine pipeline in Mexico, a 50-percent interest in a renewables wind project in Baja California, and a 50-percent interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline in Mexico. At December 31, 2018, these various JV investments by Sempra Mexico totaled $747 million. Sempra Energy has an equity method investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities partnership which is in the process of being dissolved and for which Sempra Energy is subject to certain indemnities as we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Any adverse resolution of matters associated with our remaining investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities partnership could have a corresponding impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nSempra Energy committed to make a capital contribution to Oncor for Oncor to fund its acquisition of InfraREIT, which acquisition we expect will close in mid-2019. We estimate the capital contribution to be $1,025 million, excluding our share of the approximately $40 million for a management agreement termination fee, as well as other customary transaction costs incurred by InfraREIT that would be borne by Oncor as part of the acquisition. The capital contribution is contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the substantially simultaneous closing of the transactions contemplated by the InfraREIT Merger Agreement. We discuss these transactions in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Factors Influencing Future Performance.\u201d\nSempra Mexico and Sempra LNG & Midstream have provided guarantees related to JV financing agreements, and Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Mexico have provided loans to JVs in which they have investments and to other affiliates. We discuss the guarantees in Note 6 and affiliate loans in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest. In addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses, if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the\nbusinesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss our investments further in Notes 5, 6 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMarket performance or changes in other assumptions could require Sempra Energy, SDG&E and/or SoCalGas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nSempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees. A decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans. In addition, the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including the assumed rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nImpairment of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Sempra Energy had approximately $2.4 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3.9 percent of the total assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to the acquisitions of IEnova Pipelines and Ventika in Mexico, Chilquinta Energ\u00eda in Chile and Luz Del Sur in Peru. Goodwill is not amortized, but we test it for impairment annually on October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation, which could result in our recording a goodwill impairment loss. We discuss our annual goodwill impairment testing process and the factors considered in such testing in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A goodwill impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded.", "PERMNO": 86136, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "SRE"}
