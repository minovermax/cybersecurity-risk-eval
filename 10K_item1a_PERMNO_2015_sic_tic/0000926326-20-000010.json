{"cik": "926326", "company": "OMNICELL, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could suffer and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIn assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\nIf we fail to develop new products or enhance our existing products to react to rapid technological change and market demands in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if more newly developed solutions, such as our XT Series, XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System, and IVX Workflow, are not adopted in the same time frame and/or quantity as we anticipate, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe must develop new products or enhance our existing products with improved technologies to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements. We are constantly engaged in the development process for next generation products, and we need to successfully design our next generation and other products for customers who continually require higher performance and functionality at lower costs. The development process for these advancements is lengthy and usually requires us to accurately anticipate technological innovations and market trends. Developing and enhancing these products can be time-consuming, costly, and complex. Our ability to fund product development and enhancements partially depends on our ability to generate revenues from our existing products.\nThere is a risk that these new product developments, such as our XT Series, XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System and IVX semi-automated workflow solution, or product enhancements, will be late, will have technical problems, will fail to meet customer or market specifications or will not be competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable performance and functionality. For example, we experienced technical quality issues with respect to early shipments of our XT Series automated dispensing systems to customers. These issues required significant resources to analyze the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions. We may discover technical quality issues in the future related to new products, or product enhancements, that require analysis and corrective action, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile our business strategy includes a goal of advancing our platform with new product introductions annually, we may be unable to successfully develop additional next generation products, new products or product enhancements on an annual basis or at all. Our next generation products, such as our XT Series, or any of our newer products, such as our XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System or IVX Workflow, or product enhancements may not be accepted in new or existing markets.\nOur ability to execute successfully on our recently-launched vision of a fully digitized and autonomous pharmacy depends on our ability to continue to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements, and integrate new products with existing offerings, in furtherance of this vision in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis. If we fail to do so, we may be unable to achieve the vision of the autonomous pharmacy, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in support of this vision, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources and/or existing business relationships with our current and potential customers.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We expect continued and increased competition from current and future competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Our current direct competitors in the medication management automation solutions market include Becton, Dickinson and Company; ARxIUM; Cerner Corporation; Swisslog Healthcare as a division of KUKA; Cardinal Health, Inc.; PAR Excellence Systems, Inc.; TECSYS Inc.; Baxter Healthcare Corporation; Grifols, S.A.; Willach Pharmacy Solutions; DIH Technologies Corporation; Yuyama Co., Ltd; RoboPharma B.V.; Meditech-Pharma; Knapp AG; KLS Steuerungstechnik GmbH; Gollmann Kommissioniersysteme GmbH, and Loccioni. Our current direct competitors in the medication adherence\nsolutions market include Drug Package, Inc.; ARxIUM; Manchac Technologies, LLC; RX Systems, Inc.; McKesson Corporation; Digital Pharmacist Inc.; Tabula Rasa Healthcare, Inc. (through its acquisition of PrescribeWellness); Synergy Medical Systems; Parata Systems; and Medicine-On-Time in the United States, and Jones Packaging Ltd.; Synergy Medical Systems; and WebsterCare outside the United States.\nThe competitive challenges we face in the markets in which we operate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022certain competitors may offer or have the ability to offer a broader range of solutions in the marketplace that we are unable to match;\n\u2022certain competitors may develop alternative solutions to the customer problems our products are designed to solve that may provide a better customer outcome or a lower cost of operation;\n\u2022certain competitors may develop new features or capabilities for their products not previously offered that could compete directly with our products;\n\u2022competitive pressures could result in increased price competition for our products and services, fewer customer orders, and reduced gross margins, any of which could harm our business;\n\u2022current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including larger, more established healthcare supply companies, thereby increasing their ability to develop and offer a broader suite of products and services to address the needs of our prospective customers;\n\u2022our competitive environment has recently experienced a significant degree of consolidation which could lead to competitors developing new business models that require us to adapt how we market, sell, or distribute our products; for example, in 2018, we initiated a company-wide organizational realignment in order to align our organizational infrastructure to centrally manage our business, including the marketing, sale, and distribution of our products, in part to address the continuing consolidation in the healthcare industry;\n\u2022other established or emerging companies may enter the markets in which we operate with products and services that are preferred by our current and potential customers based on factors such as features, capabilities, or cost;\n\u2022our competitors may develop, license, or incorporate new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services than we do;\n\u2022certain competitors have greater brand name recognition and a more extensive installed base of medication management automation solutions or other products and services than we do, and such advantages could be used to increase their market share;\n\u2022certain competitors may have existing business relationships with our current and potential customers, which may cause these customers to purchase competing products and services from these competitors; and\n\u2022our competitors may secure products and services from suppliers on more favorable terms or secure exclusive arrangements with suppliers or buyers that may impede the sales of our products and services.\nIf we fail to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nUnfavorable economic and market conditions, a decreased demand in the capital equipment market, and uncertainty regarding the rollout of government legislation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our operating results.\nCustomer demand for our products is significantly linked to the strength of the economy. If decreases in demand for capital equipment caused by weak economic conditions and decreased corporate and government spending, including any effects of fiscal budget balancing at the federal level, deferrals or delays of capital equipment projects, longer time frames for capital equipment purchasing decisions, or generally reduced expenditures for capital solutions occurs, we will experience decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, as the U.S. Federal Government implements healthcare reform legislation, and as Congress, regulatory agencies, and other state governing organizations continue to review and assess additional healthcare legislation and regulations, there may be an impact on our business. Healthcare facilities may decide to postpone or reduce spending until the implications of such healthcare enactments are more clearly understood, which may affect the demand for our products and harm our business.\nAny reduction in the demand for or adoption of our medication management automation solutions, medication packaging systems, or related services would reduce our revenues.\nOur medication management automation solutions represent only one approach to managing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and supplies at acute healthcare facilities, and our medication packaging systems represent only one way of managing medication distribution at non-acute care facilities. While a significant portion of domestic acute care facilities have adopted some level of medication and/or supply automation, a significant portion of domestic and international healthcare facilities still use traditional approaches in some form that do not include fully automated methods of medication management. As a result, we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers about the advantages of our products, which requires significant sales efforts, particularly when we are seeking to replace an incumbent supplier of medication management automation solutions and can cause longer sales cycles. Despite our significant efforts and extensive time commitments in sales to healthcare facilities, we cannot be assured that our efforts will result in sales to these customers.\nIn addition, our medication management automation solutions and our more complex automated packaging systems typically represent a sizable initial capital expenditure for healthcare organizations. Changes in the budgets of these organizations and the timing of spending under these budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our medication management automation solutions, medication packaging systems, and related services. These budgets are often supported by cash flows that can be negatively affected by declining investment income and influenced by limited resources, increased operational and financing costs, macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment rates, and conflicting spending priorities among different departments. Any decrease in expenditures by healthcare facilities or increased financing costs could decrease demand for our medication management automation solutions, medication packaging systems, and related services, and reduce our revenues.\nThe transition to selling more products which include a software as a service or solution as a service subscription presents a number of risks.\nWe currently offer our IV compounding robots, Medication Packager products, and XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System together with personnel to operate the equipment, through subscription agreements. We also offer Performance Center, Patient Engagement, and certain other products and solutions as a subscription and/or service. IVX Workflow also contains a payment stream as part of the license fees in its pricing structure. As we continue to execute on the autonomous pharmacy vision and grow subscription and cloud-based offerings, we may offer additional products and services on a subscription basis. The transition to selling more products and services on a subscription basis presents a number of risks. The shift requires an investment of technical, financial, compliance and sales resources, and we cannot guarantee that we will recoup the costs of such investments, or that these investments will improve our long-term growth and results of operations. If adoption of certain subscription products takes place faster than anticipated, the shift to subscription revenues from capital equipment sales will defer revenue recognition and we may experience a temporary reduction of revenues. If any of our subscription products do not substantially meet customer requirements, customers may cancel subscriptions, causing a decline in revenue. Customers may elect not to renew their subscriptions upon expiration, or they may attempt to renegotiate pricing or other contractual terms at or prior to renewal on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, since revenue is generally recognized over the term of the subscription, any decrease in customer purchases of our subscription-based products and services will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods, and it will also be more difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional subscription sales in any one period.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, and the costs of compliance with, and potential liability associated with, our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe receive, store, and process personal information and other data from and about customers, in addition to our employees and services providers. In addition, our customers use our solutions to obtain and store personal information, including personal health information. For example, our customers use our Omnicell Patient Engagement platform to guide and track patient notes, interventions and appointments, which involves the collection of personal health information of patients. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations by state, local, and foreign agencies, as well as contractual obligations and industry standards. Regulatory focus on data privacy and security concerns continues to increase globally, and laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information are expanding and becoming more complex. In the United States, these include federal health information privacy laws (such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"), discussed below), security breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws, as well as state laws addressing privacy and data security. For example, The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective in January 2020, imposes additional obligations on companies that process information on California residents.\nInternationally, various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have established, or are developing, their own data privacy and security legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. In certain cases, these international laws and regulations are more restrictive than many regulations in the United States. For example, within the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, imposes more stringent data protection requirements on U.S.-based companies such as ours which receive or process personal information from EU residents, and establishes greater penalties for non-compliance. Violations of the GDPR can result in penalties up to the greater of \u20ac20.0 million or 4% of global annual revenues, and may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by data controllers, customers, and data subjects. Further, Brexit (discussed in the risk factor \u201cThe United Kingdom\u2019s recent withdrawal from the European Union could adversely affect us\u201d below) has created uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. In particular, although the United Kingdom enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018 that is designed to be consistent with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated following the Brexit Transition Period (also discussed below).\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us. We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, and information security. We cannot predict the scope of any such future laws, regulations, and standards that may be applicable to us, or how courts, agencies, or data protection authorities might interpret current ones. It is possible that these laws and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the functionality of our solutions, and we cannot predict the impact of such potential, future, inconsistent interpretations.\nCompliance with privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, and other obligations is costly, and we may encounter difficulties, delays, or significant expenses in connection with our compliance, or because of our customers\u2019 need to comply or our customers\u2019 interpretation of their own legal requirements. In addition, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security could result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, exposure to indemnification obligations or other liabilities, and adverse publicity, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, as well as our business, financial condition, and results of operation. For example, as discussed further in the section entitled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, we are currently and have in the past been subject to certain class action lawsuits asserting, among other allegations, claims of violation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems, breaches of data security, or cyber-attacks on our systems or solutions, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on information technology systems to keep financial records and corporate records, communicate with staff and external parties, and operate other critical functions, including sales and manufacturing processes. In addition, we also utilize third-party cloud services in connection with our operations. Our information technology systems and third-party cloud services are potentially vulnerable to disruption due to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses, or environmental impact. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in our information technology systems or third-party cloud services, it could negatively impact the coordination of our sales, planning, and manufacturing activities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, in order to maximize our information technology efficiency, we have physically consolidated our primary corporate data and computer operations. This concentration, however, exposes us to a greater risk of disruption to our internal information technology systems. Although we maintain offsite back-ups of our data, if operations at our facilities were disrupted, it may cause a material disruption in our business if we are not capable of restoring function on an acceptable time frame.\nOur information technology systems and third-party cloud services are potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other data security breaches, whether by employees or others, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of sensitive and confidential information of our employees, customers, suppliers, and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, a security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of, or prevents access to, patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, result in litigation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues.\nIn addition, we sell certain solutions that receive, store, and process our customers\u2019 data. For example, our Performance Center solution combines a cloud-based predictive intelligence platform with expert services designed to monitor pharmacy operations and recommend opportunities to help improve efficiency, regulatory compliance and patient outcomes. In addition, our Omnicell Patient Engagement platform is a private cloud-based solution that supports improving patient adherence goals through a single web-based platform that hosts functionality to guide and track patient notes, interventions and appointments. An effective attack on our solutions could disrupt the proper functioning of our solutions, allow unauthorized access to sensitive and confidential information of our customers (including protected health information), and disrupt our customers\u2019 operations. Any of these events could cause our solutions to be perceived as having security vulnerabilities and reduce demand for our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risks are likely to increase as we continue to grow our cloud-based offerings, including in support of the autonomous pharmacy vision, and as we receive, store, and process more of our customers\u2019 data. We use third-party cloud providers in connection with certain of our cloud-based offerings or third-party providers to host our own data, in which case we rely on the processes, controls, and security such third parties have in place to protect the infrastructure. We also may acquire companies, products, services, and technologies and inherit such risks when we integrate these acquisitions within Omnicell.\nWhile we have implemented a number of security measures designed to protect our systems and data, including firewalls, antivirus and malware detection tools, patches, log monitors, routine back-ups, system audits, routine password modifications, and disaster recovery procedures, and have designed certain security features into our solutions, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events, and in some cases we may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. Any failure to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations, or implement satisfactory remedial measures, could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage, disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, damage our reputation, or expose us to a risk of financial loss, litigation, regulatory penalties, contractual indemnification obligations, or other liability because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive patient data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above.\nWe have incurred substantial debt, which could impair our flexibility and access to capital and adversely affect our financial position.\nOn November 15, 2019, we refinanced our existing senior secured credit facility pursuant to an amended and restated agreement with certain lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \u201cA&R Credit Agreement\u201d). The A&R Credit Agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $500.0 million and an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to $250.0 million. At December 31, 2019, the loan balance of the revolving credit facility was $50.0 million.\nOur debt may:\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;\n\u2022require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient funds to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or restructure all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can assure you that we would be able to do in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, as more fully described in the risk factor titled \u201cCovenants in our A&R Credit Agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our compliance with these covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected\u201d below, the A&R Credit Agreement includes customary restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that could be in our best interests.\nIn addition, borrowings under the A&R Credit Agreement bear interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of borrowings under the A&R Credit Agreement and other financial contracts that we may enter into that are indexed to LIBOR.\nWe may fail to realize the potential benefits of acquired businesses which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have in the past acquired businesses, including Aesynt and Ateb in 2016 and InPharmics in 2017, and expect to continue to seek to acquire businesses, technologies, or products in the future. We cannot provide assurance that any acquisition or any future transaction we complete will result in long-term benefits to us or our stockholders, or that we will be able to integrate or manage the acquired business effectively.\nThese transactions may involve significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit and the complexity of managing a more dispersed organization as sites are acquired;\n\u2022complying with international labor laws that may restrict our ability to right-size organizations and gain synergies across acquired operations;\n\u2022complying with regulatory requirements, such as those of the FDA, that we were not previously subject to;\n\u2022failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited previous experience;\n\u2022the substantial costs that may be incurred and the substantial diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day business when evaluating and negotiating such transactions and then integrating an acquired business, including any unforeseen delays and expenditures that may result;\n\u2022discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets acquired that are broader in scope and magnitude or are more difficult to manage than originally assumed;\n\u2022difficulties related to assimilating and retaining key personnel of an acquired business, including due to changes in compensation, changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects, office culture, or the direction of the acquired business;\n\u2022failure to achieve anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating newly acquired products and solutions in our offerings to our customers and an inability or failure to expand product bookings and sales;\n\u2022the inability to maintain business relationships with customers and suppliers of newly acquired companies due to post-acquisition disruption;\n\u2022the inability or failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts to communicate the capabilities of the combined company;\n\u2022the inability or failure to successfully integrate and harmonize financial reporting and information technology systems; and\n\u2022the inability or failure to achieve the expected operational and cost efficiencies.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate or manage the acquired businesses and their operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and our business, financial condition, and operating results may be negatively impacted.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the Aesynt, Ateb, and InPharmics acquisitions, or have recorded in connection with prior acquisitions, become impaired, we could be required to take significant charges against earnings.\nIn connection with the accounting for the Aesynt and Ateb acquisitions in 2016, and the InPharmics acquisition in 2017, we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, and we maintain significant goodwill and other intangible assets relating to prior acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of MTS, Avantec, and Mach4. As of December 31, 2019, we had recorded approximately $459.8 million net, in goodwill and intangible assets in connection with past acquisitions.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets has been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity in future periods.\nChanging customer requirements could decrease the demand for our products and services, and our new product solutions may not achieve market acceptance.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards, frequent new product introductions and dynamic customer requirements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive. These markets could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products, as well as the pricing models for such products. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services, and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing customer requirements. The process of developing products and services such as those we offer is extremely complex, and is expected to become increasingly more complex and expensive in the future as new technologies are introduced. If we are unable to enhance our existing products and services or develop new solutions to meet changing customer requirements, and bring such enhancements and solutions to market in a timely manner, demand for our products or services could decrease.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in marketing any new products or services that we introduce, that new products or services will compete effectively with similar products or services sold by our competitors, or that the level of market acceptance of such products or services will be sufficient to generate expected revenues and synergies with our other products or services. For example, our XT Series, XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System, and IVX Workflow are relatively new to the market and we cannot guarantee that demand will meet our expectations. Deployment of new products or services often requires interoperability with other Omnicell products or services as well as with healthcare facilities\u2019 existing information management systems. If these products or services fail to satisfy these demanding technological objectives, our customers may be dissatisfied, and we may be unable to generate future sales.\nThe healthcare industry faces changes to healthcare legislation and other healthcare reform, as well as financial constraints and consolidation, which could adversely affect the demand for our products and services.\nThe healthcare industry has faced, and will likely continue to face, significant financial constraints. U.S. government legislation such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the \"PPACA\"), the Budget Control Act of 2011, and other health reform legislation, or the repeal of all or a portion of any such legislation, may cause customers to postpone purchases of our products due to reductions in federal healthcare program reimbursement rates and/or needed changes to their operations in order to meet the requirements of legislation. Our automation solutions often involve a significant financial commitment from our customers and, as a result, our ability to grow our business is largely dependent on our customers\u2019 capital and operating budgets. To the extent legislation promotes spending on other initiatives or healthcare providers\u2019 spending declines or increases more slowly than we anticipate, demand for our products and services could decline.\nFor example, proposals for healthcare reform, such as \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposals that have been put forward by candidates for the 2020 presidential election, have included the concept of a \u201csingle-payer\u201d government-funded healthcare system. Such a system could reduce our customers\u2019 revenues, as Medicare and other public reimbursement rates are on average lower than commercial health plan reimbursement rates. While it is not likely that legislation creating such a single-payer system will pass Congress and be signed by the President in the near term, continued introduction of legislation promoting a single-payer system by several members of Congress and presidential candidates could increase uncertainty for our customers and cause them to delay purchases of our products and services.\nIn addition, healthcare providers have consolidated to create larger healthcare delivery organizations in order to achieve economies of scale and/or greater market power. If this consolidation continues, it would increase the size of certain target customers, which could increase the cost, effort, and difficulty in selling our products to such target customers, or could cause our existing customers or potential new customers to begin utilizing our competitors\u2019 products if such customers are acquired by healthcare providers that prefer our competitors\u2019 products to ours. In addition, the resulting organizations could have greater bargaining power, which may lead to price erosion.\nGovernment regulation of the healthcare industry could reduce demand for our products, or substantially increase the cost to produce our products.\nThe manufacture and sale of most of our current products are not regulated by the FDA, or the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d). Through our acquisition of Aesynt, we have both Class I and Class II, 510(k) exempt medical devices which are subject to FDA regulation and require compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulation as well as medical\ndevice reporting. Additional products may be regulated in the future by the FDA, DEA, or other federal agencies due to future legislative and regulatory initiatives or reforms. Direct regulation of our business and products by the FDA, DEA, or other federal agencies could substantially increase the cost to produce our products and increase the time required to bring those products to market, reduce the demand for our products, and reduce our revenues. In addition, healthcare providers and facilities that use our equipment and dispense controlled substances are subject to regulation by the DEA. The failure of these providers and facilities to comply with DEA requirements, including the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, could reduce demand for our products and harm our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition. Pharmacies are regulated by individual state boards of pharmacy that issue rules for pharmacy licensure in their respective jurisdictions. State boards of pharmacy do not license or approve our medication management automation solutions; however, pharmacies using our equipment are subject to state board approval. The failure of such pharmacies to meet differing requirements from a significant number of state boards of pharmacy could decrease demand for our products and harm our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition. Similarly, hospitals must be accredited by an accrediting organization approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, such as The Joint Commission, in order to be eligible for Medicaid and Medicare funds. The Joint Commission does not accredit medication management automation solutions; however, failure by our customers to meet The Joint Commission standards for medication management could decrease demand for our products and harm our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWhile we have implemented a Privacy and Use of Information Policy and adhere to established privacy principles, use of customer information guidelines, and related federal and state statutes, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all federal and state healthcare information privacy and security laws that we are directly or indirectly subject to, including, without limitation, HIPAA. Among other things, this legislation required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt national standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health information transactions and protecting the privacy and security of personally identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by \u201ccovered entities,\u201d which include pharmacies and other healthcare providers with which we do business.\nThe standards adopted to date include, among others, the \u201cStandards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information,\u201d which restrict the use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information by covered entities, and the \u201cSecurity Standards,\u201d which require covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the integrity and security of certain electronic health information. Under HIPAA, we are considered a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d in relation to many of our customers that are covered entities, and as such, most of these customers have required that we enter into written agreements governing the way we handle and safeguard certain patient health information we may encounter in providing our products and services, and may impose liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations. Further, pursuant to changes in HIPAA under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, we are covered under HIPAA similar to other covered entities and in some cases, subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as a covered entity. A number of states have also enacted privacy and security statutes and regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than HIPAA and may also apply directly to us. If our past or present operations are found to violate any of these laws, we may be subject to fines, penalties, and other sanctions.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the potential impact of future HIPAA standards and other federal and state privacy and security laws that may be enacted at any time on our customers or on Omnicell. These laws could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use, or disseminate patient information, which could reduce the demand for our products or force us to redesign our products in order to meet regulatory requirements.\nOur software products are complex and may contain defects, which could harm our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe market products that contain software and products that are software only. Although we perform extensive testing prior to releasing software products, these products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first released. These may not be discovered until the product has been used by customers in different application environments. Failure to discover product deficiencies or bugs could require design modifications to previously shipped products or cause delays in the installation of our products and unfavorable publicity or negatively impact system shipments, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhen we experience delays in installations of our medication management automation solutions or our more complex medication packaging systems, resulting in delays in our ability to recognize revenue, our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe purchase of our medication management automation solutions or our more complex medication packaging systems is often part of a customer\u2019s larger initiative to re-engineer its pharmacy and their distribution and materials management systems. As a result, our sales cycles are often lengthy. The purchase of our systems often entails larger strategic purchases by customers that frequently require more complex and stringent contractual requirements and generally involve a\nsignificant commitment of management attention and resources by prospective customers. These larger and more complex transactions often require the input and approval of many decision-makers, including pharmacy directors, materials managers, nurse managers, financial managers, information systems managers, administrators, lawyers, and boards of directors. In addition, new product announcements, such as that of our XT Series, can cause a delay in our customers\u2019 decision to purchase our products or convert orders from our older products to those of our newer products, such as the XT Series. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with sales of our medication management automation solutions and our more complex medication packaging systems is often lengthy and subject to a number of delays over which we have little or no control. A delay in, or loss of, sales of these systems could have an adverse effect upon our operating results and could harm our business.\nIn addition, and in part as a result of the complexities inherent in larger transactions, the time between the purchase and installation of our systems can generally range from two weeks to one year. Delays in installation can occur for reasons that are often outside of our control. We have also experienced fluctuations in our customer and transaction size mix, which makes our ability to forecast our product bookings more difficult. Because we recognize revenues for our medication management automation solutions and our more complex medication packaging systems only upon installation at a customer\u2019s site, any delay in installation by our customers will also cause a delay in the recognition of the revenues for that system.\nOur international operations may subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.\nWe currently have operations outside of the United States, including sales efforts centered in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific regions, and supply chain efforts in Asia. We intend to continue to expand our international operations, particularly in certain markets that we view as strategic, including the Middle East. Our international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022our reliance on distributors for the sale and post-sale support of our medication management automation solutions outside the United States and Canada;\n\u2022the difficulty of managing an organization operating in various countries;\n\u2022political sentiment against international outsourcing of production;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights, particularly in jurisdictions that have less developed intellectual property regimes, which could make it more costly for us to enforce, and more difficult for us to stop the infringement or misappropriation of, our intellectual property rights in these jurisdictions;\n\u2022changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the requirement to comply with a variety of international laws and regulations, including privacy and security, labor, import, export, trade, environmental standards, product compliance, tax, anti-bribery, and employment laws;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates and difficulties in repatriating funds from certain countries;\n\u2022additional investment, coordination, and lead-time necessary to successfully interface our automation solutions with the existing information systems of our customers or potential customers outside of the United States; and\n\u2022political unrest, terrorism, and the potential for other hostilities in areas in which we have facilities or operations; and\n\u2022natural disasters.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and address these risks properly, our business or operating results will be harmed.\nFurthermore, we face risks related to outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health epidemics, which could cause us or our suppliers and/or customers to temporarily suspend operations in the affected city or country. For example, following the outbreak of the coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the Chinese government has taken certain emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including implementation of travel bans and closure of factories and businesses. We import certain critical components from suppliers located in China. While we are closely monitoring developments in China and evaluating mitigation strategies, the full impact of this outbreak is uncertain at this time and any prolonged disruption to our China-based suppliers could significantly disrupt our supply chain and negatively impact our sales and operating results.\nIn addition, changes in export or import regulation and other trade barriers and uncertainties may have an adverse effect on our business. For example, the current U.S. administration has advocated greater restrictions on trade generally and tariff increases on certain goods imported into the United States, particularly from China. We cannot predict what actions may\nultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries (including China), what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies, or the related uncertainties, has the potential to adversely impact our supply chain and costs, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nIn the past, we have experienced substantial fluctuations in customer demand, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to respond proactively to future changes in customer demand.\nOur ability to adjust to fluctuations in our revenues while still achieving or sustaining profitability is dependent upon our ability to manage costs and control expenses. If our revenues increase or decrease rapidly, we may not be able to manage these changes effectively. Future growth is dependent on the continued demand for our products and services, the volume of installations we are able to complete, our ability to continue to meet our customers\u2019 needs and provide a quality installation experience, and our flexibility in manpower allocations among customers to complete installations on a timely basis.\nOur ability to control expenses is dependent on our ability to continue to develop and leverage effective and efficient human and information technology systems, our ability to gain efficiencies in our workforce through the local and worldwide labor markets, and our ability to grow our outsourced vendor supply model. Our expense growth rate may equal or exceed our revenue growth rate if we are unable to streamline our operations, incur significant research and development expenses prior to, or without recognizing the benefits, of those solutions under development, incur acquisition-related integration expenses greater than those we anticipate, or fail to reduce the costs or increase the margins of our products. In addition, we may not be able to reduce our expenses to keep pace with any reduction in our revenue, which could harm our results of operations and financial position.\nCovenants in our A&R Credit Agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways, and if we do not effectively manage our compliance with these covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe A&R Credit Agreement contains various customary covenants that limit our ability and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations or other persons;\n\u2022issue redeemable preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022make loans, investments, acquisitions, and capital expenditures;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nThe A&R Credit Agreement also includes financial covenants requiring us (i) not to exceed a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.50:1 (subject to certain exceptions) and (ii) to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00:1. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants under the A&R Credit Agreement could result in a default under the terms of the A&R Credit Agreement, which could permit the administrative agent or the lenders to declare all or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable, or to refuse to permit additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions to take advantage of certain business opportunities that may be presented to us. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, the administrative agent and the lenders under the A&R Credit Agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, which would seriously harm our business.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel, our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the continuing contributions of our key management, sales, technical, and engineering staff. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to attract, train, and retain highly skilled and\nmotivated personnel. As more of our products are installed in increasingly complex environments, greater technical expertise will be required. As our installed base of customers increases, we will also face additional demands on our customer service and support personnel, requiring additional resources to meet these demands. Furthermore, as we execute on the autonomous pharmacy vision and grow our cloud-based software as a service and solution as a service offerings, more specialized expertise will be required. We may experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel. Competition for qualified technical, engineering, managerial, sales, marketing, financial reporting, and other personnel can be intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Competitors have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to recruit our employees.\nIn addition, we have historically used stock options, restricted stock units, and other forms of equity compensation as key components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees\u2019 interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention, and provide competitive compensation packages. The effect of managing share-based compensation expense and minimizing shareholder dilution from the issuance of new shares may make it less favorable for us to grant stock options, restricted stock units, or other forms of equity compensation, to employees in the future. In order to continue granting equity compensation at competitive levels, we must seek stockholder approval for any increases to the number of shares reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans, such as the share increase that was approved at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and we cannot assure you that we will receive such approvals in the future. Any failure to receive approval for future proposed increases could prevent us from granting equity compensation at competitive levels and make it more difficult to attract, retain, and motivate employees. Further, to the extent that we expand our business or product lines through the acquisition of other businesses, any failure to receive any such approvals could prevent us from securing employment commitments from such newly acquired employees. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could harm our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could negatively affect our ability to compete.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for technology and processes, and our ability to preserve our trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. We have pursued patent protection in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary and for technology that offers us a potential competitive advantage for our products. We intend to continue to pursue such protection in the future. Our issued patents relate to various features of our medication management automation solutions and medication packaging systems. We cannot assure you that we will file any patent applications in the future and that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents, or that, if issued, such patents will provide significant protection for our technology and processes. As an example, in September 2014, an action was brought against us, to, among other matters, correct the inventorship of certain patents owned by us. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or that others will not design around the patents we own. All of our system software is copyrighted and subject to the protection of applicable copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, which could harm our competitive position.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary in the future depending on many factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022our ability to successfully install our products on a timely basis and meet other contractual obligations necessary to recognize revenue;\n\u2022our ability to continue cost reduction efforts;\n\u2022the size, product mix, and timing of orders for our medication management automation solutions and medication packaging systems, and their installation and integration;\n\u2022the overall demand for healthcare medication management automation solutions and medication adherence solutions;\n\u2022changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022the number, timing, and significance of product enhancements and new product announcements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022the timing and significance of any acquisition or business development transactions that we may consider or negotiate and the revenues, costs, and earnings that may be associated with these transactions;\n\u2022the relative proportions of revenues we derive from products and services;\n\u2022fluctuations in the percentage of sales attributable to our international business;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 budget cycles;\n\u2022changes in our operating expenses and our ability to stabilize expenses;\n\u2022expenses incurred to remediate product quality, security, or safety issues;\n\u2022our ability to generate cash from our accounts receivable on a timely basis;\n\u2022the performance of our products;\n\u2022changes in our business strategy;\n\u2022macroeconomic and political conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates, tax increases, availability of credit markets, and trade and tariff actions; and\n\u2022volatility in our stock price and its effect on equity-based compensation expense.\nDue to all of these factors, our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, which in turn may cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with group purchasing organizations or other similar organizations, we may have difficulty selling our products and services to customers represented by these organizations.\nA number of GPOs, including HealthTrust Purchasing Group, Intalere (f.k.a. Amerinet, Inc.), Premier Inc., The Resource Group, Resource Optimization & Innovation, LLC, and Vizient Inc., have negotiated standard contracts for our products on behalf of their member healthcare organizations. Members of these GPOs may purchase under the terms of these contracts, which obligate us to pay the GPO a fee. We have also contracted with the United States General Services Administration, allowing the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Department of Defense, and other Federal Government customers to purchase our products. These contracts enable us to more readily sell our products and services to customers represented by these organizations. Some of our contracts with these organizations are terminable at the convenience of either party. The loss of any of these relationships could impact the breadth of our customer base and could impair our ability to meet our revenue targets or increase our revenues. These organizations may not renew our contracts on similar terms, if at all, and they may choose to terminate our contracts before they expire, any of which could cause our revenues to decline.\nIf we are not able to supply the demand from our institutional and retail pharmacy customers on schedule and with quality consumable medication packaging products, or if we are otherwise unable to maintain our relationships with major institutional pharmacies, they may use alternative means to distribute medications to their customers and our revenue from sales of blister cards and other consumables may decline.\nApproximately 10% of our revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 were generated from the sale of consumable medication packages, most of which are produced in our St. Petersburg, Florida facility on a continuous basis and are shipped out to fulfill the demands of our institutional and retail pharmacy customers domestically and abroad. The demands placed on institutional and retail pharmacies by their customers represent real time requirements of those customers. Our customer agreements for the sale of consumable medication packages are typically short-term in nature and typically do not include any volume commitments on the part of the customer. Although our packaging may be considered the preferred method of maintaining control of medications during the medication distribution and administration process, institutional and retail pharmacies have alternative methods of distributing medications, including bulk and alternative packaging, and medication adherence packaging may be supplied by our competitors. To the extent that we are unable to supply quality packaging to our customers in a timely manner, that demand will be met via alternative distribution methods, including consumable medication packaging sold by our competitors, and our revenues will decline. Any disruption in the production capabilities of our St. Petersburg facilities will adversely affect our ability to ship our consumable medication packages globally and would reduce our revenues.\nIn addition, the institutional pharmacy market consists of significant national suppliers of medications to non-acute care facilities, smaller regional suppliers, and very small local suppliers. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with the major institutional pharmacies we do business with, they may purchase consumable blister card components from alternative sources, or choose to use alternatives to blister cards for medication control, and our revenues would decline.\nIf we are unable to successfully interface our automation solutions with the existing information systems of our customers, they may choose not to use our products and services.\nFor healthcare facilities to fully benefit from our automation solutions, our systems must interface with certain of their other information systems. This may require substantial cooperation, incremental investment, and coordination on the part of our customers, and may require coordination with third-party suppliers of the existing information systems. There is little uniformity in the systems currently used by our customers, which complicates the interfacing process. If these systems are not successfully interfaced, our customers could choose not to use or to reduce their use of our automation solutions, which would harm our business. Also, these information systems are impacted by regulatory forces, such as the Promoting Interoperability Program and HIPAA Omnibus Rules, and may evolve their interoperability functionality accordingly. We expect to comply with the mandatory standards and certifications that enable us to continuously interoperate with partner information systems, but such symbiotic evolution in a changing regulatory environment can at times create an execution risk.\nAdditionally, our competitors may enter into agreements with providers of hospital information systems that are designed to increase the interoperability of their respective products. To the extent our competitors are able to increase the interoperability of their products with those of the major hospital information systems providers, customers who utilize such information systems may choose not to use our products and services. In addition, hospital and physician office information systems providers may choose to develop their own solutions that could compete with ours. Furthermore, we expect the importance of interoperability to continue to increase in the next few years. Regulations such as the Quality Payment Program are expected to heavily focus on evidence and outcomes. Given our role in care delivery process, the data generated by our products may be a key input for assessing and reporting on clinical outcomes. This may elevate interoperability with information systems to a relative importance to our customers creating a business opportunity and risk.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for our products, and our business may suffer if we were required to change suppliers to obtain an adequate supply of components, equipment, and raw materials on a timely basis.\nAlthough we generally use parts and components for our products with a high degree of modularity, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that are necessary in the production of our consumable medication packages. While we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of all components and raw materials in a timely manner from existing sources, or where necessary, from alternative sources of supply, we entered into relationships with new suppliers in connection with the launch of our XT Series products. We engage multiple single source third-party manufacturers to build several of our sub-assemblies. The risks associated with changing to alternative vendors, if necessary, for any of the numerous components used to manufacture our products could limit our ability to manufacture our products and harm our business. Due to our reliance on a few single source partners to build our hardware sub-assemblies and on a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that are necessary in the production of our consumable medication packages, a reduction or interruption in supply from our partners or suppliers, or a significant increase in the price of one or more components could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In certain circumstances, the failure of any of our suppliers or us to perform adequately could result in quality control issues affecting end users\u2019 acceptance of our products. These impacts could damage customer relationships and could harm our business.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could cause our stock price to decline.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to the effectiveness of internal control. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting.\nIf the market price of our common stock continues to be highly volatile, the investment value of our common stock may decline.\nOur common stock traded between $57.81 and $92.59 per share during the year ended December 31, 2019. The market price for shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. In addition, our announcements or external events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. These announcements or external events may include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our operating results;\n\u2022whether our operating results or forecasts meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022developments in our relationships with corporate customers;\n\u2022developments with respect to recently acquired businesses;\n\u2022changes in the ratings of our common stock by securities analysts or changes in their earnings estimates;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new products;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies; or other significant transactions by us or our competitors such as strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022actions by stockholders or short sellers of our common stock;\n\u2022the level of demand for our common stock, including short interest in our common stock; or\n\u2022general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock market as a whole from time to time has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for technology companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline irrespective of our performance. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could lower the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. For example, as described in the section entitled \"Legal Proceedings\" in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, in July 2019, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against Omnicell and certain of our officers alleging that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making certain materially false and misleading statements. While this action is concluded following the lead plaintiff's filing of a notice of voluntary dismissal as to all defendants, we may in the future be subject to other class action lawsuits, especially following periods of volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s recent withdrawal from the European Union could adversely affect us.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) left the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) on January 31, 2020. The UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU is commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK is subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020 (the \u201cBrexit Transition Period\u201d), during which EU rules will continue to apply. Negotiations between the UK and the EU are expected to continue in relation to the customs and trading relationship between the UK and the EU following the expiry of the Brexit Transition Period. The effects of Brexit have been and are expected to continue to be far-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in Europe and globally, and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial markets as well as uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the UK. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the UK and the EU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. The full effects of Brexit are uncertain and will remain so until after the Brexit Transition Period and the UK and EU reach a definitive resolution with regards to outstanding trade and legal matters. Lastly, as a result of Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the EU. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by Brexit is uncertain.\nOur U.S. government lease agreements are subject to annual budget funding cycles and mandated unilateral changes, which may affect our ability to enter into such leases or to recognize revenues, and sell receivables based on these leases.\nU.S. government customers that lease our equipment typically sign contracts with five-year payment terms that are subject to one-year government budget funding cycles. Further, the government has in certain circumstances mandated unilateral changes in its Federal Supply Services contract that could render our lease terms with the government less attractive. In our judgment and based on our history with these accounts, we believe these receivables are collectible. However, in the future, the failure of any of our U.S. government customers to receive their annual funding, or the government mandating changes to the Federal Supply Services contract could impair our ability to sell lease equipment to these customers or to sell our U.S. government receivables to third-party leasing companies. In addition, the ability to collect payments on unsold receivables could be impaired and may result in a write-down of our unsold receivables from U.S. government customers. The balance of our unsold leases to U.S. government customers was $17.2 million as of December 31, 2019.\nIf we fail to manage our inventory properly, our revenue, gross margin, and profitability could suffer.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is a complex task. A number of factors, including, but not limited to, the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain components that are in short supply or that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing, the general unpredictability of demand for specific products and customer requests for quick delivery schedules, may result in us maintaining large amounts of inventory. Other factors, including changes in market demand, customer requirements, and technology, may cause our inventory to become obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could result in inventory write-downs, which in turn could harm our business and results of operations.\nIntellectual property claims against us could harm our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe expect that developers of medication management automation solutions and medication packaging systems will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. In the future, third parties may claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights with respect to current or future products. We do not carry special insurance that covers intellectual property infringement claims; however, such claims may be covered under our traditional insurance policies. These policies contain terms, conditions, and exclusions that make recovery for intellectual property infringement claims difficult to guarantee. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could harm our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition.\nProduct liability claims against us could harm our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur products include medication management automation solutions and medication adherence products and services for healthcare systems and pharmacies. Despite the presence of healthcare and pharmacy professionals as intermediaries between our products and patients, if our products fail to provide accurate and timely information or operate as designed, customers, patients or their family members could assert claims against us for product liability. For example, as further discussed under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, we are currently subject to certain lawsuits, asserting, among other allegations, claims of product liability. Moreover, failure of health care facility and pharmacy employees to use our products for their intended purposes could result in product liability claims against us. Litigation with respect to product liability claims, regardless of any outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management\u2019s attention from operations, and decrease market acceptance of our products. We possess a variety of insurance policies that include coverage for general commercial liability and technology errors and omissions liability. We attempt to mitigate these risks through contractual terms negotiated with our customers. However, these policies and protective contractual terms may not be adequate against product liability claims. A successful claim brought against us, or any claim or product recall that results in negative publicity about us, could harm our competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition. Also, in the event that any of our products is defective, we may be required to recall or redesign those products.\nWe are dependent on technologies provided by third-party vendors, the loss of which could negatively and materially affect our ability to market, sell, or distribute our products.\nSome of our products incorporate technologies owned by third parties that are licensed to us for use, modification, and distribution. For example, the VBM 200F is manufactured by a third party and sold by us pursuant to a distribution and supplier agreement. In addition, we recently entered into a reseller agreement with Kit Check, Inc. to offer BlueSight for Controlled Substances diversion prevention software to our customers. If we lose access to third-party technologies, such as our ability to distribute the VBM 200F or BlueSight for Controlled Substances, or we lose the ongoing rights to modify and distribute these technologies with our products, we will have to devote resources to independently develop, maintain and support the technologies ourselves, pay increased license costs, or transition to another vendor. Any independent development, maintenance or support of these technologies by us or the transition to alternative technologies could be costly, time consuming, and could delay our product releases and upgrade schedules. These factors could negatively and materially affect our ability to market, sell or distribute our products.\nComplications in connection with our ongoing business information system upgrades, including those required to transition acquired entities onto information systems already utilized, and those implemented to adopt new accounting standards, may impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe continue to upgrade our enterprise-level business information system with new capabilities and transition acquired entities onto information systems already utilized in the company. For example, we are currently in the process of replacing the legacy Enterprise Requirements Planning systems used at Aesynt with systems currently in use in other parts of Omnicell, and we intend to do the same at Ateb. Based upon the complexity of some of the upgrades, there is risk that we will not see the\nexpected benefit from the implementation of these upgrades in accordance with their anticipated timeline and will incur costs in addition to those we have already planned for. In addition, in future years, we will need to comply with new accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) for components of our financial reporting. These new standards will require us to modify our accounting policies and financial reporting disclosure. We further anticipate that integration of these and possibly other new standards may require a substantial amount of management\u2019s time and attention, and require integration with our enterprise resource planning system. The implementation of the system and the adoption of future new standards, in isolation as well as together, could result in operating inefficiencies and financial reporting delays, and could impact our ability to timely record certain business transactions. All of these potential results could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOutstanding employee stock options have the potential to dilute stockholder value and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe grant stock options to certain of our employees as incentives to join Omnicell or as an on-going reward and retention vehicle. We had options outstanding to purchase approximately 3.9 million shares of our common stock, at a weighted-average exercise price of $52.75 per share as of December 31, 2019. If some or all of these shares are sold into the public market over a short time period, the price of our common stock may decline, as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at the prevailing market prices. Such sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future on terms that we deem acceptable.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may seek additional capital through a variety of means, including through private and public equity offerings and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, entering into licensing arrangements, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds from third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFor example, we filed a \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act in November 2017 (the \u201cS-3 Registration Statement\u201d), allowing us, from time to time, to offer any combination of registered common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants. Under this S-3 Registration Statement, we also entered into a distribution agreement (the \u201cDistribution Agreement\u201d) in November 2017 with J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as our sales agents, pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time through \u201cat-the-market\u201d offerings, up to an aggregate of $125.0 million of our common stock through the sales agents. As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $31.5 million available to be offered under the Distribution Agreement.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, our ability to market, sell or distribute our products may be negatively impacted and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in our tax rates, exposure to additional tax liabilities, or the adoption of new tax legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: changes in the mix of earnings with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in federal, state, and international laws or their interpretation, adjustments to income tax expense upon the finalization of tax returns, changes in tax attribute, or changes in accounting principles. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We are also subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be a material difference between the forecasted and the accrual tax rates. Any increase in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure, data centers, enterprise applications, and technology systems for the development, marketing, support, and sales of our products, and for the internal operation of our business. These systems are susceptible to disruption or failure in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, ice and snow storms, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic event. Many of these systems are housed or supported in or around our corporate headquarters located in Northern California, near major earthquake faults, and where a significant portion of our\nresearch and development activities and other critical business operations take place. Other critical systems, including our manufacturing facilities for our consumable medication packages, are housed in St. Petersburg, Florida, in communities that have been subject to significant tropical storms. Disruptions to or the failure of any of these systems, and the resulting loss of critical data, which is not quickly recoverable by the effective execution of disaster recovery plans designed to reduce such disruption, could cause delays in our product development, prevent us from fulfilling our customers\u2019 orders, and could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, the result of which would adversely affect our operating results.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law, and any stockholders\u2019 rights plan we may adopt in the future, make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders. Our anti-takeover provisions include provisions in our certificate of incorporation providing that stockholders\u2019 meetings may only be called by our Board of Directors and provisions in our bylaws providing that the stockholders may not take action by written consent and requiring that stockholders that desire to nominate any person for election to our Board of Directors or to make any proposal with respect to business to be conducted at a meeting of our stockholders be submitted in appropriate form to our Secretary within a specified period of time in advance of any such meeting. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, our Board of Directors approves the transaction. Our Board of Directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our Board of Directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nThe stockholder rights plan adopted by our Board of Directors in February 2003 expired by its terms in February 2013. Our Board of Directors could adopt a similar plan in the future if it determines that such action is in the best interests of our stockholders. Such a plan may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89110, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "OMCL"}
