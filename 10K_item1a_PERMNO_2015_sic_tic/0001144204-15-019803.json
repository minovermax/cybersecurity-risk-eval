{"cik": "1307752", "company": "VirtualScopics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nIf our services do not continue to attract interest from new and existing customers, we may not maintain our current level of business or achieve future growth.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract interest in the industry for our services, we could fail to maintain our current level of business or achieve future growth. This would have a detrimental effect on our business. Our ability to generate revenues is highly dependent on building and maintaining relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. No assurance can be given that a sufficient number of such companies will maintain or increase their demand for our services, thereby limiting the overall market and not enable us to increase our revenue. In addition, the rate of the growth of MRI and CT image-based biomarkers is difficult to predict. Failure to attract and maintain a significant customer base would have a detrimental effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe majority of the contracts we have with customers are cancelable for any reason by giving 30 days advance notice.\nOur customers typically engage us to perform services for them on a project-by-project basis and are required by us to enter into a written contractual agreement for the work, labor and services to be performed. Generally, our project contracts are terminable by the customer for any or no reason on 30 days\u2019 advance notice to us. If a number of our customers were to exercise cancellation rights, our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur reported amounts of anticipated service revenue to be earned from the backlog may not be indicative of future results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the amount of anticipated service revenue remaining to be earned from the backlog was approximately $29 million as compared to approximately $24 million as of December 31, 2013.\nBacklog represents anticipated service revenue from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts. The majority of contracts we have with customers are cancelable for any reason by giving 30 days advance notice. We cannot assure you that this amount will be indicative of future results. Furthermore, the contracts may contemplate performance over multiple years. Therefore, revenue may not be realized in the fiscal year in which the contract is signed or the award is made. There are several factors that can affect whether we will realize the full benefits under a contract or award and the time over which we will realize that revenue including:\n\u2022 Customer cancellation due to performance reasons with their compounds in development;\n\u2022 Change in the scope of a project;\n\u2022 Timing of performance, including over multiple years;\n\u2022 Timing of patient recruitment and image site identification and training.\nAlso, if clients delay projects, we will not generate revenue at the rate originally expected. Accordingly, the historical relationship of our reported backlog to revenues may not be indicative of future results.\nIf we are unable to manage and sustain growth in our business, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe have seen a growing demand for our image analysis services in clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies over the past year. Although there can be no assurance that growth in demand will continue or that customers will complete the clinical trial projects as awarded to us, if it does continue we may be unable to scale our capacity efficiently to meet this demand. If we are unable to do so, we may fail to maintain our operating margins or achieve expected operating margins. This may have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur services may become obsolete if we do not effectively respond to rapid technological change on a timely basis.\nOur services depend on the needs of our customers and their desire to utilize image-related services in drug and medical device development. Since the image-based biomarker industry is characterized by evolving technologies, uncertain technology and limited availability of standards, we must respond to new research findings and technological changes affecting our customers. We may not be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new or modified products and services, which respond to technological changes, evolving customer requirements and competition. If we are unsuccessful in this regard, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a history of operating losses and uncertain future profitability.\nWe have incurred losses from operating activities. As we work to grow our business, we may face risks and difficulties in our business including uncertainties of maintaining our current customers, further market penetration, competition, cost increases and delays in achieving business objectives. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in addressing any or all of these risks or that we will achieve future profitability. The failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAlthough we believe that our services do not and will not infringe upon the patents or violate the proprietary rights of others, it is possible such infringement or violation has occurred or may occur which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPortions of our business are reliant upon patented and patentable systems and methods used in our image analysis and related intellectual property. In the event that we are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others, we could be required to modify our products and services or obtain a license for the manufacture and/or sale of such services. In such event, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all, and the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action. In addition, we could be subject to injunctive relief and, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to pharmaceutical, medical device and healthcare industry regulations, which could adversely affect the nature and extent of the products and services we offer.\nMany aspects of the pharmaceutical, medical device and healthcare industry are subject to regulation at the federal level. From time to time, the regulatory entities that have jurisdiction over the industry adopt new or modified regulations or take other actions as a result of their own regulatory processes or as directed by other governmental bodies. This changing regulatory environment could adversely affect the nature and extent of the services we are able to offer.\nOur failure to compete effectively in our industry could cause our revenues to decline.\nThe image analysis industry is highly competitive. We face numerous competitors in our business. If we fail to compete effectively, we will lose clients, which would cause our business to suffer. Our ability to successfully compete is dependent on many factors, including: timely and quality performance; expertise and experience in specific therapeutic areas; the scope of service offerings; strength in various geographic markets; the price of services; our competitors\u2019 service and product offerings; and our ability to upgrade our services in comparison to the service and product offerings of our competitors. If our services are not competitive based on these or other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nWe may in the future experience competition from academic sites, imaging CROs, and other competing technologies.\nCompetition in the development of imaging solutions may become more widespread as with emerging technologies such as proteomics and genomics which can serve as predictive tools of drug efficacy. Competitors range from university-based research and development projects which would develop advanced tools to development stage companies and major domestic and international companies which would commercialize the tools. Some of these entities have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources than ours. There can be no assurance that we can continue to develop our technologies or that present or future competitors will not develop technologies that render our image-based biomarker industry obsolete or less marketable or that we will be able to introduce new products and product enhancements that are competitive with other products marketed by industry participants.\nWe have experienced significant demand from certain customers, thereby increasing our dependence on these customers until we can further diversify our customer base.\nWhile we continue to serve a broad range of customers, we have experienced strong demand from four of our customers in 2014 as compared to three of our customers in 2013. We depend on these customers to sustain our growth. In 2014 and 2013, these customers accounted for 77% and 65% of our revenue, respectively. We continue to see demand from other customers but not at the same significant pace as these three customers. We continue to invest on our sales and marketing efforts to further diversify our customers and more broadly penetrate the market, in order to minimize reliance on any one customer. As with all of our contracts, these customers may terminate their contractual relationships with us for any or no reason on 30 days\u2019 advance notice. A decision by any of these customers to cancel all of its studies with us could have an adverse impact on the growth of our business.\nConsolidation within the pharmaceutical industry and changes within healthcare regulation may have an adverse impact on our business.\nOver the past few years, there have been several mergers and acquisitions among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Historically, these transactions have positively impacted our business due to the ability to use our strong relationships within one of the merged entities to better penetrate the combined entity. However, there can be no assurance that consolidation within the industry will continue to be beneficial to us. Additionally, with the recent political landscape and changes within the healthcare industry, there may be an adverse impact on our business if the cost of imaging significantly increases or no longer becomes standard of care for patients. Although, we do not believe imaging will decline in its level of use, if it does we may need to reduce prices or invest in research to advance the education and science of medical imaging.\nConsolidation among our competitors could cause us to lose customers or could exert additional pressure on the prices of our services.\nThere has been a significant amount of consolidation among providers of clinical trial imaging services and other services such as ours. Larger enterprises created through this consolidation may also have greater resources and efficiencies than our company and have other competitive advantages. As a result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased. Further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nLoss of key personnel, or failure to attract and retain additional personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. The Board of Directors appointed director Eric Converse to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Groff to serve as Chief Financial Officer during 2014. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business or further turnover in our workforce or management team. The loss of services of one or more other members of senior management would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, our performance also depends on our ability to attract and retain management and qualified scientific and technical operating staff. Competition for these skilled personnel is intense. The loss of services of any key executive, or inability to continue to attract and retain qualified staff could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not maintain any key employee insurance on any of our executives.\nThe trading price of our stock may be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain and grow our business.\nWe intend to continue to use our cash on hand to broaden our market penetration of our services within the industry. If our plans or assumptions with respect to our business change or prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to use part or all of our cash to fund general operating expenses and/or reduce costs within the organization.\nWe currently do not plan to raise additional capital. However, if we need to raise additional capital, it may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain required capital, or the acquisition of capital on less favorable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business. If we issue additional equity securities in the future, there could be a dilution or a reduction in priority of our outstanding securities.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; developments concerning intellectual property rights and regulatory approvals; quarterly variations in our competitors\u2019 results of operations; changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; developments in our industry; product liability claims or other litigation; and general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our own operating performance.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and may be difficult to sell.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market or exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is currently below $5.00 per share and therefore may be designated as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares.\nOur strategic alliance with PPD is an important aspect of our growth, and the market may not value our strategic alliance with PPD as we anticipate.\nIn 2010, we formed an alliance with PPD to provide a joint solution to provide clients with an integrated and customized clinical development and medical imaging solution for oncology clinical trials. The alliance was expanded in January 2012 to include cardiovascular, central nervous system and medical device studies. If the market does not value this model as we anticipate, our ability to grow our business may be negatively impacted. Additionally, the agreement may be terminated by either party on 90 days\u2019 notice. In the event PPD terminates the agreement, we may also experience a negative impact in our ability to experience the level of growth we have historically achieved.\nThe inability to maintain our NASDAQ listing may adversely affect the trading market for our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements, including the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. If our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, trading in our common stock could be conducted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the over-the-counter market in what is commonly referred to as the \"pink sheets.\" If this occurs, a shareholder will find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of our common stock. Lack of any active trading market would have an adverse effect on a shareholder's ability to liquidate an investment in our common stock easily and quickly at a price acceptable to the shareholder. It might also contribute to volatility in the market price of our common stock and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nA significant number of the shares of our common stock are eligible for sale, and their sale could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the possibility of such sales could harm the market price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities. As of December 31, 2014, we had 2,994,928 shares of common stock outstanding. These shares are eligible for resale in the public market either immediately or subject to applicable limitations of Rule 144. In addition to these outstanding shares of common stock, we also have shares to be issued upon the conversion or exercise of 404,612 outstanding options to purchase common stock, 136,132 warrants to purchase common stock and 478,701 shares of preferred stock that are convertible into common stock. We have registered on Form S-8 the sale of up to 690,000 shares issued or to be issued pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, of which 363,070 are subject to outstanding option awards. Sales of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market for the shares of our common stock.\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of other stockholders.\nOur officers, directors, principal stockholders (greater than 5%) and their affiliates control approximately 30% of our outstanding voting securities. If these stockholders act together, they will be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs requiring stockholder approval, including approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all our stockholders.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and the lack of dividends may have a negative effect on the stock price.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and meet dividend obligations on our series C-1 and series B convertible preferred stock. In addition, the terms of our series C-1 and series B preferred stock limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 91286, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "VSCP"}
