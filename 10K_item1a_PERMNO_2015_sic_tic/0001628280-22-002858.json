{"cik": "917491", "company": "FARO TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe statements under this heading describe the most significant risks to our business identified by management and should be considered carefully in conjunction with the discussion in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in, or retain, shares of our common stock.\nAny of the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. These are not the only risks we face. Our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known by us or by factors that we currently do not consider to be material to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nCompetitors may develop products that make our products obsolete or less competitive.\nThe 3D measurement and imaging solutions market is characterized by rapid technological change. Competitors may develop new or improved products, processes or technologies that may make our products obsolete or less competitive.\nAs a result, our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our technological advantage by developing new products and applications and enhancing our existing products, which can be complex and time-consuming and require substantial investment. Significant delays in new product releases or difficulties in developing new products could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or maintain our technological advantage.\nOur growth depends on the ability of our products to attain broad market acceptance.\nThe market for traditional fixed-base coordinate measurement machines, or CMMs, check fixtures, handheld measurement tools, and surveying equipment is mature. Part of our strategy is to continue to displace these traditional measurement devices. Displacing traditional measurement devices and achieving broad market acceptance for our products requires significant effort to convince customers to reevaluate their historical measurement procedures and methodologies.\nWe market closely interdependent hardware products and related software for use in measurement, inspection, and high density surveying applications. Substantially all of our revenues are currently derived from sales of these products and software, and we plan to continue our business strategy of focusing on the software-driven, 3D measurement and imaging solutions market. Consequently, our financial performance will depend, in large part, on computer-based measurement, inspection and high density surveying products achieving broad market acceptance. If our products cannot attain broad market acceptance, we will not grow as anticipated and may be required to make increased expenditures on research and development for new applications or new products.\nWe may not be able to identify or consummate acquisitions or achieve expected benefits from or effectively integrate acquisitions, which could harm our growth.\nOur growth strategy partly depends on our ability to obtain additional technologies, complementary product lines and sales channels through selective acquisitions and strategic investments. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions, if necessary, on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In the past, we have used our stock as consideration for acquisitions. Our common stock may not remain at a price at which it can be used as consideration for acquisitions without diluting our existing shareholders, and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively.\nIn addition, realization of the benefits of acquisitions often requires integration of some or all of the sales and marketing, distribution, manufacturing, engineering, software development, customer service, finance and administrative organizations of the acquired companies. The integration of acquisitions demands substantial attention from senior management and the management of the acquired companies. Our recent acquisitions are, and any future acquisitions may be, subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including:\n\u2022the inability to assimilate effectively the operations, products, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies (some of which may be located in diverse geographic regions);\n\u2022the inability of the acquired business to meet our performance expectations;\n\u2022the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022the need or obligation to divest portions of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022the potential impairment of relationships with customers.\nWe cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate any suitable acquisitions, that any acquired companies will operate profitably, or that we will realize the expected synergies and other benefits from any acquisition.\nThe buying process for most of our customers for our measurement products is highly decentralized and typically requires significant time and expense for us to further penetrate the potential market of a specific customer, which may delay our ability to generate additional revenue.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to further penetrate our customer base. During 2021, approximately 82% of our revenue was attributable to sales to our existing customers. If we are not able to continue to further penetrate our existing customer base, our future sales may decline. However, most of our customers have a decentralized buying process for measurement devices, and we must spend significant time and resources to increase revenues from a specific customer. For example, we may provide products to only one of our customer\u2019s manufacturing facilities or for a specific product line within a manufacturing facility. We cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase the amount of sales to our existing customers, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a global pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. Our operations are significantly vulnerable to the effects of pandemics, such as COVID-19, which have, and could continue to materially impact our business.\nWe are significantly vulnerable to the economic effects of pandemics and other public health crises, including the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak that has surfaced in every country of our global operating footprint. The impact of COVID-19 or COVID-19 variants including the severity of other additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of cases in areas in which we operate, disruptions to our business, changes in consumer behaviors, restrictions on individual and business activities, and financial liquidity concerns, has created significant volatility in the macro-economic environment and initially led to reduced economic activity. There have been and continues to be material actions taken by global government authorities to contain and slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans, quarantines, and stay-at-home orders to restrict activities for individuals and businesses.\nMost of our non-manufacturing and technical service personnel continue to work from home, which began in March 2020. Our global manufacturing operations, including facilities located in Pennsylvania, Florida and Germany continue to be designated as essential business and therefore continue to operate. To protect our employees in facilities in which our teams operate, we have employed preventative measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees. We ensure our preventative measures are in compliance with the most recent local governmental regulations and requirements.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and results of operations will depend on future events and developments, such as the duration and magnitude of the outbreak and future possible subsequent outbreaks. The impacts of the pandemic include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Potential production slowdowns of our factories in impacted countries or potential supply and distribution chain disruption, which could in the future result in increased costs and decreased efficiency, and which have and could impact our ability to respond to rapid changes in demand;\n\u2022The demand for our products and services, and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets, including potential trade customer financial restructuring or insolvency and increases in uncollectible accounts receivable balances with our trade customer base; Potential future impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions;\n\u2022Potential significant disruption of global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future, and which has, together with operational impacts noted above, necessitated certain recent liquidity creation and preservation actions as a precautionary measure;\n\u2022Fluctuations in forecasted earnings before tax and corresponding volatility in our effective tax rate;\n\u2022Potential operational disruption if key employees terminate their employment or become ill, as well as diversion of our management team's attention from non-COVID-19 related matters; and\n\u2022Potential investigations, legal claims or litigation against us for actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the pandemic;\nAs such, the ultimate impact on our financial condition and results of operations cannot be determined at this time. In 2021, we have been adversely affected and continue to expect our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our trade customers, suppliers, consumers, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed for the year ended December 31, 2021, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced a significant transition in our executive management team in the last three years. Any delay in the integration of our executive management team or our failure to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur executive management team has gone through a significant transition in the last three years, including the hiring of a new President and Chief Executive Officer and the hiring of a new Chief Financial Officer. Any delay in the integration of our executive management team could affect our ability to develop, implement and execute our business strategies and plans, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we fail to successfully attract qualified personnel or to retain our executive management team and other key personnel, our sales, profitability and growth and our ability to execute our business strategies and plans could be adversely impacted. Turnover of management could also adversely impact our stock price and our client relationships and could make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. We face competition for qualified personnel, which could result in increased salaries and other compensation expenses and could negatively affect our profitability.\nWe derive a substantial part of our revenues from our international operations, which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations.\nWe derive more than half of our revenues from international operations. Our international operations are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022compliance with export and import regulations, including tariffs, and trade restrictions;\n\u2022governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States; and\n\u2022burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices.\nSeveral of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies, which may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. These factors may harm our results of operations and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective.\nWe may experience volatility in our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in demand for, and sales of, our products or prolonged downturns in the industries that we serve;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022general economic uncertainties;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community; and\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors.\nThe market price of our common stock may also be affected by our inability to meet analyst and investor expectations and failure to achieve projected financial results. Any failure to meet such expectations or projected financial results, even if minor,\ncould cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Volatility in our stock price may result in the inability of our shareholders to sell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased them.\nOur relatively small public float and daily trading volume have in the past caused, and may in the future result in, significant volatility in our stock price. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 18.1 million shares outstanding held by non-affiliates. Our daily trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2021 averaged approximately 82,794 shares.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced in the past and may in the future experience a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market prices of equity securities of many companies have experienced in the past and may in the future experience wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies\u2019 securities. If any such litigation is instigated against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks of natural disasters and other catastrophic events.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as fires, explosions, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather, or the occurrence of acts of war, political unrest, terrorist activities or labor issues, including due to public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics, where we have a manufacturing facility could result in physical damage to, and complete or partial closure of, our manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. Interruptions in our manufacturing operations or damage to our manufacturing facilities could reduce our revenues and increase our costs, and the extent of losses from natural disasters, severe weather and such other events will be a function of both the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposure. Although we maintain insurance coverage, we can offer no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses or that we will be able to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost in the future. If losses from business interruption or property damage exceed the amounts for which we are insured, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDevelopments relating to the United Kingdom's (\u201cUK\u201d) exit from European Union membership could adversely impact our business.\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Following a protracted period of negotiation, the UK ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020, after the ratification and approval of a withdrawal agreement by the European Union and the UK. The withdrawal agreement provided for a transition period until December 31, 2020 (the \u201cTransition Period\u201d), during which the terms of the future trading relationship between the European Union and the UK were negotiated. Throughout the Transition Period, the legal and regulatory framework between the UK and the European Union had remained the same.\nBrexit and the perceptions as to its potential impact have and may continue to adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in Europe and globally and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets after the Transition Period. Brexit could also have the effect of imposing greater restrictions on, and costs associated with, imports and exports between the UK and European Union member states, including, without limitation, the imposition of tariffs and increased regulatory complexities. The hiring and retention of skilled labor may also become more challenging if the free movement of workers between the European Union and the UK ends. We may also be impacted by potential exchange rate volatility. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business and operating results by adversely affecting customer demand and our relationships with customers in the UK and the European Union. In addition, as a result of Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the European Union.\nGiven these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which we will be affected by Brexit is uncertain. Any of the potential negative effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face difficulties managing the effects of any future growth.\nIf our business grows rapidly in the future, we expect it to result in:\n\u2022increased complexity;\n\u2022increased responsibility for existing and new management personnel; and\n\u2022incremental strain on our operations and financial and management systems.\nIf we are not able to manage the effects of any future growth, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nIf our efforts to develop our current services towards a subscription based business model do not succeed, we may reduce our revenue growth rate and profitability, fail to keep pace with technological developments and harm our business.\nWe are currently developing cloud computing application services to deliver new and existing software offerings. The markets for our 3D measurement, imaging and realization clouds remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of a significant platform change, including our Sphere platform, and introduction of new services, may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our continued efforts to develop new and existing services may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to rapidly enhance or develop new features for the technology underlying our future subscription based business model that keep pace with the current and future technological environment, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and user acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement. Further, because our services will be designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in identifying the technology trends and developing the enhancements, or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.\nReductions in defense spending could adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our customers operate in the defense sector and depend significantly on U.S. government spending. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011, which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending through 2021. Automatic spending reductions, referred to as sequestration, were implemented in March 2013. Ongoing budgetary discussions in the federal government may result in other cuts to defense spending. Reductions in defense spending that impact the aerospace and defense industries, or uncertainty regarding future levels of government expenditures, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result, which may have impacts in addition to those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations, including payment delays, impairment of our ability to perform work on existing contracts and reductions in future orders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and provisions of Florida law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor.\nOur articles of incorporation, bylaws and provisions of Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Although we believe such provisions are appropriate to protect long-term value for our shareholders, these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our shares. Because of these provisions, you might not be able to receive a premium on your investment. These provisions include:\n\u2022a limitation on shareholders\u2019 ability to call a special meeting of our shareholders;\n\u2022advance notice requirements to nominate directors for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022our classified board of directors, which means that approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year; and\n\u2022the authority of the board of directors to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nThe provisions described above could delay or make more difficult transactions involving a change in control of the Company or our management.\nOur bylaws designate specific courts in Florida as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by the Company\u2019s shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim or breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Florida Business Corporation Act or the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation or bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, will be a state court located within Seminole County in the State of Florida (or, if no such state court within Seminole County has jurisdiction, another state court located within the State of Florida, or if no such other state court located within the State of Florida has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the Middle District of Florida) (the \u201cFlorida Forum Provision\u201d). The Florida Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the Florida Forum Provision; provided, however, that shareholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe Florida Forum Provision in our bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on shareholders in pursuing any such claims. Additionally, the Florida Forum Provision may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our shareholders. In addition, if the Florida Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The Florida Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on shareholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The courts specified in the Florida Forum Provision may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a shareholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOur financial performance is dependent on the conditions of various industries, including the automotive, aerospace, and heavy-equipment industries, which have from time to time experienced, and may again experience, significant disruptions in the economic environment.\nA significant portion of our sales are to manufacturers in the automotive, aerospace, and heavy equipment industries. We are dependent upon the continued viability and financial stability of our customers in these industries, which are highly cyclical and dependent upon the general health of the economy and consumer spending.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, we face significant exposure to foreign exchange rate risk.\nOur results of operations are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, which have caused, and may in the future cause, significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and could result in potentially significant foreign exchange gains and losses. Additionally, currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to those customers. If we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, we could be forced to sell our products at a lower margin or at a net loss. To the extent that the percentage of our non-U.S. dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future, our exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase.\nWe may be unable to recognize the anticipated benefits of our Restructuring Plan and our new strategic plan.\nOn February 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a global Restructuring Plan, which is intended to support our new strategic plan in an effort to improve operating performance and ensure that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders and customers. Key activities under the Restructuring Plan include a continued focus on efficiency and cost-saving efforts, which includes decreasing total headcount by approximately 500 employees upon completion of the Restructuring Plan. These activities are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first half of 2022. Actual results, including the costs of the Restructuring Plan, may differ materially from our expectations, resulting in our inability to realize the expected benefits of the Restructuring Plan and our new strategic plan and negatively impacting our ability to execute our future plans and strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tariffs and other export regulations could increase the cost of our products sold to our international customers, which could negatively impact our sales and profitability.\nOur international sales operations are subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations and policies, including but not limited to tariffs and other export regulations. Changes in export regulations could increase the cost of our products sold as exports to our international customers. If our international customers are not willing to absorb the incremental costs resulting from those tariffs or other export regulations, it could negatively impact our sales to such customers, as well as our profitability.\nWe may not be able to achieve financial results within our target goals, and our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to achieve financial results that are within our goals is subject to a number of factors beyond our control. Moreover, our annual and quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and likely will vary significantly in the future. Factors that cause our financial results to fluctuate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022adverse changes in the manufacturing industry and general economic conditions;\n\u2022the effectiveness of sales promotions;\n\u2022geographic expansion in our regions;\n\u2022training and ramp-up time for new sales people;\n\u2022investments in strategic sales, product or other initiatives;\n\u2022investments in technologies and new products and product enhancements, including costs associated with new development and product introductions, and the timing and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022manufacturing inefficiencies related to new product introductions;\n\u2022excess or obsolete inventory, shrinkage or other inventory losses due to product obsolescence, change in demand for our products, scrap or material price changes;\n\u2022impairment charges of goodwill or intangible assets;\n\u2022expansion of our manufacturing capability;\n\u2022the size and timing of customer orders, many of which are received towards the end of a quarter;\n\u2022the amount of time that it takes to fulfill orders and ship our products;\n\u2022the length of our sales cycle to new customers;\n\u2022customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022start-up costs and ramp-up time associated with opening new sales offices outside of the United States;\n\u2022variations in our effective income tax rate and difficulty in predicting our effective tax rate on a quarterly and annual basis; and\n\u2022litigation and regulatory action brought against us.\nAny one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly operating results in the future and could cause us to fail to achieve our target financial results.\nFuture impairments of our goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the historical and projected future performance of certain of our recently acquired operations were lower than our expectations, the technologies, intellectual property, know-how and related intangibles were no longer aligned with our go-forward strategies, and due to other initiatives in connection with our new strategic plan, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment of $35.2 million related primarily to goodwill and intangible assets which was included in operating expenses. Further, we disposed of certain of our operations in the second quarter of 2020. See Note 19, \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the impairment. We currently hold a total of $25.6 million in intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, and $82.1 million in goodwill at December 31, 2021. Events may occur or circumstances may change such that the carrying value is not recoverable or it becomes more likely than not that the fair value of long-lived assets is reduced below the carrying value of the assets, which could result in a further write-down of our assets.\nIn addition, certain of our long-lived assets such as leasehold improvements, machinery, equipment, and sales demonstration assets may experience impairment as a result of events such as the closure of sites, introduction of new products, decisions to exit certain products or markets, and changes in technology. We depreciate long-lived assets and amortize intangible assets at levels we believe are adequate; however, an impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our financial statements could contain a material misstatement, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal controls over financial reporting. As part of this process, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting, management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal controls over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to adequately establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our financial statements may contain material misstatements, and we could be required to restate our financial results. This could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and adversely affect our business, our financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is directly impacted by the application of complex tax laws and regulations and is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of our worldwide earnings or losses, the tax regulations in each country or geographic region in which we operate, and the availability of tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Our provision for income taxes and tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by many factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretation of accounting principles. Application of tax laws and regulations is also subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty. Further, tax laws are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy and legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings.\nThe income and non-income tax regimes we are subject to or operate under may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Certain countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) has continued to issue guidelines and proposals related to its Base Erosion and Profit Sharing initiative, which could potentially result in legislative changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations, as well as impact our effective tax rate and the value of our deferred tax assets.\nA valuation allowance may be required for our Dutch deferred tax assets, which may reduce our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur balance sheet includes $21.3 million in deferred tax assets. Approximately 80% of that amount relates to Dutch deferred tax assets. On a quarterly basis, we assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets to ensure no valuation allowance is required. The ultimate realization of our Dutch deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the Netherlands during the periods in which those deferred tax assets would be deductible. Based on an evaluation we conducted, we determined that it was not necessary to establish a valuation allowance against any of our Dutch deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. However, we will continue to monitor whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if we are required to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related To Product Development And Regulatory Process\nProduct failures or product availability and performance issues could result in increased warranty costs and delays in new product introductions and enhancements, and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe regularly introduce new products and enhance existing products. The impact of new product introductions, including the costs associated with new product introductions, such as product development, marketing, assembly line start-up costs and low introductory period production volumes, and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with new product introductions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Failures in, or performance issues impacting, our new or existing products could result in increased warranty costs, product recall costs, delays in new product introductions or existing product enhancements, and a loss of sales and customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The supply of raw materials for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key vendor could delay shipments, which may decrease product availability, causing a loss of sales and customers.\nIncreases in the cost and constraints in the availability of raw materials or components used in our products could negatively impact our business and profitability.\nOur products contain various raw materials, including steel, steel byproducts, aluminum, aluminum byproducts, resin products and various electronic components. We use raw materials directly in manufacturing and in components that we purchase from our suppliers. These raw materials are subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations, policies, including tariffs and other import restrictions, inflationary pressures, and supply shortages. Changes to the laws, governmental regulations and policies governing these raw materials, including tariffs and other import restrictions, have increased and could continue to increase the cost of such raw materials and, correspondingly, the cost of manufacturing our products. Further, interruptions in global supply chains and inflationary pressures have increased and could continue to increase the cost of such raw materials, and have constrained and could continue to constrain the availability of such raw materials. If the costs of our raw materials further increase, whether due to changes in laws, governmental regulations, policies, supply shortages or for other reasons, we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even in the event that increased costs can be substantially passed through to our customers, our gross margin percentages would decline.\nWe compete with manufacturers of measurement systems and traditional measurement devices, many of which have more resources than us and may develop new products and technologies.\nOur measurement systems compete in the broad and highly competitive market for measurement devices for manufacturing and industrial applications, which, in addition to portable articulated arms, laser trackers, 3D imaging and laser scanner products, consist of fixed-base CMMs, templates and go/no-go gages, check fixtures, handheld measurement tools, and various categories of surveying equipment. In the FaroArm\u00ae, FARO ScanArm, FARO Laser TrackerTM, and FARO Focus product lines, we compete primarily with Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, a division of Hexagon AB; Automated Precision, Inc.; Artec Europe, S.a.r.l.; Leica Geosystems AG, a division of Hexagon AB; Creaform, a division of Ametek; and Trimble Inc. In the FARO Laser Projector product line, we compete primarily with Virtek Vision International, a division of Gerber Technology LLC. In our cloud based virtual reality capturing software, HolobuilderTM product line, we compete primarily with Matterport. We also compete in these product lines with a number of other smaller companies. We compete on the basis of technical innovation, product performance, quality and price with respect to all of our products.\nWe will be required to make continued investments in technology and product development to maintain the technological advantage that we believe we currently have over our competition. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we possess. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our technology or our product development efforts will allow us to successfully compete as the industry evolves. If the market for our measurement systems expands, additional competition may emerge and our existing and future competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we participate. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by pricing strategies pursued by competitors or technological or product developments by competitors.\nWe are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certification processes and regulations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust and competition, the environment, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered electronic products and components, import and export of products, currency conversions and repatriation, taxation of foreign earnings and use of local employees and suppliers. An inability to comply with these regulations or obtain any necessary certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nManufacturers of electrical goods are subject to the European Union\u2019s RoHS2 and WEEE directives, which took effect during 2006. RoHS2 prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products, and WEEE makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of covered electronic products and components. While we currently hold RoHS2 and WEEE registration and believe we are in compliance with the directives of the European Union, including the RoHS2 directive, parallel initiatives are being proposed in other jurisdictions, including several states in the United States and China. If we do not comply with any such initiatives, our sales and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nIn addition, a number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which we collect, process and transfer personal data. Most notably, the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, expands data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significantly increased fines for noncompliance, requiring additional compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business, including the United States, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities that involve the processing of personal data. Compliance with enhanced data protection laws requires additional resources and efforts, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines and costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements, and noncompliance could expose us to liability or impede current or future business.\nThe Government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either at their discretion or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract, which could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders. The failure to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, fines or other sanctions and penalties. Additionally, violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting.\nWe have sold our products and related services to the U.S. Government (the \u201cGovernment\u201d) under General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) Federal Supply Schedule contracts (the \u201cGSA Contracts\u201d) since 2002. Each GSA Contract is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and includes, among other provisions, a price reduction clause (the \u201cPrice Reduction Clause\u201d), which generally requires us to reduce the prices billed to the Government under the GSA Contracts to correspond to the lowest prices billed to certain benchmark customers.\nLate in the fourth quarter of 2018, during an internal review we preliminarily determined that certain of our pricing practices may have resulted in the Government being overcharged under the Price Reduction Clauses of the GSA Contracts (the \u201cGSA Matter\u201d). As a result, we performed remediation efforts, including but not limited to, the identification of additional controls and procedures to ensure future compliance with the pricing and other requirements of the GSA Contracts. We also retained outside legal counsel and forensic accountants to assist with these efforts and to conduct a comprehensive review of our pricing and other practices under the GSA Contracts (the \u201cReview\u201d). On February 14, 2019, we reported the GSA Matter to the GSA and its Office of Inspector General.\nEffective as of February 25, 2021, as a result of the review, we entered into a settlement agreement with the GSA. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we agreed to, among other things, pay to the GSA $12.3 million in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims, causes of actions, appeals and the like, including damages, costs, attorney's fees and interest\narising under or related to the GSA Matter. As of March 31, 2021, we settled and paid the full $12.3 million and no longer have any outstanding liability related to this matter.\nFor sales to the Government beginning in 2022, we expect to sell our products and related services through approved distributors. We chose to make this change in our sales strategy to simplify operations and mitigate compliance risk. The Government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with our distributors either at their discretion or if these distributors default by failing to perform under the terms of their applicable contract, which could impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders.\nAny failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-corruption laws could subject us to fines and penalties.\nIn 2012, our monitorship expired pursuant to our settlement with the SEC and the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, concerning certain payments made by our subsidiary in China that may have violated the FCPA and other applicable laws. We are, of course, still subject to such laws and have adopted and maintain a compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws; however, in light of our prior conduct, any future failure to comply with any such continuing obligations could result in the SEC and the DOJ aggressively seeking to impose penalties against us. In addition, many countries in which we operate have increased regulation regarding anti-corruption practices generally. Compliance with such regulations could be costly and could adversely impact our results of operations or delay entry into new markets.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nAny failure to protect our patents and proprietary rights in the United States and foreign countries could adversely affect our revenues.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights protection for our processes and products in the United States and other countries. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing inventions to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our technology and trade secrets, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors. However, our employees may breach these agreements, or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by inventors. If we are unable to obtain or maintain protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, despite our efforts to protect our patents and other proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, particularly in foreign countries, and we may be unable to determine the extent, if any, to which unauthorized uses of our products exist. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nOur patent protection involves complex legal and technical questions. Our patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Further, we may be able to protect our proprietary rights from infringement by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary processes and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies. Litigation or other proceedings to defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant time and money, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nClaims from others that we infringed on their intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from others claiming that we infringed on their intellectual property rights. Resolving these claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products, or require us to pay damages. In addition, from time to time, we are involved in intellectual property lawsuits. We could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any litigation or interference proceedings, regardless of their outcome, may be costly and may require significant time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nRisks Related To Reliance On Third Parties\nOur dependence on suppliers for materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products.\nOutside vendors provide key components, such as electronic components and semiconductors, used in the manufacture of our products. Any supply interruption in a limited source component would hinder our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier\u2019s variation in a component, either known or unknown, or incompatibility with our manufacturing processes, could hinder our ability to manufacture our products. We may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable period of time, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the manufacture of components of our products, we may experience delays or interruptions in our operations, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our business reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on our information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to, among other things:\n\u2022facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items;\n\u2022receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022accurately bill and collect from customers;\n\u2022process payments to suppliers and employees; and\n\u2022summarize results and manage our business.\nOur primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees. Though losses arising from some of these issues may be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business computer systems or failure of our back-up systems could lead to a loss of sales or decreased profitability.\nA cyberattack or security breach of our systems may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our internal data and the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or their data. Computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to penetrate our network security and our website. Unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. Cyber incidents have been increasing in sophistication and frequency and can include third parties gaining access to employee or customer data using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, ransomware, card skimming code, and other deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers, suppliers or other vendors.\nAny security breach, cyberattack or cyber security breach, and any incident involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, sensitive or confidential customer information, whether involving us or involving one of our vendors, could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage, could interrupt our operations and damage our reputation, and could also result in regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. We have in the past experienced security incidents, and we may in the future experience other data security incidents or breaches affecting personally identifiable information or other confidential business information. If new customers or existing customers believe that our systems do not provide adequate security for the storage of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information, they may choose not to engage in business with us. Additionally, actual, potential or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.", "PERMNO": 85372, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "FARO"}
