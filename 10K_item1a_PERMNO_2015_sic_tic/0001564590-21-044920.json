RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in Part II, Item 1A titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks related to our business and results of operations\n\u2022\nThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022\nIf our products do not achieve widespread market acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\n\u2022\nOur ability to achieve profitability depends in part on maintaining or increasing our gross margins on product sales and services.\n\u2022\nWe have outstanding indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\n\u2022\nOur operating results, including our quarterly orders, revenues and margins fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be unpredictable, which may result in a decline in our stock price.\n\u2022\nOur industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological change. If we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands, our products may become obsolete or less useful and our operating results will suffer.\n\u2022\nInternational sales of our products account for a significant portion of our revenue, which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations.\n\u2022\nEnhanced international tariffs that affect our products or components within our products, other trade barriers or a global trade war could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe face risks related to the current global economic environment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nIf we encounter manufacturing problems, or if our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal, state or foreign manufacturing standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations, which would result in delays and lost revenue.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to develop new products or enhance existing products to meet our customers\u2019 needs and compete favorably in the market, we may be unable to attract or retain customers.\n\u2022\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth, our business may be significantly harmed.\n\u2022\nWe could become subject to product liability claims, product recalls, other field actions and warranty claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\n\u2022\nOur reliance on single-source suppliers for critical components of our products could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely and cost effective manner.\n\u2022\nWe depend on key employees, the loss of whom would adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nDisruption of critical information technology systems, infrastructure and data or cyberattacks could harm our business and financial condition.\n\u2022\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with legal or regulatory requirements related to privacy, cyber security and data protection in one or multiple jurisdictions could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us.\n\u2022\nThe safety and efficacy of our products for certain uses is not yet supported by long-term clinical data, and our products may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought.\n\u2022\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our product.\n\u2022\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\n\u2022\nBecause the majority of our product revenue is derived from sales of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, which have a long and variable sales and installation cycle, our revenues and cash flows may be volatile and difficult to predict.\nRisks related to the regulation of our products and business\n\u2022\nModifications, upgrades, new indications and future products related to our products may require new FDA 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals and similar licensing or approvals in international markets. Such modifications, or any defects in design, manufacture or labeling may require us to recall or cease marketing the affected systems or software until approvals or clearances are obtained.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our operations, the violation of which could result in substantial penalties and harm our business.\n\u2022\nIf we or our distributors do not obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in a specific country, we will not be able to market and sell our products in that country.\n\u2022\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect demand for our products, our revenue and our financial condition.\n\u2022\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nRisks related to our common stock\n\u2022\nThe price of our common stock is volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which could lead to losses for stockholders.\n\u2022\nThe conditional conversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nProvisions in the indenture for the Notes, the credit agreement for our New Credit Facility, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could discourage or prevent a takeover, even if an acquisition would be beneficial in the opinion of our stockholders.\nGeneral Risks\n\u2022\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss because of natural disasters, global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, terrorist acts and other events beyond our control, which would adversely affect our business.\nRisk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, a number of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business, financial condition and future results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted, causing the trading price of our common stock to decline. In addition, these risks and uncertainties may impact the \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated herein by reference. They could affect our actual results of operations, causing them to differ materially from those expressed in \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Results of Operations\nThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the perception of its effects, as well as the responses of governments and private industry on our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers, have and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, surfaced in Wuhan, China and was subsequently declared a pandemic, which has affected, and continues to affect, the worldwide economy, global operations and global supply chains. In addition, new variants of COVID-19 that are more contagious have also spread throughout the world. The pandemic continues to be prevalent and related government and private sector responsive actions have impacted and will likely continue to adversely affect our business operations. Although vaccines are now available, deployment of such vaccines around the world has been slow and the impact on any potential recovery is unclear. It is impossible to predict the full extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, financial condition or the economy.\nGovernments, public institutions, and other organizations are taking certain preventative or protective measures to combat the spread of the pandemic. While we are unable to predict the full impact of the pandemic, we are closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and are continually assessing its potential effects on our business. As a result of timing delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have and are continuing to experience disruptions in our sales and revenue cycle as well as declines in deliveries and installations of our products, which has adversely impacted the pace at which our backlog converts to revenue. These timing delays have been a result of various factors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, including disruptions in the operations of our customers that have redirected customer resources to the COVID-19 response and away from purchases of capital equipment such as our products, disruptions and restrictions on our ability to travel to customer sites, disruptions in our supply chain, and manufacturing interruptions. We have also experienced delays in payment and planned installations as a result of the changes to and redirection of customer resources to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and closures of customer facilities. A few customers have also requested to extend payment terms or temporarily suspend service and corresponding payment obligations and while we have only received a small number of requests thus far, as the pandemic and its effects continue, more customers may ask for the same, particularly, if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic deepen or worsen. Additionally, to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have also made substantial modifications to employee travel and suspended non-essential work travel, implemented remote work arrangements as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted most of our conferences and other marketing events to virtual through fiscal year 2021. In addition, other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have included and could include significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products, a deepening of the changes to the operations and workflows of our customers that could result in increased customer defaults or delays in payment; additional delays, cancellations and redirection of planned capital expenditures and installations of our system by our customers to focus resources on COVID-19; disruptions in our supply chain or a reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes resulting in our inability to meet demand for our products; or closures of our key facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers. Further, a lack of coordinated response on or compliance with risk mitigation and vaccination deployment with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant increases to the duration and severity of the pandemic and could have a corresponding negative impact on our business. These impacts and others that have resulted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented measures to slow the spread of the virus globally have had and will continue to have a negative impact on our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in 2020, there was a global economic slowdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which adversely impacted our revenue, net income (loss) and cash flow and resulted in additional expenditures required to mitigate such impacts. These impacts could continue to affect our business as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity. The extent to which our operations and financial condition are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will largely depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time and are uncertain, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic (including the severity of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases in areas in which we operate) or new or additional actions taken to contain COVID-19 or address its impact, and the timing of global recovery and economic normalization, among others. The situation is developing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently, however, the COVID-19 pandemic or the perception of its effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it, may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIf the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms do not achieve widespread market acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\nAchieving physician, patient, hospital administrator and third-party payor acceptance of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms as preferred methods of tumor treatment is crucial to our continued success. Physicians will not begin to use or increase the use of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms unless they determine, based on experience, clinical data and other factors, that the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms are safe and effective alternatives to traditional treatment methods. Further, physicians may be slow to adopt new or updated versions of our CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party payors, particularly in light of ongoing health care reform initiatives and the evolving U.S. health care environment. If we are not able to expand market acceptance of our products and maintain and increase our base of installed systems, or installed base, then sales of our products may not meet expectations. Any failure to expand and protect our existing installed base could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe often need to educate physicians about the use of stereotactic radiosurgery, image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and adaptive radiation therapy, convince healthcare payors that the benefits of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and their related treatment processes outweigh their costs, and help train qualified physicians in the skilled use of these systems. In addition, we also must educate prospective customers regarding the entire functionality of our radiation therapy systems and their relative benefits compared to alternative products and treatment methods. We must also increase awareness among potential patients, who are increasingly educated about treatment options and therefore impact adoption of new technologies by clinicians. We have expended and will continue to expend significant resources on marketing and educational efforts to create awareness of stereotactic radiosurgery and robotic intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as well as adaptive radiation therapy and IGRT generally and to encourage the acceptance and adoption of our products for these technologies. We cannot be sure that our products will gain significant market acceptance among physicians, patients and healthcare payors, even if we spend significant time and expense on their education.\nIn addition to achieving market acceptance of our products and the need to educate physicians and others about the benefits of our products, the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms are major capital purchases, and purchase decisions are greatly influenced by hospital administrators who are subject to increasing pressures to reduce costs. In addition, hospitals and other health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone meetings with potential suppliers in response to the spread of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, effectively delaying the decision on potential purchases of new products such as ours. These and other factors, including the following, may affect the rate and level of market acceptance of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms:\n\u2022\nthe CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms\u2019 price relative to other products or competing treatments;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new products and enhancements and receive regulatory clearances and approval, if required, to such products in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nincreased scrutiny by state boards when evaluating certificates of need requested by purchasing institutions;\n\u2022\nperception by patients, physicians and other members of the healthcare community of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms\u2019 safety, efficacy, efficiency and benefits compared to competing technologies or treatments;\n\u2022\nwillingness of physicians to adopt new techniques and the ability of physicians to acquire the skills necessary to operate the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms;\n\u2022\nextent of third-party coverage and reimbursement rates, particularly from Medicare, for procedures using the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms; and\n\u2022\ndevelopment of new products and technologies by our competitors or new treatment alternatives.\nIf the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms are unable to achieve or maintain market acceptance, new orders and sales of our systems would be adversely affected, our revenue levels would decrease and our business would be harmed.\nOur ability to achieve profitability depends in part on maintaining or increasing our gross margins on product sales and services, which we may not be able to achieve.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $488.0 million. We may incur net losses in the future, particularly as selling and marketing activities increase ahead of any expected revenue. Our ability to achieve and sustain long-term profitability is largely dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, control our costs, and effectively manage our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve profitability and even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. In the event we fail to achieve profitability, our stock price could decline.\nOur ability to achieve profitability also depends on our ability to maintain or increase our gross margins on product sales and services. A number of factors may adversely impact such gross margins, including:\n\u2022\nlower than expected manufacturing yields of high cost components leading to increased manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\nlow production volume, which will result in high levels of overhead cost per unit of production;\n\u2022\nour ability to sell products and services, recognize revenue from our sales and the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;\n\u2022\nincreased material or labor costs;\n\u2022\nincreased inventory costs and liabilities for excess inventory resulting from inventory held in excess of forecasted demand;\n\u2022\nincreased service or warranty costs or the failure to reduce service or warranty costs;\n\u2022\nincreased price competition;\n\u2022\nvariation in the margins across products installed in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges to U.S. and foreign trade policies, including enactments of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. and any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including our products; and\n\u2022\nhow well we execute on our strategic and operating plans.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase our gross margins on product sales and service, our results of operations could be adversely impacted, we may not achieve profitability and our stock price could decline.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness in the form of Convertible Senior Notes and a credit facility and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nIn August 2017, we issued $85.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201c3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022\u201d). In May 2021, we issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026\u201d and collectively, with the 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022, the \u201cNotes\u201d). As our debt matures, we anticipate having to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance the Notes. For example, in May 2021, in connection with the issuance of the 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026, we (i) exchanged approximately $82.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 for approximately $97.1 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 and (ii) sold approximately $2.9 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 for cash. If we decide to refinance the Notes in the future, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the Notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn May 2021, we entered into a credit agreement that provided us with a five-year $80.0 million term loan (the \u201cNew Term Loan Facility\u201d) and $40.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cNew Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the \u201cNew Term Loan Facility\u201d, the \u201cNew Credit Facilities\u201d). The proceeds from the New Credit Facilities, plus available cash on hand, were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our prior credit facility.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had total consolidated liabilities of approximately $411.3 million; including long-term liability components of the Notes of $75.1 million, the New Revolving Credit Facility of $20.0 million and the New Term Loan Facility of $78.7 million, of which $3.8 million is classified as short-term loan. Our existing and future levels of indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders and note holders and may adversely affect our financial conditions and future financial results by, among other things:\n\u2022\naffecting our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and New Credit Facilities;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to interest and principal payments, which may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nimpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general, including any such downturn related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe credit agreement governing the New Credit Facilities also include certain restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to (i) incur indebtedness, (ii) incur liens on their property, (iii) pay dividends or make other distributions, (iv) sell their assets, (v) make certain loans or investments, (vi) merge or consolidate, (vii) voluntarily repay or prepay certain indebtedness and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, such agreements require us to meet certain financial covenants, including a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated senior net leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement governing the New Credit Facilities. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. Our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms governing the New Credit Facilities will depend in part on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. In addition, because our assets are pledged as a security under the New Credit Facilities, if we are not able to cure any default or repay outstanding borrowings, our assets are subject to the risk of foreclosure by our lenders. From time to time, we may not be in compliance with such covenants or other terms governing the New Credit Facilities and we may be required to obtain waivers or\namendments to the credit agreement from our lenders in order to maintain compliance and there can be no certainty that any such waiver or amendment will be available, or what the cost of such waiver or amendment, if obtained, would be. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under such credit facility is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates, which may not be favorable to us. Additionally, a default on indebtedness could result in a default under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nOur operating results, including our quarterly orders, revenues and margins fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be unpredictable, which may result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe have experienced and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our operating results, including gross orders, revenues and margins, from period to period. Drivers of orders include the introduction and timing of new product or product enhancement announcements by us and our competitors, the timing of regulatory approvals, changes in price by us and our competitors as well as changes or anticipated changes in third-party reimbursement amounts or policies applicable to treatments using our products. The availability of economic stimulus packages or other government funding, or reductions thereof, may also affect timing of customer purchases. Our products have a high unit price and require significant capital expenditures by our customers. Accordingly, we experience long sales and implementation cycles, which is of greater concern during a volatile economic environment where we have had customers delay or cancel orders. The timing of when orders are placed, when installation, delivery or shipping, as applicable, is accomplished and when revenue is recognized affect our quarterly results. Further, because of the high unit price of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and the relatively small number of units sold or installed each quarter, each sale or installation of a CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform can represent a significant percentage of our net orders, backlog or revenue for a particular quarter and shifts in sales or installation from one quarter to another may have significant effects. For example, multi-system sales or sales involving negotiations with integrated delivery networks involve additional complexities to the transaction and require a longer timeline to finalize the sale, which make it more difficult to predict the quarter in which the sale will occur. In addition, we have experienced and are continuing to experience delays in orders and installations due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at our customer sites. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have also made substantial modifications to employee travel and suspended non-essential work travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers and partners, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time.\nOnce orders are received and booked into backlog, there is a risk that we may not recognize revenue in the near term or at all. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the pace at which the backlog converts to revenue. This is primarily the result of delays in the timing of deliveries and installations in fiscal 2020 and 2021 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in decreased revenue for these periods. We expect that such delays in deliveries and installations will continue to some degree into fiscal 2022, which could have a negative impact on our revenue during such period. Factors that may affect whether these orders become revenue (or are cancelled or deemed aged-out and reflected as a reduction in net orders) and the timing of revenue include:\n\u2022\neconomic or political instability, including volatility related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ndelays in the customer obtaining or inability of a customer to obtain funding or financing;\n\u2022\ndelays in construction at the customer site and delays in installation;\n\u2022\ndelays in the customer obtaining or inability of such customer to obtain local or foreign regulatory approvals such as certificates of need in certain states or Class A or Class B user licenses in China;\n\u2022\nthe terms of the applicable sales and service contracts of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms; and\n\u2022\nthe proportion of revenue attributable to orders placed by our distributors, which may be more difficult to forecast due to factors outside our control.\nOur operating results may also be affected by a number of other factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in business operations of our customers or vendors, construction at customer sites and installation, including such delays caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ntiming and level of expenditures associated with new product development activities;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements in some states for a certificate of need prior to the installation of a radiation device or foreign regulatory approvals, such as Class A or Class B user licenses in China;\n\u2022\ndelays in shipment due to, for example, unanticipated construction delays at customer locations where our products are to be installed, cancellations by customers, natural disasters, global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, or labor disturbances;\n\u2022\ndelays in our manufacturing processes or unexpected manufacturing difficulties;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the announcement, introduction and delivery of new products or product upgrades by us and by our competitors;\n\u2022\ntiming and level of expenditures associated with expansion of sales and marketing activities such as trade shows and our overall operations;\n\u2022\nthe timing and level of expenditures associated with our financing activities;\n\u2022\nthe effects of foreign currency adjustments;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles, such as those related to revenue recognition, or in the interpretation or the application thereof; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our gross margins and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations, as described in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the risk factor entitled, \u201cOur ability to achieve profitability depends in part on maintaining or increasing our gross margins on product sales and services, which we may not be able to achieve.\u201d\nBecause many of our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales and a high percentage of these expenses are fixed for the short term, a small variation in the timing of revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. Our overall gross margins are impacted by a number of factors described in our risk factor entitled \u201cOur ability to achieve profitability depends in part on maintaining or increasing our gross margins on product sales and services, which we may not be able to achieve.\u201d If our financial results fall below the expectation of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline.\nWe report our orders and backlog on a quarterly and annual basis. Unlike revenues, orders and backlog are not defined by U.S. GAAP, and are not within the scope of the audit conducted by our independent registered public accounting firm. Also, for the reasons discussed in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our orders and backlog cannot necessarily be relied upon as accurate predictors of future revenues. Order cancellation or significant delays in installation date will reduce our backlog and future revenues, and we cannot predict if or when orders will mature into revenues. Based on historical experience, approximately 26% of our $1,009.4 million open contracts may never result in revenue due to cancellation. In addition, we may experience an increase in cancellations beyond historical levels due to the uncertainties surrounding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly high levels of cancellations or age-outs in one or more periods may cause our revenue and gross margins to decline in current or future periods and will make it difficult to compare our operating results from quarter to quarter. We cannot assure you that our backlog will result in revenue on a timely basis or at all, or that any cancelled contracts will be replaced.\nOur industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in products or new tumor treatments that are superior to the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms. If we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands, our products may become obsolete or less useful and our operating results will suffer.\nThe medical device industry in general and the non-invasive cancer treatment field in particular are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. Because our products often have long development and government approval cycles, we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands. To compete successfully, we will need to continue to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over well-established alternative procedures, products and technologies, and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers of the advantages of our products and technologies. Traditional surgery and other forms of minimally invasive procedures, brachytherapy, chemotherapy or other drugs remain alternatives to the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms.\nWe consider the competition for the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms to be existing radiation therapy systems, primarily using C-arm linacs, which are sold by large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. Several of these competitors are also able to leverage their fixed sales, service and other costs over multiple products or product lines. In particular, we compete with a number of existing radiation therapy equipment companies, including Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\u201cVarian\u201d), which was recently acquired by Siemens Healthineers, Elekta AB (\u201cElekta\u201d), ViewRay, Inc., RefleXion Medical and Zap Medical. Varian has been the leader in the external beam radiation therapy market for many years and has the majority market share for radiation therapy systems worldwide. In general, because of aging demographics and attractive market factors in oncology, we believe that new competitors will enter the radiosurgery and radiation therapy markets in the years ahead. For example, Varian announced in 2012 a line of C-arm gantries, called the Edge systems, which Varian claims are specifically designed for radiosurgery to compete with our CyberKnife platform. In addition, some manufacturers of conventional linac based radiation therapy systems, including Varian and Elekta, have products that can be used in combination with body and/or head frames and image guidance systems to perform both radiosurgical and radiotherapy procedures. In May 2017, Varian launched a radiation therapy product called Halcyon which they have positioned against our TomoTherapy platform.\nFurthermore, many government, academic and business entities are investing substantial resources in research and development of cancer treatments, including surgical approaches, radiation treatment, MRI-guided radiotherapy systems, proton therapy systems, drug treatment, gene therapy (which is the treatment of disease by replacing, manipulating, or supplementing nonfunctional genes) and other approaches. Successful developments that result in new approaches for the treatment of cancer could reduce the attractiveness of our products or render them obsolete.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies. Rapid technological development may render the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and their technologies obsolete. Many of our competitors have or may have greater corporate, financial, operational, sales and marketing resources, and more experience and resources in research and development than we have. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products or that would render our technologies and products obsolete or less useful. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise, marketing, distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future. In addition, some of our competitors may compete by changing their pricing model or by lowering the price of their products. If we are unable to maintain or increase our selling prices, our revenue and gross margins may suffer. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies.\nInternational sales of our products account for a significant portion of our revenue, which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations.\nOur international sales are a significant percentage of our total revenue. The percentage of our revenue derived from sales outside of the Americas region was 73% in fiscal 2021, 66% in fiscal 2020, and 68% in fiscal 2019. To accommodate our international sales, we have invested significant financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure that will meet the needs of our customers. We anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from sales of our products in foreign markets and that the percentage of our overall revenue that is derived from these markets may continue to increase. This revenue and related operations will therefore continue to be subject to the risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022\neconomic or political instability in the world or in particular regions or countries in which we do business, including the market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) exit from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), or Brexit;\n\u2022\nimport delays;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the clearance, approval and sales of medical devices;\n\u2022\nthe potential failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements to sell and market our products;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles associated with many customers outside the United States;\n\u2022\ninability of customers to obtain requisite government approvals, such as customers in China, including customers of the JV, obtaining one of the limited number of Class A or Class B user licenses available in order to purchase our products;\n\u2022\neffective compliance with privacy, data protection and information security laws, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d);\n\u2022\nadequate coverage and reimbursement for the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platform treatment procedures outside the United States;\n\u2022\nfailure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors;\n\u2022\nU.S. trade and economic sanctions policies that are in effect from time to time and the possibility that foreign countries may impose additional taxes, tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions that are in effect from time to time, including U.S. prohibitions and restrictions on exports of certain products and technologies to certain nations and customers;\n\u2022\nthe unfamiliarity of shipping companies and other logistics providers with U.S. export control laws, which may lead to their unwillingness to ship or delays in shipping, our products to certain nations and customers despite such shipments being permitted under such laws;\n\u2022\nU.S. relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain required export or import licenses or approvals;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to foreign currency, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates possibly causing fewer sales due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar;\n\u2022\ncontractual provisions governed by foreign laws; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes and fires, and global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, such as COVID-19 or data privacy or security incidents, that may have a disproportionate effect in certain geographies resulting in decreased demand or decreased ability of our employees or employees of our customers and partners to work and travel.\nOur inability to overcome these obstacles could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Even if we are successful in managing these obstacles, our partners internationally are subject to these same risks and may not be able to manage these obstacles effectively.\nIn addition, future imposition of, or significant increases in, the level of customs duties, export quotas, regulatory restrictions, trade restrictions or trade prohibitions could materially harm our business.\nEnhanced international tariffs, including tariffs imposed by the United States and China that affect our products or components within our products, other trade barriers or a global trade war could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nOur global business could be negatively affected by trade barriers and other governmental protectionist measures, any of which can be imposed suddenly and unpredictably. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs.\nSince the beginning of 2018, there has been increasing public threats and, in some cases, legislative or executive action, from U.S. and foreign leaders regarding instituting tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials. During the last half of calendar year 2018, the federal government imposed a series of tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on a variety of imports from China. These tariffs affect certain components, including the linear accelerator for our CyberKnife platforms, which we manufacture in China and import into the U.S., as well as other components that we import into the U.S. from our suppliers. China has responded to these tariffs with retaliatory tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on a wide range of products from the U.S., which include certain of our products. Higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by the U.S. and Chinese leaders. Although the U.S. and China signed an initial trade deal in January 2020 and China announced a one year tariff exemption for medical linear accelerators in September 2019 (which was further extended through the end of September 2021), there has been a change in the U.S. presidential administration and, for that, and other reasons, there is no assurance that the trade deal will be signed or that the exemption on medical linear accelerators will continue beyond the extended term or that we will continue to qualify for such exemption. If these tariffs continue, if additional tariffs are placed on certain of our components or products, or if any related counter-measures are taken by China, the U.S. or other countries, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed. The imposition of tariffs could also increase our costs and require us to raise prices on our products, which may negatively impact the demand for our products in the affected market. If we are not successful in offsetting the impact of any such tariffs, our revenue, gross margins and operating results may be adversely affected.\nThese tariffs are subject to a number of uncertainties as they are implemented, including future adjustments and changes. The ultimate reaction of other countries and the impact of these tariffs or other actions on the U.S., China, the global economy and our business, financial condition and results of operations, cannot be predicted at this time, nor can we predict the impact of any other developments with respect to global trade. Further, the imposition of additional tariffs by the U.S. could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by China and other countries, as well as further retaliatory actions by any affected country. Any resulting trade war could negatively impact the global market for medical devices, including radiation therapy devices, and could have a significant adverse effect on our business. These developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and they may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between China and the U.S. Any of these factors could depress economic activity, restrict our access to customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to the current global economic environment, including risks arising in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by, among other things, delaying or preventing our customers from obtaining financing to purchase the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and implement the required facilities to house our systems.\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global markets and the economy generally. Concerns over economic and political stability, the availability of fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of U.S. national debt, currency fluctuations and volatility; the rate of growth of Japan, China and other Asian economies, unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, inflation levels, trade relations, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, energy costs and geopolitical uncertainty have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets.\nFurther, the U.S. federal government has called for, or enacted, substantial changes to healthcare, trade, fiscal, and tax policies, which may include changes to existing trade agreements and may have a significant impact on our operations. For example, the Trump administration initiated the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign products, including from China, that have resulted in and may result in future retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and products. While there has been a change in the U.S. presidential administration, we cannot predict whether these policies will continue, or if new policies will be enacted, or the impact, if any, that any policy changes could have on our business. If economic conditions worsen or new legislation is passed related to the healthcare system, trade, fiscal or tax policies, customer demand may not materialize to levels we require to achieve our anticipated financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, uncertain credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit, including concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors, including financial institutions. If the current situation deteriorates or does not improve, our business could be negatively affected by factors such as reduced demand for our products resulting from a slow-down or volatility in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers, and delays associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the United States, some of our customers have been delayed in obtaining, or have not been able to obtain, necessary financing for their purchases of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms. In addition, some of our customers have been delayed in obtaining, or have not been able to obtain, necessary financing for the construction or renovation of facilities to house CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, the cost of which can be substantial. These delays have in some instances led to our customers postponing the shipment and installation of previously ordered systems or cancelling their system orders, and may cause other customers to postpone their system installation or to cancel their agreements with us. An increase in delays and order cancellations of this nature would adversely affect our product sales, backlog and revenues, and therefore harm our business and results of operations. In addition, the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, has caused, and may continue to cause, uncertainty in the global markets. The risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed in more detail in our risk factor entitled \u201cThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the perception of its effects, on our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\u201d The risks related to Brexit are discussed in more detail in our risk factor entitled \u201cThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our operations.\u201d\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our operations.\nOn January 31, 2020, the UK formally withdrew from the EU and entered into a new trade agreement with the EU that took effect on January 1, 2021. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the EU.\nBrexit has caused, and may continue to cause, uncertainty in the global markets. The effects of Brexit will also depend on any additional agreements the UK reaches to retain access to EU markets. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the UK determines which EU laws to replace, including those governing manufacturing, labor, environmental, data protection/privacy, competition, medical sales and advertising and other matters applicable to the medical device industry. In addition, as a result of Brexit, the movement of goods between the UK and the remaining member states of the EU will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. Moreover, currency volatility could drive a weaker pound which could result in a decrease in the profitability of our sales in the UK. Any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of Brexit could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete.\nWhile we have not experienced any material financial impact from Brexit on sales within the UK to date, we cannot predict its future implications. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU and full implementation of a new trade agreement could result in changes that impact our business. For example, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (\u201cMHRA\u201d) established new UK regulations for medical devices whereby the UK will continue to accept the CE mark through June 30, 2023 and thereafter, the UK will require its own product registration and UK Conformity Assessed (\u201cUKCA\u201d) mark to be placed on medical devices sold in the UK market, including our products. Any impact from Brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, tax treaties, trade, regulatory and other negotiations the UK conducts as well as its enactment, interpretation and enforcement of new laws and regulations, such as the UK Data Protection Act, which substantially implements the GDPR in the UK, and other UK data protection laws or regulations that may develop in the medium to longer term, affecting matters such as data transfers to and from the UK. We continue to monitor and review the impact of any resulting changes to EU or UK law that could affect our operations.\nIf we encounter manufacturing problems, or if our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal, state or foreign manufacturing standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations, which would result in delays and lost revenue.\nThe CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms are complex and require the integration of a number of components from several sources of supply. We must manufacture and assemble these complex systems in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. Our linear accelerator components are extremely complex devices and require significant expertise to manufacture, and we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, including problems with quality control and assurance, component supply shortages, increased costs, shortages of qualified personnel, the long lead time required to develop additional radiation-shielded facilities for purposes of testing our products and/or difficulties associated with compliance with local, state, federal and foreign regulatory requirements. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to impact the supply of key components such that we may not receive them in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities, or at reasonable cost. We may also experience limitations in the availability of qualified personnel as a result of shelter-in-place rules, quarantine requirements, or illness. If our manufacturing capacity does not keep pace with product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which in turn may have a negative effect on our financial results and overall business. Conversely, if demand for our products decreases, the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur manufacturing processes and the manufacturing processes of our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d) for any products imported into, or sold within, the U.S. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production process and controls, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. Furthermore, we are required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality requirements. We are also subject to state licensing and other requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices, and we are required to comply with International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d), quality system standards in order to produce products for sale in Europe and Canada, as well as various other foreign laws and regulations. Because our manufacturing processes include the production of diagnostic and therapeutic X-ray equipment and laser equipment, we are subject to the electronic product radiation control provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which requires that we file reports with the FDA, applicable states and our customers regarding the distribution, manufacturing and installation of these types of equipment. The FDA enforces the QSR and the electronic product radiation control provisions through periodic inspections, some of which may be unannounced. We have been, and anticipate in the future being subject to such\ninspections. FDA inspections usually occur every two to three years. During such inspections, the FDA may issue Inspectional Observations on Form FDA 483, listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and procedures, or warning letters.\nIf a manufacturer does not adequately address the observations, the FDA may take enforcement action against the manufacturer, including the imposition of fines, restriction of the ability to export product, total shutdown of production facilities and criminal prosecution. If we or a third-party supplier receive a Form FDA 483 with material or major observations that are not promptly corrected, fail to pass a QSR inspection, or fail to comply with these, ISO and other applicable regulatory requirements, our operations could be disrupted and our ability to generate sales could be delayed. Our failure to take prompt and satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or our failure to comply with applicable standards could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our products, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, which would cause our sales and business to suffer. In addition, because some foreign regulatory approvals are based on approvals or clearances from the FDA, any failure to comply with FDA requirements may also disrupt our sales of products in other countries. We cannot assure you that the FDA or other governmental authorities would agree with our interpretation of applicable regulatory requirements or that we or our third-party suppliers have in all instances fully complied with all applicable requirements. If any of these events occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could lose customers and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot achieve the required level and quality of production, we may need to outsource production or rely on licensing and other arrangements with third parties who possess sufficient manufacturing facilities and capabilities in compliance with regulatory requirements. Even if we could outsource needed production or enter into licensing or other third-party arrangements, this could reduce our gross margin and expose us to the risks inherent in relying on others. We also cannot assure you that our suppliers will deliver an adequate supply of required components on a timely basis or that they will adequately comply with the QSR. Failure to obtain these components on a timely basis would disrupt our manufacturing processes and increase our costs, which would harm our operating results.\nIf we are unable to develop new products or enhance existing products to meet our customers\u2019 needs and compete favorably in the market, we may be unable to attract or retain customers.\nOur success depends on the successful development, regulatory clearance or approval, introduction and commercialization of new generations of products, treatment systems, and enhancements to and/or simplification of existing products that will meet our customers\u2019 needs provide novel features and compete favorably in the market. The CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, which are currently our principal products, are technologically complex and must keep pace with, among other things, the products of our competitors and new technologies. We are making significant investments in long-term growth initiatives. Such initiatives require significant capital commitments, involvement of senior management and other investments on our part, which we may be unable to recover. Our timeline for the development of new products or enhancements may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Commercialization of new products may prove challenging, and we may be required to invest more time and money than expected to successfully introduce them. Once introduced, new products may adversely impact orders and sales of our existing products, or make them less desirable or even obsolete. Compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of new products or enhancements. Our inability to develop, gain regulatory approval for or supply competitive products to the market as quickly and effectively as our competitors could limit market acceptance of our products and reduce our sales.\nOur ability to successfully develop and introduce new products, treatment systems and product enhancements and simplifications, and the revenues and costs associated with these efforts, will be affected by our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and address customer needs;\n\u2022\nprove feasibility of new products in a timely manner;\n\u2022\neducate physicians about the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022\ncomply with internal quality assurance systems and processes timely and efficiently;\n\u2022\nmanage the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances;\n\u2022\naccurately predict and control costs associated with inventory overruns caused by phase-in of new products and phase-out of old products;\n\u2022\nprice new products competitively;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time and accurately predict and control costs associated with manufacturing, installation, warranty and maintenance of the products;\n\u2022\nmeet our product development plan and launch timelines;\n\u2022\nimprove manufacturing yields of components; and\n\u2022\nmanage customer demands for retrofits of both old and new products.\nEven if customers accept new products or product enhancements, the revenues from these products may not be sufficient to offset the significant costs associated with making them available to customers.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval or clearance for, manufacture or introduce new products, treatment systems or enhancements, the roll-out of which involves compliance with complex quality assurance processes, including QSR. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or clearance for our products or to complete these processes in a timely and efficient manner could result in delays that could affect our ability to attract and retain customers, or could cause customers to delay or cancel orders, causing our backlog, revenues and operating results to suffer.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth, our business may be significantly harmed.\nIn order to implement our business strategy, we expect continued growth in our infrastructure requirements, particularly as we expand into new and growing markets as well as expand our manufacturing capacities and sales and marketing capabilities. To manage our growth, we must expand our facilities, augment our management, operational and financial systems, hire and train additional qualified personnel, scale-up our manufacturing capacity and expand our marketing and distribution capabilities, all of which will be more difficult to accomplish the longer that our employees must work remotely from home. Our manufacturing, assembly and installation process is complex and occurs over many months and we must effectively scale this entire process to satisfy customer expectations and changes in demand. Further, to accommodate our growth and compete effectively, we will be required to make improvements to our business operations. We cannot be certain that our personnel, systems, procedures and internal controls will be adequate to support our future operations and any expansion of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit significant additional financial, operational and management resources. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business will suffer.\nWe could become subject to product liability claims, product recalls, other field actions and warranty claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the manufacturing, marketing, sale, installation, servicing, and support of medical device products. We may be held liable if one of our CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms or our Precision Treatment Planning with iDMS Data Management System software causes or contributes to injury or death or is found otherwise unsuitable during usage. Our products incorporate sophisticated components and computer software. Complex software can contain errors, particularly when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after installation. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical and therapeutic procedures involving delivery of radiation to the body, defects, even if small, could result in a number of complications, some of which could be serious and could harm or kill patients. Any alleged weaknesses in physician training and services associated with our products may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes and product liability lawsuits. It is also possible that defects in the design, manufacture or labeling of our products might necessitate a product recall or other field corrective action, which may result in warranty claims beyond our expectations and may harm our reputation and create adverse publicity. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs that may not be covered by\ninsurance and be time-consuming to defend. We may also be subject to claims for personal injury, property damage or economic loss related to, or resulting from, any errors or defects in our products, or the installation, servicing and support of our products, or any professional services rendered in conjunction with our products. Adverse publicity related to any product liability actions may cause patients to be less receptive to radiation therapy generally or our products specifically and could also result in additional regulation that could adversely affect our ability to promote, manufacture and sell our products. The coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover future claims. If sales of our products increase or we suffer future product liability claims, we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or with adequate amounts of coverage. A product liability claim, any product recalls or other field actions or excessive warranty claims, whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or labeling, could negatively affect our sales or require a change in the design, manufacturing process or the indications for which our systems or software may be used, any of which could harm our reputation and business and result in a decline in revenue.\nIn addition, if a product we designed or manufactured is defective, whether because of design or manufacturing, supplied parts, or labeling defects, improper use of the product or other reasons, we may be required to notify regulatory authorities and/or to recall the product, possibly at our expense. We have voluntarily initiated recalls and other product corrections in the past. In fiscal year 2021, we voluntarily initiated one recall related to the TomoTherapy platform and one recall on the CyberKnife platform both of which were reported to the FDA We are committed to the safety and precision of our products and while no serious adverse health consequences have been reported in connection with these recalls and the costs associated with each such recall were not material, we cannot ensure that the FDA will not require that we take additional actions to address problems that resulted in previous recalls or that similar or more significant product recalls will not occur in the future. A required notification of a correction or removal to a regulatory authority or recall could result in an investigation by regulatory authorities of our products, which could in turn result in required recalls, restrictions on the sale of the products or other civil or criminal penalties. The adverse publicity resulting from any of these actions could cause customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us. These investigations, corrections or recalls, especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity, patient injury or termination of customer contracts, could result in incurring substantial costs, losing revenues and damaging our reputation, each of which would harm our business.\nOur reliance on single-source suppliers for critical components of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely and cost effective manner.\nWe currently depend on single-source suppliers for some of the critical components necessary to assemble the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, including, with respect to the CyberKnife platform, the robot, couch and magnetron and, with respect to the TomoTherapy platforms, the couch, solid state modulator and magnetron. If these suppliers were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us, or if these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or other problems that prevented them from supplying us with the necessary components, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These sole source and other suppliers could also be subject to quality and performance issues, materials shortages, excess demand, reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us; thereby adversely affecting our business and customer relationships. If any single-source supplier was to cease delivering components to us or fail to provide the components to our specifications and on a timely basis, we might be required to find alternative sources for these components. The disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components, which could affect our results of operations. In some cases, alternative suppliers may be located in the same geographic area as existing suppliers, and are thus subject to the same economic, political and geographic factors that may affect existing suppliers to meet our demand. We may have difficulty or be unable to find alternative sources for these components. As a result, we may be unable to meet the demand for the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, which could harm our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation. Even if we do find alternate suppliers, we will be required to qualify any such alternate suppliers and we would likely experience a lengthy delay in our manufacturing processes or a cessation in production, which would result in delays of shipment to end users. We cannot assure you that our single-source suppliers will be able or willing to meet our future demands.\nWe generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory, which makes us even more susceptible to harm if a single-source supplier fails to deliver components on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a critical component of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality and applicable regulatory requirements and guidelines, which could further impede our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner. If the change in manufacturer results in a significant change to the product, a new 510(k) clearance would be necessary, which would likely cause substantial delays. In addition, we have experienced\ndelays in obtaining components and materials from suppliers as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruption or termination of the supply of key components for the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms could harm our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget, harm our ability to generate revenue, lead to customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nFailures of components also affect the reliability and performance of our products, can reduce customer confidence in our products, and may adversely affect our financial performance. From time to time, we may receive components that do not perform according to their specifications, which could result in the inability of such customer utilize our systems in their practices until such components are replaced. Any future difficulty in obtaining reliable component parts could result in increased customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to protect and retain our installed base of customers and results of operations.\nWe depend on key employees, the loss of whom would adversely affect our business. If we fail to attract and retain employees with the expertise required for our business, we may be unable to continue to grow our business.\nWe are highly dependent on the members of our senior management, sales, marketing, operations and research and development staff. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to retain our key employees and to identify, hire and retain additional personnel. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may interfere with our ability to hire or retain personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the medical device industry is intense and finding and retaining qualified personnel with experience in our industry is very difficult. We believe there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills to serve in many of our key positions and we face significant competition for key personnel and other employees, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located, from other medical equipment and software manufacturers, technology companies, universities and research institutions. As a result, we may not be able to retain our existing employees or hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. Moreover, we have in the past conducted reductions in force in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs, and certain senior personnel have also departed for various reasons. At the same time, we may face high turnover, requiring us to expend time and resources to source, train and integrate new employees. The challenging markets in which we compete for talent may also require us to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain employees. In addition, a significant portion of our compensation to our key employees is in the form of stock related grants. A prolonged depression in our stock price could make it difficult for us to retain our key and other employees and recruit additional qualified personnel and we may have to pay additional compensation to employees to incentivize them to join or stay with us. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers and partners, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. We do not maintain, and do not currently intend to obtain, key employee life insurance on any of our personnel. If we fail to hire and retain key personnel and other employees, we may be unable to continue to grow our business successfully.\nDisruption of critical information technology systems, infrastructure and data or cyberattacks or other security breaches or incidents could harm our business and financial condition.\nInformation technology helps us operate more efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and secure the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions or the loss, unavailability of or damage to intellectual property through a cyberattack (including ransomware and other attacks) or other security breach or incident. Regardless of the resources we allocate and the effectiveness with which we manage them, we face a risk of cyberattacks and other security breaches and incidents. Any cyberattacks or other security breaches or incidents we suffer could expose us to a risk of lost or corrupted information, unavailability of information, unauthorized disclosure of information, claims, litigation and possible liability to employees, customers and others, and investigations and proceedings by regulatory authorities. In addition, we have moved some of our data and information to a cloud computing system, where applications and data are hosted, accessed and processed through a third party provider over a broadband internet connection. Consequently, we are dependent on the security measures of the provider of this cloud computing system, and we may also utilize third-party providers for other services such as human resources, electronic communications and financial functions. There have been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers\u2019 systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our platform. Further, we could be subject to outages, cyberattacks, and other security breaches and\nincidents suffered by the third party service provider. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, more of our personnel and the personnel of our service providers are working remotely, which increases the risks of security breaches and cyberattacks.\nIf our data management systems or those of our third-party providers do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, catastrophic events or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we internally and externally report our operating results. As a result, our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, continuing our efforts to build security into the design of our products, protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future, or that we will not suffer from disruptions or other systems issues even if we devote substantial resources and personnel to these efforts.\nIn addition, data privacy breaches and incidents arising from errors, malfeasance or misconduct by employees, contractors or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including individually identifiable data, may be exposed to unauthorized person or to the public and may compromise our security systems. There can be no assurance that any efforts we make to prevent against such data privacy breaches or incidents will prevent breakdowns or breaches or incidents in our systems or those of our third-party service providers that could adversely affect our business. Third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. For example, our employees have received in the past and likely will continue to receive \u201cphishing\u201d e-mails attempting to induce them to divulge sensitive information. In addition, unauthorized persons may attempt to hack into our products or systems to obtain personal data relating to patients or employees, our confidential or proprietary information or confidential information we hold on behalf of third parties, which, if successful, could pose a risk of loss, unavailability, or corruption of, or unauthorized access to or acquisition of, data, risk to patient safety and risk of product recall. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to our systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may not be able to anticipate and prevent these intrusions or mitigate them when they occur. Third-party service providers store and otherwise process certain personal data and other confidential or proprietary information of ourselves and third parties on our behalf, and these service providers face similar risks. Moreover, we manufacture and sell hardware and software products that allow our customers to store confidential information about their patients. Both types of products are often connected to and reside within our customers\u2019 information technology infrastructures. We do not have measures to configure or secure our customers\u2019 equipment or any information stored in our customers\u2019 systems or at their locations, which is the responsibility of our customers. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect our hardware and software products from unauthorized access and cyberattacks, these measures may not be effective in securing these products, particularly since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target. A breach of network security or systems of ourselves or our third-party service providers or other events that cause the loss or unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access by third parties to, sensitive information stored by us or our customers, or the perception that any of these have occurred, could have serious negative consequences for our business, including loss of information, indemnity obligations, possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our products and services, an unwillingness of our customers to use our products or services, harm to our reputation and brand, and time-consuming and expensive litigation, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with legal or regulatory requirements related to privacy, cyber security and data protection in one or multiple jurisdictions could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us.\nThere are numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, decisions and directives regarding privacy and the collection, storage, transmission, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other personal, customer or other data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing\ninterpretations. Our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to privacy, cyber security and data protection laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, and that some of the data we process, store and transmit may be transmitted across countries. For example, in the U.S., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) privacy and security rules require us as a business associate to protect the confidentiality of patient health information, and the Federal Trade Commission has consumer protection authority, including regarding privacy and cyber security. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data that will increase our obligations and, in the event of violations, may impose significant fines of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide annual revenue or \u20ac20 million. In the UK, the Data Protection Act of 2018 and the UK GDPR, which collectively implement material provisions of the GDPR and provide for penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million or four percent of worldwide revenues.\nData transfer and localization requirements related to personally identifiable information also appear to be increasing and becoming more complex. With regard to transfers to the U.S. of personal data (as such term is used in the GDPR and applicable EU member state legislation, and as similarly defined under the proposed ePrivacy Regulation) from our employees and European customers and users, both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and EU Model Clauses have been subject to legal challenge. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) released a decision in the Schrems II case (Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland, Schrems) (the \u201cCJEU Decision\u201d), declaring the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield invalid and imposing additional obligations in connection with the use of another mechanism for cross-border personal data transfers from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). Although the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission (the \u201cSCCs\u201d) remain a valid means to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), the CJEU imposed additional obligations in connection with the use of the Standard Contractual Clauses. The CJEU Decision, the revised SCCs, regulatory guidance and opinions, and other developments relating to cross-border data transfer may require us to implement additional contractual and technical safeguards for any personal data transferred out of the EEA, which may increase compliance costs, lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or liability, may require additional contractual negotiations, and may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChina and Russia have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. The current U.S. administration is engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of national security concerns and other risks relating to the transfer of personally identifiable information from the United States to China, and on June 9, 2021, U.S. President Joseph Biden signed an executive order instituting a framework for determining national security risks of transactions that involve applications connected to governments or militaries of certain foreign adversaries or that collect sensitive personal data from U.S. consumers. In 2019, an executive order citing national security risks in the telecommunications sector served to block U.S. companies from buying Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE products. If our operations, including those involving the processing of U.S.-collected data such as medical imagery, through the JV in China, come to be perceived as a U.S. national security risk, those operations may become subject to executive orders, sanctions, or other measures. Any ban or other restriction on our transfer of data to the JV in China may increase costs as we seek operational and data processing alternatives.\nNew and proposed privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection laws are also providing new rights to individuals and increasing the penalties associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act, imposes stringent data privacy and data protection requirements for the data of California residents, and provides for penalties for noncompliance of up to $7,500 per violation, as well as a private right of action from individuals in relation to certain security breaches.\nAdditionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), was approved by California voters in November 2020. The CPRA creates obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA and anticipate additional costs and expenses associated with CPRA compliance. The enactment of the CCPA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other states in the U.S., which could create the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. For example, in March 2021, Virginia enacted a Consumer Data Protection Act that will go into effect January 1, 2023, and on June 8, 2021, Colorado enacted a Colorado Privacy Act that takes effect on July 1, 2023. These new state laws share similarities with the CCPA, CPRA, and legislation proposed in other states. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA, CPRA, or other new or proposed legislation on our business or operations, but the restrictions imposed by these laws and regulations may limit the\nuse and adoption of our products, reduce overall demand for our products, require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional costs and burdens, including risks of regulatory fines, litigation and associated reputational harm. In addition, U.S. and international laws that have been applied to protect user privacy (including laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices in the U.S. and GDPR in the EU) may be subject to evolving interpretations or applications in light of privacy developments. As a result, we may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties and fines, for any failure to comply with such laws, regulations and directives.\nPrivacy, cyber security and data protection legislation around the world is comprehensive and complex and there has been a recent trend towards more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services, reduce overall demand for our products and services, require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional costs and burdens. With increasing enforcement of privacy, cyber security and data protection laws and regulations, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to enforcement actions by governmental bodies or that our costs of compliance will not increase significantly. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies. While we have not been named in any such suits, if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur, we could become a target of such litigation. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines and public censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf third-party payors do not provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement to healthcare providers for use of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms or if the number of patients covered by health insurance reduces, demand for our products and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nOur customers rely significantly on reimbursement from public and private third-party payors for CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platform procedures. Our ability to commercialize our products successfully and increase market acceptance of our products will depend in significant part on the extent to which public and private third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures that are performed with our products and the extent to which patients that are treated by our products continue to be covered by health insurance. Third-party payors may establish or change the reimbursement for medical products and services that could significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services. In addition, actions by the government, downturns in the economy and other factors outside of our control could negatively affect the number of individuals covered by health insurance. For example, in connection with COVID-19-related layoffs, many individuals have lost their employer-covered health insurance and there is uncertainty as to when or if such coverage will be re-established. If reimbursement policies or other cost containment measures are instituted in a manner that significantly reduces the coverage or payment for the procedures that are performed with our products or if there is a prolonged reduction in the number of patients eligible to be treated by our products that are covered by health insurance, our revenue may decline, our existing customers may not continue using our products or may decrease their use of our products, and we may have difficulty obtaining new customers. Such actions would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) reviews reimbursement rates annually and may implement significant changes in future years, which could discourage existing and potential customers from purchasing or using our products. Further, outside of the U.S., reimbursement practices vary significantly by country. Market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of coverage and reimbursement in any country within a particular time.\nThe safety and efficacy of our products for certain uses is not yet supported by long-term clinical data, and our products may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought.\nAlthough we believe that the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms have advantages over competing products and technologies, we do not have sufficient clinical data demonstrating these advantages for all tumor indications. In\naddition, we have only limited five-year patient survival rate data, which is a common long-term measure of clinical effectiveness in cancer treatment. We also have limited clinical data directly comparing the effectiveness of the CyberKnife platform to other competing platforms. Future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with the CyberKnife platform does not improve patient survival or outcomes.\nLikewise, because the TomoTherapy platform have only been on the market since 2003, we have limited complication or patient survival rate data with respect to treatment using the systems. In addition, while the effectiveness of radiation therapy is well understood, there is a growing but still limited number of peer-reviewed medical journal publications regarding the efficacy of highly conformal treatment such as that delivered by the TomoTherapy platform. If future patient studies or clinical experience do not support our beliefs that the TomoTherapy platform offer a more advantageous treatment for a wide variety of cancer types, use of the systems could fail to increase or could decrease, and our business would therefore be adversely affected.\nSuch results could reduce the rate of reimbursement by both public and private third-party payors for procedures that are performed with our products, slow the adoption of our products by physicians, significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues and could prevent us from being profitable. In addition, if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, the FDA could rescind our clearances, our reputation with physicians, patients and others may suffer and we could be subject to significant legal liability.\nWe rely on third parties to perform spare parts shipping and other logistics functions on our behalf. A failure or disruption at our logistics providers would adversely impact our business.\nCustomer service is a critical element of our sales strategy. Third-party logistics providers store most of our spare parts inventory in depots around the world and perform a significant portion of our spare parts logistics and shipping activities. If any of our logistics providers terminates its relationship with us, suffers an interruption in its business, including as a result of COVID-19, significantly increases fees for services or experiences delays, disruptions or quality control problems in its operations, or we have to change and qualify alternative logistics providers for our spare parts, shipments of spare parts to our customers may be delayed or at a higher cost and our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our product.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, the field of radiation treatment of cancer is well established and crowded with the intellectual property of competitors and others. We also expect that other participants will enter the field. A number of companies in our market, as well as universities and research institutions, have issued patents and have filed patent applications that relate to the use of radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery to treat cancerous and benign tumors.\nDetermining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of patent litigation actions is often uncertain. We have not conducted an extensive search of patents issued to third parties, and no assurance can be given that third-party patents containing claims covering our products, parts of our products, technology or methods do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued. Because of the number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our technical areas or fields, our competitors or other third parties may assert that our products and the methods we employ in the use of our products are covered by U.S. or foreign patents held by them.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue and because publication schedules for pending applications vary by jurisdiction, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware, and which may result in issued patents that our current or future products infringe. Also, because the claims of published patent applications can change between publication and patent grant, there may be published patent applications that may ultimately issue with claims that we infringe. There could also be existing patents that one or more of our products or parts may infringe and of which we are unaware. As the number of competitors in the market for less invasive cancer treatment alternatives grows, and as the number of patents issued in this area grows, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases. Regardless of the merit of infringement claims, they can be\ntime-consuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise funds, if necessary, to continue our operations.\nIn the event that we become subject to a patent infringement or other intellectual property lawsuit and if the relevant patents or other intellectual property were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe or violate the terms of a license to which we are a party, we could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign the product to avoid infringement. Required licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain a license or successfully redesign our system, we might be prevented from selling such system. If there is an allegation or determination that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a competitor or other person, we may be required to pay damages, pay ongoing royalties or otherwise settle such matter upon terms that are unfavorable to us. In these circumstances, we may be unable to sell our products at competitive prices or at all, and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the medical device industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical equipment or biotechnology companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that we or those employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against claims of this nature, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. Patents and other proprietary rights provide uncertain protections, and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property. For example, we may be unsuccessful in defending our patents and other proprietary rights against third-party challenges. As key patents expire, our ability to prevent competitors from copying our technology may be limited. In addition, patent reform legislation or precedent could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products, including in case of a security breach involving our intellectual property. If these measures do not protect our rights adequately, third parties could use our technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. Although we have attempted to obtain patent coverage for our technology where available and appropriate, there are aspects of the technology for which patent coverage was never sought or never received. There also may be countries in which we sell or intend to sell the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms but have no patents or pending patent applications. Our ability to prevent others from making or selling duplicate or similar technologies will be impaired in those countries in which we have no patent protection. Although we have several issued patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries protecting aspects of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, our pending U.S. and foreign patent applications may not issue, may issue only with limited coverage or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and held invalid or unenforceable. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nSimilarly, our issued patents and those of our licensors may not provide us with any competitive advantages. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products which provide outcomes comparable or\nsuperior to ours. Our patents may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties, and others may challenge the inventorship or ownership of our patents and pending patent applications. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries, such as China where the JV operates, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and, even if they do, uneven enforcement and procedural barriers may exist in such countries. In the event a competitor or other third party infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights or otherwise misappropriates such rights, enforcing those rights may be difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business. Damage awards resulting from successful litigation in foreign jurisdictions may not be in amounts commensurate with damage awards in the U.S. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge. In addition, we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us.\nWe also license patent and other proprietary rights to aspects of our technology to third parties in fields where we currently do not operate as well as in fields where we currently do operate. Disputes with our licensees may arise regarding the scope and content of these licenses. Further, our ability to expand into additional fields with our technologies may be restricted by our existing licenses or licenses we may grant to third parties in the future.\nAdditionally, we have written agreements with collaborators regarding the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. These agreements generally provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights with collaborators with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our collaborators that arise from the results of the collaboration. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the resolution of intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party collaborator\u2019s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator\u2019s technology, we may be limited in our ability to utilize these intellectual property rights. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could harm our business.\nThe policies and procedures we have in place to protect our trade secrets may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our trade secrets by others. In addition, confidentiality agreements executed by our employees, consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Litigating a trade secret claim is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge methods and know-how. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to prevent competitors from using our own inventions and intellectual property to compete against us and our business may be harmed.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are and may become a party to legal proceedings, claims and other legal matters in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. These legal proceedings, claims and other legal matters, regardless of merit, may be costly, time-consuming and require the attention of key management and other personnel. The outcomes of such matters are uncertain and difficult to predict. If any such matters are adjudicated against us, in whole or in part, we may be subject to substantial monetary damages, disgorgement of profits and injunctions that prevent us from operating our business, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. We cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any damages awarded against us. Further, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business.\nBecause the majority of our product revenue is derived from sales of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, which have a long and variable sales and installation cycle, our revenues and cash flows may be volatile and difficult to predict.\nOur primary products are the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms. We expect to generate substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future from sales of and service contracts for the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms. The CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms have lengthy sales and purchase order cycles because they are major capital equipment items and require the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions. In addition, sales to some of our customers are subject to competitive bidding or public tender processes. These approval and bidding processes can be lengthy. Selling our systems, from first contact with a potential customer to a complete order, generally spans six months to two years and involves personnel with multiple skills. The sales process in the U.S. typically begins with pre-selling activity followed by sales presentations and other sales related activities. After the customer has expressed an intention to purchase a CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform, we negotiate and enter into a definitive purchase contract with the customer. The negotiation of terms that are not standard for Accuray may require additional time and approvals. Typically, following the execution of the contract, the customer begins the building or renovation of a radiation-shielded facility to house the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform, which together with the subsequent installation of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform, can take up to 24 months to complete. In order to construct this facility, the customer must typically obtain radiation device installation permits, which are granted by state and local government bodies, each of which may have different criteria for permit issuance. If a permit was denied for installation at a specific hospital or treatment center, our CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform could not be installed at that location. In addition, some of our customers are cancer centers or facilities that are new, and in these cases, it may be necessary for the entire facility to be completed before the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform can be installed, which can result in additional construction and installation delays. Our sales and installations of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms tend to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter.\nUnder our revenue recognition policy, we recognize revenue attributable to a CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform and related upgrades when control of a platform or upgrade is transferred, which generally happens when a system or upgrade is shipped, while an element of installation is deferred until performed. Events beyond our control may delay shipment or installation and the satisfaction of contingencies required to receive cash inflows and recognition of revenue associated with shipment or installation. Such events may include a delay in the construction at the customer site or customer delay in obtaining receipt of regulatory approvals such as certificates of need. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption to their operations, certain customers have experienced delays in construction, shipment or installation and some have failed to timely pay their obligations when due. If the events which are beyond our control delay the customer from obtaining funding or financing of the entire transaction, we may not be able to recognize revenue for the sale of the entire system because the collectability of contract consideration is not reasonably assured.\nThe long sales cycle, together with delays in the shipment of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms or customer cancellations that could affect our ability to recognize revenue, could adversely affect our cash flows and revenue, which would harm our results of operations and may result in significant fluctuations in our reporting of quarterly revenues. As a result of these fluctuations, it is likely that in some future quarters, our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance.\nWe depend on third-party distributors to market and distribute our products in international markets. If our distributors fail to successfully market and distribute our products, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe depend on a number of distributors in our international markets. We cannot control the efforts and resources our third-party distributors will devote to marketing the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms. Our distributors may not be able to successfully market and sell the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, including as a result of concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts and may not market the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform at prices that will permit the product to develop, achieve or sustain market acceptance. In some jurisdictions, we rely on our distributors to manage the regulatory process and oversee their activities such that they are in compliance with all laws that govern their activities, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and we are dependent on their ability to do so effectively. In addition, if a distributor is terminated by us or goes out of business, it may take us a period of time\nto locate an alternative distributor, to seek appropriate regulatory approvals and to train its personnel to market the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, and our ability to sell and service the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms in the region formerly serviced by such terminated distributor could be materially and adversely affected. Any of our distributors could become insolvent or otherwise become unable to pay amounts owed to us when due. If any of these distributor relationships end and are not replaced, our revenues from product sales or the ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenue from international markets, increase our costs in those markets or damage our reputation. If we are unable to attract additional international distributors, our international revenue may not grow. If our distributors experience difficulties, do not comply with regulatory or legal requirements that results in fines or penalties, do not actively market the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms or do not otherwise perform under our distribution agreements, our potential for revenue from international markets may be dramatically reduced, and our business could be harmed.\nThe high unit price of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, as well as other factors, may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our operating results, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nBecause of the high unit price of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and the relatively small number of units shipped each quarter, each shipment of a CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform can represent a significant percentage of our revenue for a particular quarter. Therefore, if we do not ship a CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform when anticipated, we will not be able to recognize the associated revenue and our operating results will vary significantly from our expectations. This is of particular concern when the economic environment is volatile, such as the current economic environment. For example, during periods of severe economic volatility, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had customers cancel or postpone orders for our CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and delaying any required build-outs. These fluctuations and other potential fluctuations mean that you should not rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance.\nAs a strategy to assist our sales efforts, we may offer extended payment terms, which may potentially result in higher days sales outstanding, reduced cash flows in a particular period and greater payment defaults.\nWe offer longer or extended payment terms for qualified customers in some circumstances. As of June 30, 2021, customer contracts with extended payment terms of more than one year amounted to approximately 4% of our total accounts receivable balance. While we qualify customers to whom we offer longer or extended payment terms, their financial positions may change adversely over the longer time period given for payment. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to the operations of our customers, we have experienced and may continue to experience increased requests by our customers for extended payment terms as well as temporary suspensions of service and the corresponding payment obligations. This may result in an increase in payment defaults, which would negatively affect our revenue. In addition, any increase in days sales outstanding could also negatively affect our cash flow.\nWe may attempt to acquire new businesses, products or technologies, or enter into strategic collaborations or alliances, including forming joint ventures, and if we are unable to successfully complete these acquisitions or to integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or employees, we may fail to realize expected benefits or harm our existing business.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies or through collaborating with complementary businesses, including forming joint ventures, such as the JV, rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition, alliance and joint venture partner candidates can be difficult, time consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures. Other companies may compete with us for these strategic opportunities. In addition, even if we successfully complete an acquisition, alliance or joint venture, we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations, products or technologies into our operations or timely and effectively commence operations of any joint venture or other alliance because the process of integration could be expensive, time consuming and may strain our resources. Furthermore, we may be required to contribute significant amounts of capital or incur losses in the initial stages of an alliance or joint venture, particularly as selling and marketing\nactivities increase ahead of expected long-term revenue. For example, we completed our capital contributions to the JV in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and one system upgrade in the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Further contributions may be necessary in the future as the joint venture expands its operations in China in order to achieve our long-term strategy in China. In addition, the process for customers of the acquired company, alliance or joint venture to comply with local or foreign regulatory requirements that may be required to purchase our products may cause delays in the acquisition target, alliance partner or joint venture\u2019s ability to conduct business. For example, any delays in customers in China to obtain Class A or Class B user licenses or in the subsequent tender process to complete the sale could affect the JV\u2019s expected ability to initiate sales and recognize revenue in China. Furthermore, the products and technologies that we acquire, jointly develop, or with respect to which we collaborate may not be successful, or may require significantly greater resources and investments than we originally anticipated. Implementing or acquiring new lines of business or offering new products and services within existing lines of business can affect the sales and profitability of existing lines of business or products and services, including as a result of sales channel conflicts. In addition, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding any strategic collaboration, alliance or joint venture, which could result in impasses on decisions or decisions made by our partners, and our partners in such collaborations, alliances or joint ventures may have economic or business interests that are, or may become, inconsistent with our interests. Collaborations, alliances and joint ventures can be difficult to manage and may involve significant expense and divert the focus and attention of our management and other key personnel away from our existing businesses. With respect to any acquisition, we may be unable to retain employees of acquired companies, or retain the acquired company\u2019s customers, suppliers, distributors or other partners who are our competitors or who have close relationships with our competitors. In addition, with respect to joint ventures, we may not be able to attract qualified employees, acquire customers or develop reliable supply, distribution or other partnerships. As a result of certain collaborations, alliances and joint ventures we could face potential damage to existing customer relationships or lack of customer acceptance or inability to attract new customers. These risks could be magnified to the extent that any new collaboration, alliance or joint venture would result in a significant increase in operations in developing markets. Future acquisitions or alliances could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or expenses or other charges such as in-process research and development, any of which could harm our business and affect our financial results or cause a reduction in the price of our common stock. Further, acquisition targets, alliance partners and joint ventures may also operate in foreign jurisdictions with laws and regulations with which we have limited familiarity, which could adversely impact our ability to comply with such laws and regulations and may lead to increased litigation risk. Such laws may also offer us inadequate or less intellectual property protection relative to U.S. laws, which may impact our ability, as well as the ability of the acquisition target, alliance partner and joint venture, to safeguard our respective intellectual property from infringement and misappropriation. As a result of these and other factors, we may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition, collaboration, joint venture or strategic alliance or such benefits may not be realized at expected levels or within the expected time period. The failure to successfully consummate such strategic transactions and effectively integrate and execute following such consummation may have an adverse impact on our growth, profitability, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize certain tax loss carryforwards.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had approximately $321.3 million and $132.2 million in federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2025 for federal and 2022 for state purposes. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $24.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively. Such research credits for federal tax purposes and in states other than California will begin to expire starting in 2022, while the California research credits have no expiration date. The Tax Act legislation, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), among other things, includes changes to the rules governing net operating losses. Net operating losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking the net operating losses into account) when utilized in tax years beginning after March 31, 2021. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In addition, utilization of our net operating loss and credit carry forwards is subject to annual limitation due to the application of the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions to us. Future changes in our stock ownership, including future offerings, as well as changes that may be outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nWe are subject to the tax laws of various foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to unanticipated changes and interpretation and could harm our future results.\nThe application of tax laws of various foreign jurisdictions is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing intercompany arrangements including our transfer pricing or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. The application of tax laws can also be subject to conflicting interpretations by tax authorities in the various jurisdictions we operate. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm\u2019s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes.\nOur results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrently, the majority of our international sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could require us to reduce our sales price or make our products less competitive in international markets. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens, it could cause potential delays in orders and we may see our sales decline. Also, if our international sales increase, we may enter into a greater number of transactions denominated in non-U.S. Dollars, which would expose us to foreign currency risks, including changes in currency exchange rates. If we are unable to address these risks and challenges effectively, our international operations may not be successful and our business would be materially harmed.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial results could be impaired. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to protect from fraudulent, illegal, or unauthorized transactions. If we cannot maintain effective controls and provide timely and reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nA failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. This, in turn, could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and our stock price, and we could be subject to stockholder litigation.\nIn addition, it may be difficult to timely determine the effectiveness of our financial reporting systems and internal controls because of the complexity of our financial model. We recognize revenue from a range of transactions including CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platform sales and services. The CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms are complex products that contain both hardware and software elements. The complexity of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and of our financial model used to recognize revenue on such systems requires us to process a greater variety of financial transactions than would be required by a company with a less complex financial model. Accordingly, efforts to timely remediate deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal controls would likely be more challenging for us than they would for a company with a less complex financial model. Furthermore, if we were to find an internal control deficiency or material weakness, we may be required to amend or restate historical financial statements, which would likely have a negative impact on our stock price.\nOur liquidity could be adversely impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nAt June 30, 2021, we had $116.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. The available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and cash invested in money market funds. To date, we have experienced no material realized losses on or lack of access to our invested cash, or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nAt any point in time, we also have funds in our operating accounts that are with third-party financial institutions that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance limits. While we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be\nimpacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or become subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy.\nWhile we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months, the timing and amount of our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the other risk factors described above and below.\nIf our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities or debt securities or obtain other debt financing, which could be difficult or impossible depending on the state of economic and capital markets environments at the time, as well as the state of our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, any sustained disruption in the capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our ability to raise capital. Our debt levels may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We cannot assure that additional financing, if required or desired, will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of our Products and Business\nModifications, upgrades, new indications and future products related to the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy Systems or the Precision Treatment Planning and iDMS Data Management System software may require new FDA 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals and similar licensing or approvals in international markets. Such modifications, or any defects in design, manufacture or labeling may require us to recall or cease marketing the affected systems or software until approvals or clearances are obtained.\nThe CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms as well as the Precision Treatment Planning with iDMS Data Management System software are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by local, state and the federal government, including the FDA. The FDA cleared the latest imaging feature for the Radixact System, ClearRTTM, under K202412 on December 18, 2020. The FDA regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device design, development, testing manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, adverse event reporting, sale, promotion, distribution and shipping. Before a new medical device, or a new intended use or indication or claim for an existing product, can be marketed in the United States, it must first receive either premarket approval or 510(k) clearance from the FDA, unless an exemption exists. Either process can be expensive, lengthy and unpredictable. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to twelve months, but it can last longer. The process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and it generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. Additionally, outside of the United States, our products are subject to clearances and approvals by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA. In order to market our products internationally, we must obtain licenses or approvals from these governmental agencies, which could include local requirements, safety standards, testing or certifications, and can be time consuming, burdensome and uncertain. Despite the time, effort and cost, there can be no assurance that a particular device or a modification of a device will be approved or cleared by the FDA or any foreign governmental agency in a timely fashion, if at all. Even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses of the product, which may limit the market for those products, and how those products can be promoted.\nMedical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. The FDA and other foreign governments also may change their policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of our device, or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared device. We are also subject to medical device reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA and other international governmental agencies if our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury. We also are subject to the QSR in the U.S. and ISO 13485 certification in many international markets, compliance with which is necessary to receive FDA and other international clearances or approvals to market new products and is necessary for us to be able to continue to market a cleared or approved product in the United States or globally. After a product is placed in the market, we are also subject to regulations by the FDA and Federal Trade Commission related to the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure our claims are consistent with our\nregulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate our claims and that our advertising is not false or misleading. Our products are also subject to state regulations and various worldwide laws and regulations.\nA component of our strategy is to continue to upgrade the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms as well as the Precision Treatment Planning with iDMS Data Management System software. Upgrades previously released by us required 510(k) clearance and international registration before we were able to offer them for sale. We expect our future upgrades will similarly require 510(k) clearance or approval; however, future upgrades may be subject to substantially more time-consuming data generation requirements and uncertain premarket approval or clearance processes. If we were required to use the premarket approval process for future products or product modifications, it could delay or prevent release of the proposed products or modifications, which could harm our business.\nThe FDA requires device manufacturers to make their own determination of whether or not a modification requires an approval or clearance; however, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision not to submit for additional approvals or clearances. Any modification to an FDA approved or cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new premarket approval or 510(k) clearance. We cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our decisions not to seek approvals or clearances for particular device modifications or that we will be successful in obtaining premarket approvals or 510(k) clearances for modifications in a timely fashion, if at all.\nWe have obtained 510(k) clearance for the CyberKnife platform for the treatment of conditions anywhere in the body when radiation treatment is indicated, and we have obtained 510(k) clearance for the TomoTherapy platform to be used as integrated systems for the planning and delivery of IMRT for the treatment of cancer. We have made modifications to the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional approvals or clearances. If the FDA disagrees, based on new finalized guidance and requires us to obtain additional premarket approvals or 510(k) clearances for any modifications to the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms and we fail to obtain such approvals or clearances or fail to secure approvals or clearances in a timely manner, we may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing the modified device or to recall such modified device until we obtain FDA approval or clearance and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design, manufacture or labeling. A government mandated recall, or a voluntary recall by us, could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling and user manuals. Any recall could divert management\u2019s attention, cause us to incur significant expenses, generate negative publicity, harm our reputation with customers, negatively affect our future sales and business, require redesign of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform, and harm our operating results. In these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant enforcement action. If any of these events were to occur, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner would be adversely affected, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our operations, the violation of which could result in substantial penalties and harm our business.\nIn addition to regulation by the FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries, our operations are subject to other laws and regulations, such as laws and rules governing interactions with healthcare providers, anti-corruption laws, privacy rules and transparency laws. In order to maintain compliance with these laws and requirements, we must continually keep abreast of any changes or developments to be able to integrate compliance protocols into the development and regulatory documentation of our products. Failure to maintain compliance could result in substantial penalties to us and harm our business.\nLaws and ethical rules governing interactions with healthcare providers. The Medicare and Medicaid \u201canti-kickback\u201d laws, and similar state laws, prohibit soliciting, offering, paying or accepting any payments or other remuneration that is intended to induce any individual or entity to either refer patients to or purchase, lease or order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of, healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such laws impact our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by reducing the types of financial arrangements we may have with our customers, potential customers, marketing consultants and other service providers. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, product loans, education and training programs, physician consulting, research grants and other service arrangements. Many of these laws are broadly drafted and are open to a variety of interpretations, making it difficult to determine with any certainty whether certain arrangements violate such laws, even if statutory safe harbors are available.\nIn addition to such anti-kickback laws, federal and state \u201cfalse claims\u201d laws generally prohibit the knowing filing or causing the filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from government payors. Although we do not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, or through certain other activities, including promoting products for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA.\nWe are also subject to federal and state physician self-referral laws. The federal Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral. Various states have corollary laws to the Stark Law, including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from state to state.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these \u201canti-kickback,\u201d \u201cfalse claims,\u201d \u201cself-referral\u201d or other similar laws in foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation, which may include significant civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment and exclusion from healthcare programs. The impact of any such violations may lead to curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nAnti-corruption laws. We are also subject to laws regarding the conduct of business overseas, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the Brazil Clean Companies Act, and other similar laws in foreign countries in which we operate. The FCPA prohibits the provision of illegal or improper inducements to foreign government officials in connection with the obtaining of business overseas. Becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to ensure that we and our distributors comply with such laws, rules and regulations and mitigate and protect against corruption risks could be quite costly, and there can be no assurance that any policies and procedures we do implement will protect us against liability under the FCPA or related laws for actions taken by our employees, executive officers, distributors, agents and other intermediaries with respect to our business. Violations of the FCPA or other similar laws by us or any of our employees, executive officers, distributors, agents or other intermediaries could subject us or the individuals involved to criminal or civil liability, cause a loss of reputation in the market, and materially harm our business.\nLaws protecting patient health information. There are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) has promulgated patient privacy rules under the HIPAA. These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information of patients by limiting their use and disclosure, giving patients the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most uses and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. The HIPAA privacy standard was amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Although we are not a \u201ccovered entity\u201d under HIPAA, we are considered a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of certain covered entities and, as such, we are directly subject to HIPAA, including its enforcement scheme and inspection requirements, and are required to implement policies, procedures as well as reasonable and appropriate physical, technical and administrative security measures to protect individually identifiable health information we receive from covered entities. Our failure to protect health information received from customers in compliance with HIPAA or other laws could subject us to civil and criminal liability to the government and civil liability to the covered entity, could result in adverse publicity, and could harm our business and impair our ability to attract new customers.\nTransparency laws. The Sunshine Act, which was enacted by Congress as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on December 14, 2011, requires each applicable manufacturer, which includes medical device companies such as Accuray, to track and report to the federal government on an annual basis all payments and other transfers of value from such applicable manufacturer to U.S. licensed physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership of such applicable manufacturer\u2019s equity, in each case subject to certain statutory exceptions. Furthermore, on October 25, 2018, President Trump signed into law the \u201cSubstance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act\u201d which in part (under a provision entitled \u201cFighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine\u201d) extends the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians in the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021). Such data will be made available by the government on a publicly searchable website. Failure to comply with the data collection and reporting obligations imposed by the Sunshine Act can result in civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum of $150,000 per reporting period) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum of $1 million per reporting period). In addition, we are subject to similar state and foreign laws related to the tracking and reporting of payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals, the violation of which could, among other things, result in civil monetary penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business.\nIf we or our distributors do not obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in a specific country, we will not be able to market and sell our products in that country.\nTo be able to market and sell our products in a specific country, we or our distributors must comply with applicable laws and regulations of that country. In jurisdictions where we rely on our distributors to manage the regulatory process, we are dependent on their ability to do so effectively. While the laws and regulations of some countries do not impose barriers to marketing and selling our products or only require notification, others require that we or our distributors obtain the approval of a specified regulatory body. These laws and regulations, including the requirements for approvals, and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country. The governmental agencies regulating medical devices in some countries, for example, require that the user interface on medical device software be in the local language. We currently provide user guides and manuals, both paper copies and electronically, in the local language but only provide an English language version of the user interface. Obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive and time-consuming, and we cannot be certain that we or our distributors will receive regulatory approvals in each country in which we market or plan to market our products. If we modify our products, we or our distributors may need to apply for additional regulatory approvals before we are permitted to sell them. We may not continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the authorizations that we or our distributors have received. It can also be costly for us and our distributors to keep up with regulatory changes issued or mandated from time to time. If we change distributors, it may be time-consuming and disruptive to our business to transfer the required regulatory approvals, particularly if such approvals are maintained by our third-party distributors on our behalf. If we or our distributors are unable to maintain our authorizations, or fail to obtain appropriate authorizations in a particular country, we will no longer be able to sell our products in that country, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially adversely affected.\nWithin the EU, we are required under the Medical Device Directive to affix the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene, or CE, mark on our products in order to sell the products in member countries of the EU. This conformity to the applicable directives is done through self-declaration and is verified by an independent certification body, called a Notified Body, before the CE mark can be placed on the device. Once the CE mark is affixed to the device, the Notified Body will regularly audit us to ensure that we remain in compliance with the applicable European laws or directives. CE marking demonstrates that our products comply with the laws and regulations required by the European Union countries to allow free movement of trade within those countries. If we cannot support our performance claims and/or demonstrate or maintain compliance with the applicable European laws and directives, we lose our CE mark, which would prevent us from selling our products within the European Union. In addition, the EU\u2019s Medical Device Regulation (\u201cMDR\u201d), which replaced the existing Medical Device Directive, became effective in May 2021. The MDR establishes new requirements and oversight for maintaining the CE mark. The official guidance continues to be published for the implementation of these requirements and the number of Notified Bodies are still limited. There may be variability in review timeframes and requirements as both manufacturers and authorities navigate these new requirements. In addition, the EU and Switzerland failed to establish a Mutual Recognition Agreement (\u201cMRA\u201d) for medical devices to include Switzerland within the MDR and as a result, Switzerland has initiated its own medical device regulation similar to the EU MDR, which will require additional registrations for economic operators and products within Switzerland for our devices.\nUnder the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law in Japan, a pre-market approval necessary to sell, market and import a product, or Shonin, must be obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (\u201cMHLW\u201d), for our products. Before issuing approvals, MHLW examines the application in detail with regard to the quality, efficacy, and safety of the proposed medical device. The Shonin is granted once MHLW is content with the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The time required for approval varies. A delay in approval could prevent us from selling our products in Japan, which could impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.\nIn addition to laws and regulations regarding medical devices, we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations around the world regulating our operations, including those relating to the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials, which laws impose compliance costs on our business and can also result in liability to us. Although we follow procedures intended to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations, risk of accidental contamination or injury can never be fully eliminated. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In addition, future changes in these laws and regulations could also increase our costs of doing business. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance to such standards. For example, the European Union has adopted directives that may lead to restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances or other regulated substances in some of our products sold there, unless such products are eligible for an exemption. While we believe that certain of our products are exempt, there can be no guarantee that such determination would not be challenged or that the regulations would not change in a way that would subject our products to such regulation. These directives, along with other laws and regulations that may be adopted by other countries, could increase our operating costs in order to maintain access to certain markets, which could adversely affect our business.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect demand for our products, our revenue and our financial condition.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d) were signed into law. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In particular, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On June 18, 2021, the United States Supreme Court upheld the ACA, holding that the individuals who brought the lawsuit did not have standing to challenge the law. It is unclear how this decision and the decisions of the current administration will impact the ACA and our business. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe ACA includes a large number of health related provisions, including expanding Medicaid eligibility, requiring most individuals to have health insurance, establishing new regulations on health plans, establishing health insurance exchanges, requiring manufacturers to report payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, modifying certain payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste and including new tools to address fraud and abuse. The laws also include a decrease in the annual rate of inflation for Medicare payments to hospitals and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to suggest methods of reducing the rate of growth in Medicare spending. We do not yet know the full impact that the ACA will have on our business. The expansion in the government's role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by third-party payors for our products, or reduced volume of medical procedures conducted with our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Tax Act was signed into law in December 2017, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. However, with the new administration, the federal government may take further action regarding the ACA, including, but not limited to, reversing the changes implemented by the prior administration and expanding access to coverage under the ACA. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\nIn addition, since the adoption of the ACA, other legislation designed to keep federal healthcare costs down has been proposed or passed. For example, under the sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Medicare payments for all items and services under Parts A and B incurred on or after April 1, 2013 have been reduced by up to 2%. Future federal legislation may impose further limitations on the coverage or amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental\nagencies or third-party payors. These limitations could have a negative impact on the demand for our products and services, and therefore on our financial position and results of operations.\nSince the enactment of the ACA, CMS continues its efforts to move away from fee for service payments for furnishing items and services in Medicare. On September 18, 2020 CMS released the Medicare Program; Specialty Care Models to Improve Quality of Care and Reduce Expenditures final rule. Within this rule, CMS finalized the implementation of a Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model (RO-APM). The RO-APM is a mandatory model that is intended to test whether changing the from a traditional volume-based fee-for-service payment model to a prospective, site neutral, modality agnostic, episode-based payment model will reduce Medicare expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care. This model requires participation from 30% of all eligible Medicare fee-for-service radiation therapy episodes and, with a few minor exceptions, radiotherapy providers who are selected by CMS will be required to participate in this model. The RO-APM has a five-year model performance period that begins on January 1, 2022 and runs through December 31, 2026. It is unclear what impact, if any, the RO-APM and other government payer initiatives will have on our business and operating results, but uncertainties surrounding the new payment model or other initiatives could pause or otherwise delay the purchase of our products by our customers and any resulting decrease in reimbursement to our customers may result in reduced demand for our services.\nFuture legislative or policy initiatives directed at reducing costs could be introduced at either the federal or state level. We cannot predict what healthcare reform legislation or regulations, if any, including any potential repeal or amendment of the ACA, will be enacted in the United States or elsewhere, what impact any legislation or regulations related to the healthcare system that may be enacted or adopted in the future might have on our business, or the effect of ongoing uncertainty or public perception about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers. However, the implementation of new legislation and regulation may materially lower reimbursements for our products, materially reduce medical procedure volumes and significantly and adversely affect our business.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC under such act require companies, including Accuray, to disclose the existence in their products of certain metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are metals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These rules require investigative efforts, which has and will continue to cause us to incur associated costs, could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in our products and may cause reputational harm if we determine that certain of our components contain such conflict minerals or if we are unable to alter our processes or sources of supply to avoid using such materials, all of which could adversely impact sales of our products and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock is volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which could lead to losses for stockholders.\nThe stock market in general has recently experienced relatively large price and volume fluctuations, particularly in response to new news on the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the trading prices of the stock of technology companies of our size can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or out of proportion to the operating performance of these companies. Our stock price has experienced periods of volatility. Broad market fluctuations may also harm our stock price. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of companies that employ similar technology or sell into similar markets could also depress our stock price, regardless of our actual results.\nIn addition to the other risk factors described above and below, factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nimpacts to our business, operations or financial condition caused by concerns in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the related public and private sector responses to the pandemic;\n\u2022\nfiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments related to manufacturing, marketing or sale of the CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platform;\n\u2022\npolitical or social uncertainties;\n\u2022\nchanges in product pricing policies;\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results, as well as costs and expenditures;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 and our own estimates;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe performance of our competitors and investor perception of the markets and industries in which we compete;\n\u2022\nannouncement of strategic transactions or capital raising activities; and\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole.\nThe sale of material amounts of common stock by our stockholders could encourage short sales by third parties and depress the price of our common stock.\nThe downward pressure on our stock price caused by the sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, by any of our significant stockholders could cause our stock price to decline, thus allowing short sellers of our stock an opportunity to take advantage of any decrease in the value of our stock. The presence of short sellers in our common stock may further depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nAny issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or for other reasons.\nIn August 2017, we issued $85.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 and in May 2021, we issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026. $97.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 were issued to certain holders of the 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 in exchange for approximately $82.1 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 and $2.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 were issued to certain other qualified new investors for cash. To the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of any outstanding convertible notes, that conversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nThe conditional conversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion features of the Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes, as applicable, will be entitled to convert such notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert such notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying solely cash in lieu of any fractional share), including if we have irrevocably elected full physical settlement upon conversion, we would be required to make cash payments to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation based on the applicable conversion rate, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert such notes, if we have irrevocably elected net share settlement upon conversion we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nProvisions in the indenture for the Notes, the credit agreement for our New Credit Facilities, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could discourage or prevent a takeover, even if an acquisition would be beneficial in the opinion of our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial in the opinion of our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors, which could discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would limit the ability of less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent and requiring that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Generally, Section 203 prohibits stockholders who, alone or together with their affiliates and associates, own more than 15% of the subject company from engaging in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder of such subject company without approval of the board or 662/3% of the independent stockholders. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nA change of control will also trigger an event of default under the New Credit Facilities. If an event of default occurs, the agent for the lenders under the New Credit Facilities may, at its discretion, suspend or terminate any of the lenders\u2019 loan obligations thereunder and/or declare all or any portion of the loan then-outstanding under the New Credit Facilities, including all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, to be accelerated and immediately due and payable.\nFurthermore, if a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as such term is defined in the applicable indenture of the Notes) occurs, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes. A \u201cfundamental change\u201d generally occurs when there is a change in control of Accuray (acquisition of 50% or more of our voting stock, liquidation or sale of Accuray not for stock in another publicly traded company) or trading of our stock is terminated. In the event of a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d (as such term is defined in the applicable indenture of the Notes), we may also be required to increase the conversion rate applicable to the Notes surrendered for conversion in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. A \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d is generally a sale of Accuray not for stock in another publicly traded company. In addition, the applicable indentures for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes.\nGeneral Risks\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss because of natural disasters, global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, terrorist acts and other events beyond our control, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe have facilities in countries around the world, including two manufacturing facilities, each of which is equipped to manufacture unique components of our products. Our manufacturing facilities are located in Madison, Wisconsin, and Chengdu, China. We do not maintain backup manufacturing facilities for any of our manufacturing `facilities or for our IT facilities, so we depend on each of our current facilities for the continued operation of our business. In addition, we conduct a significant portion of other activities, including administration and data processing, at facilities located in California, which has experienced major earthquakes and fires in the past, as well as other natural disasters. Chengdu, China, where one of our manufacturing facilities is located, has also experienced major earthquakes in the past. We do not carry earthquake insurance. In addition, China has suffered health epidemics related to the outbreak of COVID-19 (including resurgences of COVID-19), avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which could adversely affect our operations in China, including our manufacturing operations in Chengdu, as well as the operations of the JV and those of our customers. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread widely around the world, including in locations where we have facilities and operations. Unexpected events at any of our facilities or otherwise, including as a result of responses to epidemics or pandemics; fires or explosions; natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornados and earthquakes; war or terrorist activities; unplanned outages; supply disruptions; and failures of equipment or systems, including telecommunications systems, or the failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, could significantly disrupt our operations, delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to repair, rebuild or replace our manufacturing facilities, which could be lengthy, result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities, and adversely affect our results of operation. In particular, telecommunication system failures or disruptions could significantly disrupt our operations as a result of our increase remote work arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, concerns about terrorism, the effects of a terrorist attack, political turmoil or an epidemic outbreak could have a negative effect on our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers and the ability to travel, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interpretation or application of generally accepted accounting principles may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and various other regulatory or accounting bodies. A change in interpretations of, or our application of, these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Additionally, as we are required to adopt new accounting standards, our methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause our results of operations to\nfluctuate from period to period. For example, upon adoption of ASC 606, we now recognize system revenue upon transfer of control, which is generally at time of delivery. Under the previous accounting guidance, we recognized system revenue upon acceptance when and if we have installation responsibilities. If circumstances change over time or interpretation of the revenue recognition rules change, we could be required to adjust the timing of recognizing revenue and our financial results could suffer.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects, contractual arrangements, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, a return on a stockholders\u2019 investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 91814, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ARAY"}
