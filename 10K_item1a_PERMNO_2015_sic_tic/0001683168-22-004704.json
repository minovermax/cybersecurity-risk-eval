{"cik": "704562", "company": "Avid Bioservices, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-06-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us and impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the events or developments discussed in the risk factors below could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, in such case, our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny public health epidemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including our customers and suppliers. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected by: disruptions in our customers\u2019 abilities to fund, develop, or bring to market products as anticipated; delays in or disruptions to the conduct of clinical trials by our customers; cancellations of contracts or confirmed orders from our customers; and inability, difficulty, or additional cost or delays in obtaining key raw materials, components, and other supplies from our existing supply chain; among other factors caused by a public health epidemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material negative effect on our overall business, financial condition or results of operations to date, our customers and suppliers have in some cases experienced negative impacts due to disruptions in supply chains and disruptions to the operations of the FDA and other drug regulatory authorities, which resulted in, among other things, delays of inspections, reviews, and approvals of our customers\u2019 products, as well as the volume and timing of orders from these customers. Such impacts may affect our business in the future. Governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which continue to evolve, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business closures, new safety requirements or regulations, or restrictions on the import or export of certain materials, or other operational issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe continue to monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, operations, and financial condition. For purposes of our operational and financial planning, we have made, and update when appropriate, certain assumptions regarding the duration, severity, and economic impact of the pandemic. However, despite careful planning, our assumptions may not be accurate, as the extent to which COVID-19 may affect our future results will depend on future developments that are uncertain, including: the duration of the pandemic; emerging information concerning the severity and incidence of the virus and its variants; the emergence of additional virus variants; regional resurgences of the virus globally; the safety, efficacy, and availability of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 (including its variants); the rate at which the population globally becomes vaccinated against COVID-19; the global economic impact of the pandemic; the actions of governments and regulatory authorities to contain the pandemic; and the actions the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, competitors, suppliers, customers, patients, and others may take to contain or address the pandemic\u2019s direct and indirect effects.\nIn addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health epidemic could exacerbate other risks we face, including those described elsewhere in \"Risk Factors.\"\nThe demand for our development and manufacturing services depends in part on our customers\u2019 research and development and the clinical and market success of their products. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on, or are less successful in, these activities. In addition, customer spending may be affected by, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic or recessionary economic conditions caused in whole or in part by the pandemic.\nOur customers are engaged in research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products. The amount of customer spending on research, development, production, and marketing, as well as the outcomes of such research, development, and marketing activities, have a large impact on our revenues and profitability, particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our services. Available resources, the need to develop new products, and consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending. Our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources. A reduction in spending by our customers, which may be influenced by the recent sharp downturn in available private and public funding for small and emerging biotechnology companies, and the continuing direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions, reimbursement issues, or other factors, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA significant portion of our revenues comes from a limited number of customers.\nOur revenues have historically been derived from a limited number of customers. For example, for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we derived approximately 60%, 76% and 63% of our revenues from our top three customers, respectively. Although we continue to expand our customer base, we remain dependent on a limited number of customers for a substantial majority of our revenues. The loss of, or a significant reduction of business from, any of our primary customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe generally do not have long-term customer contracts and our backlog cannot be relied upon as a future indicator of revenues.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers, and existing contracts and purchase commitments may be canceled under certain circumstances. As a result, we are exposed to market and competitive price pressures on every order, and our agreements with customers do not provide assurance of future revenues. Our customers are not required to make minimum purchases and, in certain circumstances, may cease using our services at any time without penalty. Our backlog should not be relied on as a measure of anticipated demand or future revenue, because the orders constituting our backlog may be subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellation without significant penalty to the customer. Any reductions, cancellations or deferrals in customer orders would negatively impact our business.\nWe are making a significant investment by expanding our CDMO service offering into the development and manufacture of viral vectors which will subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur announced expansion in October 2021 of our CDMO service offering into viral vector development and manufacturing services for the cell and gene therapy market involves a number of risks that could adversely affect our operations and financial results, including the following risks:\n\u00b7 we may experience delays in the construction of the manufacturing facility and associated laboratories, including delays in the receipt, installation and/or validation of necessary equipment;\n\u00b7 we may experience significant cost overruns associated with the construction of the facility;\n\u00b7 our entry into a new service offering may distract our executive teams\u2019 focus on our core mammalian cell culture operations;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to timely hire qualified individuals to manage and our viral vector operations; and\n\u00b7 we may experience delays and other challenges in engaging our initial viral vector customers due to our lack of operating experience in the viral vector market.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we are commencing a service offering that is currently dominated by a small number of larger organizations with established viral vector operations and significantly greater financial resources with whom we may experience difficulties in competing for talent and customers. If we are unable to manage these risks, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe are presently making a significant capital investment in our Myford facility in order to meet potential future mammalian cell culture development and manufacturing needs and, as a result, we depend on the success of attracting new and retaining existing customers\u2019 business.\nIn fiscal 2021, we initiated two phases of expansion in our Myford facility. The first phase was completed in January 2022 and expands the production capacity of our existing north side of our Myford facility by adding an additional downstream processing suite. The second phase is anticipated to be online during the first calendar quarter of 2023 and will further expand our capacity through the build out of a second manufacturing train, including both upstream and downstream processing suites, within the south side of our Myford facility. This expansion represents a substantial investment in our manufacturing capabilities, and as a result, our fixed cost will be significantly increasing. If, upon completion of the two phases of expansion, we are not able to utilize the additional capacity, our margins could be adversely affected. Further, there can be no assurance that our future revenues will be sufficient to ensure the economical operation of this expanded capacity, in which case, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur rapid growth during fiscal years 2021 and 2022 may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may fail to manage our growth effectively.\nFor the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our revenues were $119.6 million, $95.9 million and $59.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 25% and 61%, respectively. We believe our ability to continue to experience revenue growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7 increase our manufacturing capacity by timely completing the expansion of our Myford facility;\n\u00b7 complete the construction of, and begin to generate revenues from, our cell and gene therapy facility\n\u00b7 continue to expand our customer base, and identify and focus on additional development and manufacturing opportunities with existing customers;\n\u00b7 effectively compete with our competitors in the contract development and manufacturing sector;\n\u00b7 continue to broaden our market awareness through a diversified, yet flexible, marketing strategy; and\n\u00b7 selectively pursue complementary or adjacent service offerings, either organically or through acquisition.\nMoreover, we continue to expand our headcount and operations. We grew from 227 employees as of April 30, 2020 to 327 employees as of April 30, 2022. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term and beyond. This potential future growth could place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial resources, company culture and infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively while retaining personnel. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in adding new clients, maintaining our strong quality systems, declines in quality or client satisfaction, increases in costs, system failures, difficulties in introducing new features or solutions, the need for more capital than we anticipate or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could harm our business performance and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to supply most of the necessary raw materials and supplies for the products we manufacture on behalf of our customers and our inability to obtain such raw materials or supplies may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations require various raw materials, including proprietary media, resins, buffers, and filters, in addition to numerous additional raw materials supplied primarily by third parties. We or our customers specify the raw materials and other items required to manufacture their product and, in some cases, specify the suppliers from whom we must purchase these raw materials. In certain instances, the raw materials and other items can only be supplied by a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single source, or in limited quantities. If third-party suppliers do not supply raw materials or other items on a timely basis, it may cause a manufacturing run to be delayed or canceled which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we do not have long-term supply contracts with any of our single source suppliers. If we experience difficulties acquiring sufficient quantities of required materials or products from our existing suppliers, or if our suppliers are found to be non-compliant with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulation, CGMPs or other applicable laws or regulations, we would be required to find alternative suppliers. If our primary suppliers become unable or unwilling to perform, any resulting delays or interruptions in the supply of raw materials required to support our manufacturing of CGMP pharmaceutical-grade products would ultimately delay our manufacture of products for our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, third-party suppliers may fail to provide us with raw materials and other items that meet the qualifications and specifications required by us or our customers. If third-party suppliers are not able to provide us with raw materials that meet our or our customers\u2019 specifications on a timely basis, we may be unable to manufacture their product or it could prevent us from delivering products to our customers within required timeframes. Any such delay in delivering our products may create liability for us to our customers for breach of contract or cause us to experience order cancellations and loss of customers. In the event that we manufacture products with inferior quality components and raw materials, we may become subject to product liability claims caused by defective raw materials or components from a third-party supplier or from a customer, or our customer may be required to recall its products from the market.\nAll of our manufacturing facilities are situated in Orange County, California, which increases our exposure to significant disruption to our business as a result of unforeseeable developments in a single geographic area.\nWe operate our manufacturing facilities in Orange County, California. It is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen catastrophic events occurring in or around our facilities. It is also possible that operations could be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages, explosions, fires, floods, earthquakes or accidents. As a result, we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations, accept materials from suppliers, meet customer shipment needs or address other severe consequences that may be encountered, and we may suffer damage to our reputation. Our financial condition and results of our operations could be materially adversely affected were such events to occur.\nOur manufacturing services are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely services to our customers, our business could suffer.\nThe manufacturing services we offer are highly complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. A failure of our quality control systems in our facilities could cause problems to arise in connection with facility operations for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, viral contamination, failure to follow specific manufacturing instructions, protocols and standard operating procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors. Such problems could affect production of a single manufacturing run or a series of runs, requiring the destruction of products, or could halt manufacturing operations altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers which, in turn, could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such incident could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug substance, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other manufacturing runs. With respect to our commercial manufacturing, if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be subject to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such issues could subject us to litigation, the cost of which could be significant.\nIf we do not enhance our existing, or introduce new, service offerings in a timely manner, our offerings may become obsolete or noncompetitive over time, customers may not buy our offerings and our revenues and profitability may decline.\nDemand for our manufacturing services may change in ways that we may not anticipate due to evolving industry standards and customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied, as well as the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings. In the event we are unable to offer or enhance our service offerings or expand our manufacturing infrastructure to accommodate requests from our customers and potential customers, our offerings may become obsolete or noncompetitive over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. For example, if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our customers through enhancing our offerings, our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements. Potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial capital investment before we can determine their commercial viability, and we may not have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations. Even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings, however, they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of our costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features. Finally, the marketplace may not accept our innovations due to, among other things, existing patterns of clinical practice, the need for regulatory clearance and/or uncertainty over market access or government or third-party reimbursement.\nIf we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur contract manufacturing operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials or chemicals. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our contract manufacturing operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential product liability claims, errors and omissions claims in connection with services we perform and potential liability under indemnification agreements between us and our officers and directors could adversely affect us.\nWe manufacture products intended for use in humans. These activities could expose us to risk of liability for personal injury or death to persons using such products. We seek to reduce our potential liability through measures such as contractual indemnification provisions with customers (the scope of which may vary by customer, and the performances of which are not secured) and insurance maintained by us and our customers. We could be materially adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of the indemnification agreements, if the indemnity, although applicable, is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liabilities exceed the amount of applicable insurance or indemnity. In addition, we could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services we perform. Although we currently maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance with respect to these risks, such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.\nWe also indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Although we have a director and officer insurance policy that covers a portion of any potential exposure, we could be materially and adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or incur legal costs in connection with a claim above such insurance limits.\nAny claims beyond our insurance coverage limits, or that are otherwise not covered by our insurance, may result in substantial costs and a reduction in our available capital resources.\nWe maintain property insurance, employer\u2019s liability insurance, product liability insurance, general liability insurance, business interruption insurance, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, among others. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage, potential claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy, which could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. Generally, we would be at risk for the loss of inventory that is not within customer specifications. These amounts could be significant. In addition, in the future we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or we may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage.\nThird parties may claim that our services or our customer\u2019s products infringe on or misappropriate their intellectual property rights.\nAny claims that our services infringe the rights of third parties, including claims arising from any of our customer engagements, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in such proceedings, given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required, among other things, to pay substantial damages, discontinue the use of the infringing technology, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, license such technology from the third party claiming infringement (which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all) and/or cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing processes or offerings, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured and they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology which we may provide. Any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel and the loss of key personnel could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical employees, as well as a number of key executives. These employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. We may not be able to retain key personnel, or attract and retain additional qualified employees. We do not maintain key-man or similar policies covering any of our senior management or key personnel. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carry forwards which, if we were to become profitable, could be used to offset/defer federal and state income taxes. Our ability to use such carry forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations related to changes in ownership of our stock and decisions by California and other states to limit or suspend NOL carry forwards.\nAs of April 30, 2022, we had federal and state NOL carry forwards of approximately $384 million and $312 million, respectively. These NOL carry forwards could potentially be used to offset certain future federal and state income tax liabilities. The federal net operating loss carry forwards generated prior to January 1, 2018 expire in fiscal years 2024 through 2038. The federal net operating loss generated after January 1, 2018 of $19.6 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of net operating losses generated subsequent to 2020 are limited to 80% of future taxable income. However, utilization of NOL carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. A Section 382 analysis has been completed through the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, which it was determined that no such change in ownership had occurred. However, ownership changes occurring subsequent to April 30, 2022 may impact the utilization of our NOL carry forwards and other tax attributes. Additionally, states may impose other limitations on the use of state NOL carry forwards. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the carry forwards before utilization. If we were not able to utilize our carry forwards, we would be required to use our cash resources to pay taxes that would otherwise have been offset, thereby reducing our liquidity.\nWe have recorded significant deferred tax assets, and we might never realize their full value, which would result in a change against our earnings.\nAs of April 30, 2022, we had deferred tax assets of $115.1 million. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the tax benefit from those assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed on a periodic basis for realizability. A charge against our earnings would result if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized beyond our existing valuation allowance, if any. This could be caused by, among other things, deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the services provided by our business and a variety of other factors.\nIf a deferred tax asset net of our valuation allowance, if any, was determined to be not realizable in a future period, the charge to earnings would be recognized as an expense in our results of operations in the period the determination is made. Additionally, if we are unable to utilize our deferred tax assets, our cash flow available to fund operations could be adversely affected. Depending on future circumstances, it is possible that we might never realize the full value of our deferred tax assets. Any future impairment charges related to a significant portion of our deferred tax assets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.\nWe, as well as certain of our directors and officers, may be subject to claims or lawsuits during the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted.\nWe have become increasingly dependent on information technology and any breakdown, interruption or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure in connection with the conduct of our business. We must constantly update our information technology infrastructure and our various current information technology systems throughout the organization may not continue to meet our current and future business needs. Furthermore, modification, upgrade or replacement of such systems may be costly. In addition, due to the size and complexity of these systems, any breakdown, interruption, corruption or unauthorized access to or cyber-attack on these systems could create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. While we attempt to take appropriate security and cyber-security measures to protect our data and information technology systems and to prevent such breakdowns and unauthorized breaches and cyber-attacks, these measures may not be successful and these breakdowns and breaches in, or attacks on, our systems and data may not be prevented. Such breakdowns, breaches or attacks may cause business interruption and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could cause the market value of our shares of common stock to decline, and we may suffer financial damage or other loss, including fines or criminal penalties because of lost or misappropriated information.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosures, including practices and disclosures related to climate change, diversity and inclusion and governance standards. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, lenders, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. In addition, government organizations are enhancing or advancing legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters. The heightened stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in noncompliance, the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers and an inability to attract and retain top talent. In addition, our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of complementary businesses, and the failure to manage acquisitions, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire other companies, products or technologies that may enhance our manufacturing capabilities, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base, or advance our business strategies. Potential acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: problems assimilating the acquired service offerings, products or technologies; issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, quality control and policies; unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions; diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business; risks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; increased legal and accounting costs relating to the acquisitions or compliance with regulatory matters; and unanticipated or undisclosed liabilities of any target.\nWe have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition. We do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired service offerings, products or technologies. Our potential inability to integrate any acquired service offerings, products or technologies effectively may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Customers\nThe consumers of the products we manufacture for our customers may significantly influence our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on, and have no control over, consumer demand for the products we manufacture for our customers. Consumer demand for our customers\u2019 products could be adversely affected by, among other things, delays in health regulatory approval, the inability of our customers to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of their products, the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights protection, the emergence of competing or alternative products, including generic drugs, the degree to which private and government payment subsidies for a particular product offset the cost to consumers and changes in the marketing strategies for such products and the outbreak of a pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, if the products we manufacture for our customers do not gain market acceptance, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that continued changes to the healthcare industry, including ongoing healthcare reform, adverse changes in government or private funding of healthcare products and services, legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information or patient access to care, or the delivery, pricing or reimbursement of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to purchase fewer services from us or influence the price that others are willing to pay for our services. Changes in the healthcare industry\u2019s pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and profitability.\nIf production volumes of key products that we manufacture for our customers decline, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur customers\u2019 failure to receive or maintain regulatory approval for their product candidates could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nOur success depends upon the regulatory approval of the products we manufacture. As such, if our customers experience a delay in, or failure to receive, approval for any of their product candidates or fail to maintain regulatory approval of their products and we are not able to manufacture these products, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. Additionally, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve of our facilities for the manufacture of a customer product or if it withdraws such approval in the future, our customers may choose to identify alternative manufacturing facilities and/or relationships, which could significantly impact our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity and capabilities and achieve profitability.\nWe depend on spending and demand from our customers for our contract manufacturing and development services and any reduction in spending or demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe amount that our customers spend on the development and manufacture of their products or product candidates, particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on outsourcing these services to us, substantially impacts our revenue and profitability. The outcomes of our customers\u2019 research, development and marketing also significantly influence the amount that our customers choose to spend on our services and offerings. Our customers determine the amounts that they will spend on our services based upon, among other things, the clinical and market success of their products, available resources, access to capital and their need to develop new products which, in turn, depend upon a number of other factors, including their competitors\u2019 research, development and product initiatives and the anticipated market for any new products, as well as clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas. Further, increasing consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may impact such spending, particularly in the event that any of our customers choose to develop or acquire integrated manufacturing operations. Any reduction in customer spending on biologics development and related services as a result of these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our customers\u2019 proprietary information, we may be subject to claims.\nMany of the formulations used and processes developed by us in the manufacture of our customers\u2019 products are subject to trade secret protection, patents or other intellectual property protections owned or licensed by such customer. While we make significant efforts to protect our customers\u2019 proprietary and confidential information, including requiring our employees to enter into agreements protecting such information, if any of our employees breaches the non-disclosure provisions in such agreements, or if our customers make claims that their proprietary information has been disclosed, our reputation may suffer damage and we may become subject to legal proceedings that could require us to incur significant expense and divert our management\u2019s time, attention and resources.\nRisks Related to the Industry in Which We Operate\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly regulated. We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, provincial, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities in which we manufacture products or in which our customers\u2019 products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with CGMPs, import and export, and product registration and listing, among other things. As a result, most of our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions where our customers have marketing approval for their products including, but not limited to, the EMA, ANVISA and/or Health Canada, depending on the countries in which our customers market and sell the products we manufacture on their behalf. As we expand our operations, we may be exposed to more complex and new regulatory and administrative requirements and legal risks, any of which may require expertise in which we have little or no experience. It is possible that compliance with new regulatory requirements could impose significant compliance costs on us. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers\u2019 products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve: (i) facilities for testing or manufacturing products or (ii) products for commercialization. The FDA and other regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 changes to the regulatory approval process, including new data requirements for product candidates in those jurisdictions, including the United States, in which our customers may be seeking approval;\n\u00b7 that a customer\u2019s product candidate may not be deemed to be safe or effective; and\n\u00b7 the inability of the regulatory agency to provide timely responses as a result of its resource constraints;\n\u00b7 that the manufacturing processes or facilities may not meet the applicable requirements.\nIn addition, if new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards. This may require a change in our development and manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities. Any related costs may be significant. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the future, then we may be subject to warning letters and/or civil or criminal penalties and fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, restrictions on the import and export of our products, debarment, exclusion, disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution and the loss of contracts and resulting revenue losses. Inspections by regulatory authorities that identify any deficiencies could result in remedial actions, production stoppages or facility closure, which would disrupt the manufacturing process and supply of product to our customers. In addition, such failure to comply could expose us to contractual and product liability claims, including claims by customers for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or recall or other corrective actions, the cost of which could be significant.\nIn addition, certain products we manufacture must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products may delay or put on hold clinical trials or delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facility, including any newly commissioned facility, is not able to demonstrate compliance with CGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which we or our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product we manufacture is adulterated or misbranded. If our manufacturing facilities and services are not in compliance with FDA and comparable government authorities, we may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary approvals to continue manufacturing products for our customers, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and competition may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a market that is highly competitive. Our competition in the contract manufacturing market includes full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. We may also compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical companies that choose to source their product offerings internally. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge, particularly in lower-cost jurisdictions such as India and China, which could, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur issuance of additional capital stock pursuant to our stock incentive plan, or in connection with financings, acquisitions, or otherwise will dilute the interests of other security holders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our stock incentive plan. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our growth strategy, we may seek to acquire companies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities, the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. For example, if we elect to settle our conversion obligation under our 1.250% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, the issuance of such common stock may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and sales in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices.\nOur highly volatile stock price may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has generally been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. For instance, the market price of our common stock has ranged from $3.02 to $34.51 per share over the last three fiscal years ended April 30, 2022.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly impacted by many factors including the following:\n\u00b7 the loss of a significant customer;\n\u00b7 significant changes in our financial results or that of our competitors, including our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u00b7 the ability to meet our revenue guidance;\n\u00b7 the offering and sale of shares of our common stock, either sold at market prices or at a discount under an equity transaction;\n\u00b7 significant changes in our capital structure;\n\u00b7 published reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 actual or purported short squeeze trading activity;\n\u00b7 announcements of partnering transactions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and any other transaction that involves the development, sale or use of our technologies or competitive technologies;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments, including possible delays in the regulatory approval of our customers\u2019 products which we manufacture;\n\u00b7 outcomes of significant litigation, disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings;\n\u00b7 general stock trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry sectors;\n\u00b7 public concerns as to the safety and effectiveness of the products we manufacture;\n\u00b7 economic trends and other external factors including, but not limited to, interest rate fluctuations, economic recession, inflation, foreign market trends, national crisis, and disasters; and\n\u00b7 healthcare reimbursement reform and cost-containment measures implemented by government agencies.\nThese and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of our common stock, and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, the Indenture, as well as provisions of Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include: authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt; no provision for the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors; limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings; requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders (i.e. no provision for stockholder action by written consent); and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, in connection with our Convertible Notes issuances, we entered into an indenture dated as of March 12, 2021 as amended by a first supplemental indenture dated April 30, 2021 (as amended or supplemented, the \u201cIndenture\u201d) with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Certain provisions in the Indenture could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes in cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with such takeover. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who owns at least 15% of our common stock.\nOur bylaws, as amended, provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws, as amended, provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of the trading price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about us, or if they issue adverse opinions about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business will influence the market for our common stock. If one or more analysts who cover us issues an adverse opinion about us, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases research coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets which, in turn, could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Further, if we fail to meet the market expectations of analysts who follow our stock, our stock price likely would decline.\nRisks Related to Our Outstanding Convertible Notes\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our significant debt when due, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nIn March 2021, we issued the Convertible Notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our future debt agreements, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes, from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt, repurchasing our stock, pledging our assets, making investments, paying dividends, guaranteeing debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Convertible Notes when due.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes when these conversion triggers are satisfied, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of our Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock as a result of conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may have purchased shares of common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes, including with certain investors in the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes. They are likely to do so on each exercise date for the capped call transactions, which are expected to occur during each 40 trading day period beginning on the 41st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the Convertible Notes. This activity could also cause or prevent an increase or decrease in the price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions on the price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties may default, fail to perform or exercise their termination rights under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If a counterparty to the capped call transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. In addition, upon a default, failure to perform or a termination of the capped call transactions by a counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12266, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CDMO"}
