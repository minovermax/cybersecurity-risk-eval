{"cik": "1326089", "company": "Sundance Energy Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in this report under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference into this annual report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in the price of these commodities may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nOur revenues, profitability, liquidity, ability to access capital and future growth prospects are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGLs. The prices of these commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. For example, average daily prices for NYMEX-WTI crude oil ranged from a high of $66.24 per barrel to a low of $46.31 per barrel during 2019. In March 2020, oil prices dropped sharply to under $20 per barrel, and in April 2020, oil prices dropped further and, for a short period of time, were negative. The prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\ngeneral worldwide and regional economic and political conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe domestic and global supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nthe actions of OPEC and the ability of OPEC and other producing nations, including Russia, to agree to and maintain production levels;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and marketing oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of oil, natural gas and NGL pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign and exports of domestic oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil, natural gas and NGL inventories;\n\u00b7\nfuture regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nglobal or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-19, which may reduce the demand for oil, gas and NGL because of reduced global or national economic activity;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations and taxes;\n\u00b7\nvolatile trading patterns in commodities futures markets;\n\u00b7\nprice and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nshareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas and related infrastructure;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nFurther, oil, natural gas and NGL prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Because approximately 62% and 18% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 were attributed to oil and NGLs, respectively, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. The price of oil has been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue for the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our oil production is sold to purchasers under contracts at market-based prices.\nAny prolonged substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated oil, natural gas and NGL sales to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations. However, we cannot always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. We currently have oil derivatives in place covering the expected 2020 production from our proved developed producing reserves as of January 1, 2020. To the extent we are unhedged, we have significant exposure to adverse changes in the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, lower oil and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced economically. This scenario may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, which could negatively impact our borrowing base and our ability to fund our operations. If this occurs or if production estimates change or exploration or development results deteriorate, successful efforts method of accounting principles may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We might also elect during periods of low commodity prices to shut in or curtail production from wells on our properties. In addition, we could determine during periods of low commodity prices to plug and abandon marginal wells that otherwise may have been allowed to continue to produce for a longer period under conditions of higher prices. Specifically, we may abandon any well if we reasonably believe that the well can no longer produce oil or natural gas in commercially paying quantities.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the terms of our credit facilities.\nOur credit facilities require us to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants is uncertain and will be affected by our results of operations and financial condition, and events or circumstances beyond our control, including sustained low commodity prices. Absent a waiver or amendment, a breach of any of these covenants contained in our credit facilities could result in an event of default under these facilities.\nSpecifically, due to the recent sharp decline in commodity prices and expectations for commodity prices in 2020, there is uncertainty as to our ability to remain in compliance with certain of the financial covenants and ratios throughout 2020 and early 2021. If we violate these financial covenants and ratios, or any other covenant in our credit facilities, our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, the interest rates under our credit facilities may increase and the lenders\u2019 commitment, if any, to make further loans to us may terminate. In the event that some or all of the amounts outstanding under our credit facilities are accelerated and become immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, such outstanding amounts and our lenders could foreclose upon critical assets. Any of these outcomes would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, our credit facilities contain reporting covenants that requires delivery of audited consolidated financial statements and related reports and certificates on or before certain deadlines provided for in our credit facilities. Additionally, our financial statements must be delivered without a going concern or like qualification or exception. Failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default under our credit facilities. On May 8, 2020 and May 11, 2020, we entered into waivers with our lenders to waive any potential default arising from the failure to deliver audited consolidated financial statements and related reports and certificates by the applicable deadlines, and with respect to inclusion of the going concern explanatory paragraph included in our audit report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. These waivers were effective April 29, 2020, subject to the conditions set forth in the waivers, which included delivery of our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and related reports and certificates, and payment of the fees and expenses of the administrative agent incurred in connection with such waivers. In consideration for the waiver under our senior secured revolving credit facility (\u201cRevolving Facility\u201d), we agreed to certain limitations on our ability to effect draws under the Revolving Facility until such time as the second quarter 2020 borrowing base redetermination has been completed. In addition, in consideration for waiver with respect to our second lien term loan facility (\u201cTerm Loan\u201d), we agreed to amend certain covenants in the Term Loan, as to be mutually agreed with the Term Loan lenders, within 15 days from the execution date. The waiver under our Revolving Facility also provides for a right to require corresponding amendments of that facility manner, as requested by the administrative agent in its discretion. Failure to enter into such amendment with respect to our Term Loan within 15 days (or a similar amendment with respect to our Revolving Facility on the date the Term Loan is amended) would constitute an event of default under our credit facilities, in which case the amounts outstanding under our credit facilities could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not have the funds to repay or ability to refinance such outstanding amounts and our lenders could foreclose upon critical assets. Although we have entered into these waivers, there is no guarantee that our lenders will agree to waive events of default or potential events of default in the future. Failure to obtain such waivers in the future would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For more information on the covenants under our credit facilities and the potential impact of the explanatory paragraph in the audit report, see Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d.\nOur future revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully replace our proved producing reserves.\nOur business strategy is to generate profit through the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Proved reserves generally decline as they are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both. We may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves on an economically viable basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural gas prices increase, the cost of finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.\nDevelopment and exploration activities involve numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered. Drilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the future cost and timing of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. Furthermore, drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nlack of prospective acreage available on acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nunexpected or adverse drilling conditions;\n\u00b7\nelevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u00b7\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\nlimited availability of financing upon acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nreductions in oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with governmental requirements; and\n\u00b7\nshortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel.\nEven if our exploration, development and drilling efforts are successful, our wells, once completed, may not produce reserves of oil, natural gas or NGLs that are economically viable or that meet our prior estimates of economically recoverable reserves. Unsuccessful drilling activities could result in a significant decline in our production and revenues and materially harm our operations and financial position by reducing our available cash and liquidity. In addition, the potential for production decline rates for our wells could be greater than we expect. Because of the risks and uncertainties inherent to our businesses, our future drilling results may not be comparable to our historical results described elsewhere in this annual report.\nDevelopment of our PUDs may take longer than expected and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 76% of our total proved reserves were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflected our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves. Based on our December 31, 2019 reserve report, it will require an estimated $1.2 billion of capital to develop approximately 76.5 MMBoe of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves over the next five years. Development of these undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could require us to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves.\nFurther, our reserve estimates assume that we can and will make these expenditures and that these operations will be conducted successfully. However, these assumptions may not prove correct. If our plans change and we choose not to spend the capital (or are unable to generate adequate cash flow or obtain the necessary capital under our credit facilities or from other sources) to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to remove these reserves from future reserve estimates. Any such removal of our existing reserves could reduce our ability to borrow and adversely affect our liquidity and available capital.\nOur development and exploration projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves with resulting adverse effects on our cash flow and liquidity.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, production and acquisition of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. We expect our 2020 capital program to be in the range of $40 - $45 million. However, we plan to respond flexibly to market conditions to protect our balance sheet and retain liquidity.\nThe actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, regulatory, and technological and competitive developments. We intend to finance our development plan in 2020 primarily with cash flows from operations, but we may also finance our future capital expenditures through a variety of other sources, including available borrowings under our Revolving Facility, through additional asset sales, or through the issuance of debt and/or equity, which may alter or increase our capitalization substantially.\nOur cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u00b7\nour proved reserves;\n\u00b7\nthe volume of oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce and sell from existing proved developed wells;\n\u00b7\nthe prices at which our oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold;\n\u00b7\nthe cost at which our oil, natural gas and NGLs are extracted;\n\u00b7\nglobal credit and securities markets;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves and the cost of such reserves; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our lenders to provide us with credit or additional borrowing capacity.\nIf our revenues or the amounts we can borrow under available credit facilities decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas or NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If cash generated by operations or cash available under our credit facilities is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our locations, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production levels, and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our Revolving Facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.\nOur Revolving Facility generally limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, determine semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Our Revolving Facility has a borrowing base of $210.0 million ($190 million elected commitment), of which $115.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Our next borrowing base redetermination is the second quarter of 2020. Redeterminations are based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition, our lenders have substantial flexibility to reduce our borrowing base due to subjective factors. Upon a redetermination, we could be required to repay a portion of the debt owed under our Revolving Facility to the extent our outstanding borrowings at such time exceeds the redetermined borrowing base. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments, which could result in a default under the terms of our Revolving Facility and an acceleration of the loans outstanding under our Revolving Facility and our other credit facilities. Failure to timely pay these debt obligations when due could cause us to lose our assets through mortgage foreclosure, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, in the future we may not have access to adequate funding under our Revolving Facility as a result of a decrease in our borrowing base due to the issuance of new indebtedness, the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination or an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations and the inability of other lenders to provide additional funding to cover any defaulting lender\u2019s portion. Declines in commodity prices could result in a determination to lower the borrowing base in the future and, in such a case, we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. As a result, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans or make required repayments under the Revolving Facility or our other credit facilities, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEffective April 29, 2020, we entered into a waiver with respect to any potential default arising from the reporting covenant under our Revolving Facility that requires delivery of audited consolidated financial statements on or before the deadline provided for in the Revolving Facility, and to deliver such financial statements without a going concern or like qualification or exception for the year ended December 31, 2019. In consideration for the waiver, we agreed to certain limitations on our ability to effect draws under the Revolving Facility until such time as the second quarter 2020 borrowing base redetermination has been completed. See Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations and is likely to have a continuing adverse impact for a significant period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a rapid and precipitous drop in demand for oil, which in turn has caused oil prices to plummet since the first week of March 2020, negatively affecting the Company\u2019s cash flow, liquidity and financial position. Moreover, the uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused storage constraints in the United States resulting from over-supply of produced oil, which is expected to significantly decrease our realized oil prices in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially beyond. Oil prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of these events and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and as changes in oil inventories, oil demand and economic performance are reported. We cannot predict when oil prices will improve and stabilize.\nThe current pandemic and uncertainty about its length and depth in future periods has caused the realized oil prices we have received since February 2020 to be significantly reduced, adversely affecting our operating cash flow and liquidity. While we continue to flexibly manage our operations, including capital expenditure levels, based on existing and expected market conditions, our lower levels of cash flow could affect our borrowing capacity and may require us to shut-in production that has become uneconomic. These conditions may also increase the difficulty in repaying, refinancing or restructuring our long-term debt.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, and the ultimate impact of this pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or mitigate its impact, related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on domestic and global oil demand.\nChanges in the differential between benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price used to price our actual oil and natural gas sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe reference or regional index prices that we will use to price our oil and natural gas sales sometimes will reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we reference in our sales contracts is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in differentials between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price we reference in our sales contracts could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur level of indebtedness may reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe intend to fund our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and, if necessary borrowings under available credit facilities and alternative debt or equity financings. If we obtain alternative debt or equity financing for these or other purposes, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our level of debt could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in several important ways, including the following:\n\u00b7\na portion of our cash flow from operations would be used to pay interest on borrowings;\n\u00b7\nthe covenants contained in available credit facilities limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends, dispose of assets or issue shares of preferred stock and otherwise may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in general business and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\na high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n\u00b7\na leveraged financial position would make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and decreases in commodity prices and could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures; and\n\u00b7\nthe debt we currently hold, as well as any debt that we incur under our existing Revolving Facility will be at variable rates which could make us vulnerable to an increase in interest rates.\nThe interest rates under our credit facilities may be impacted by the phase-out of LIBOR.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. We generally use LIBOR as a reference rate to calculate interest rates under our credit facilities. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist or replaced with an alternative reference rate, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements to replace LIBOR with an agreed upon replacement index, and certain of the interest rates under our credit agreements may change. The new rates may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out. We may also find it desirable to engage in more frequent interest rate hedging transactions.\nOperating hazards, natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities, which may not be fully covered by our insurance.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves operating hazards such as:\n\u00b7\nwell blowouts;\n\u00b7\nmechanical failures;\n\u00b7\nfires and explosions;\n\u00b7\npipe or cement failures and casing collapses, which could release natural gas, oil, drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u00b7\ngeologic formations with abnormal pressures;\n\u00b7\nhandling and disposal of materials, including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u00b7\npipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u00b7\ninclement weather, including flooding, hurricanes or other severe weather events;\n\u00b7\nreleases of toxic gases; and\n\u00b7\nother environmental hazards and risks (including groundwater contamination).\nAny of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution, personal injury claims, regulatory investigation, penalties and suspension of operation and other damage to our properties and the property of others.\nWe maintain insurance against losses and liabilities in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that our management believes to be prudent. However, insurance against all operational risks is not available to us. We do not carry business interruption insurance. We may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nIn addition, losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. We cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe depend upon several significant customers for the sale of most of our oil, natural gas and NGL production.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, purchases by two customers each accounted for over 10% of our total sales revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers or the inability or failure of either of these customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation could adversely affect our revenues in the short term. While we believe that we can procure substitute or additional customers to offset the loss of one or more of our current customers, there is no assurance that we would be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to us or at all. The availability of a ready market for any oil, natural gas or NGLs we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil, natural gas and NGL production and federal regulation of oil, natural gas and NGL in interstate commerce.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional PUDs in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, our PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement limits our ability to book additional PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write-down our PUDs if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year time frame, or if oil and natural gas prices decrease, making the PUDs uneconomic. Lower PV-10 value, resulting from fewer PUDs, may negatively impact our investor perception.\nOur planned drilling involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which are subject to risks. As a result, drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.\nOur operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers in order to maximize cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nlanding our well bore in the desired formation;\n\u00b7\nstaying in the desired formation while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u00b7\nrunning our casing the entire length of the well bore; and\n\u00b7\nbeing able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the well bore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nbeing able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u00b7\nbeing able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; and\n\u00b7\nnegatively impacting offset producing wells through subsurface communication during fracture stimulation.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling does not meet our anticipated results or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems and limited takeaway capacity or otherwise and/or oil and natural gas prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments, we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled to be developed over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur final determination of whether to drill any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nongoing review and analysis of geologic and engineering data;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for drilling and completing of the locations;\n\u00b7\nthe approval of the locations by other participants once additional data has been compiled;\n\u00b7\neconomic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability and prices of drilling rigs and personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to maintain, extend or renew leases and permits on reasonable terms for the locations;\n\u00b7\nadditional due diligence;\n\u00b7\nregulatory requirements and restrictions; and\n\u00b7\nthe opportunity to divert our drilling budget to preferred locations.\nAlthough we have identified or budgeted for numerous drilling locations, we may not be able to lease or drill those locations within our expected time frame or at all. Wells that are currently part of our capital plan may be based on results of drilling activities in other areas that we believe are geologically similar to a location rather than on analysis of seismic or other data in the location area, in which case actual drilling and results are likely to vary, possibly materially, from results in other areas. In addition, our drilling schedule may vary from our expectations because of future uncertainties, and our ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs may be significantly affected by the availability and prices of equipment and personnel.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing properties. These locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. Therefore, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nIn addition, we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these potential locations may not be successful or result in the addition of proved reserves to our overall proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Our operations are concentrated in areas in which the oil and gas industry has historically increased rapidly, and as a result, demand for such drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, as well as access to transportation, processing and refining facilities in these areas, and the costs for those items also increased. We cannot predict the future availability or costs of these items. However, any delay or inability to secure the personnel, equipment, power, services, resources and facilities access necessary for us to maintain or increase our development activities, could result in production volumes being below our forecasted volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and profitability. Furthermore, if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases expiring over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production is established. For these properties, if production in commercial quantities has not been established on the leased property or units that include the leased property containing these leases, our leases will expire and we will lose our right to develop the related properties. As of December 31, 2019, 2,118 net acres of our total acreage position were not held by production. For the acreage underlying such properties, if production in paying quantities is not established on units containing these leases, or extensions are not successfully obtained, 1,927 net acres will expire in 2020, and approximately 191 net acres will expire in 2021 and 2022. In addition, approximately 4,500 net acres is currently held by production, but is subject to future drilling obligations.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nIn accordance with our business strategies, we periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u00b7\nfuture oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u00b7\ntiming of development;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment and operating costs; and\n\u00b7\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nSignificant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u00b7\nthe challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of our operations while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u00b7\nthe challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nIn addition, even if we successfully integrate an acquisition, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect, including with respect to estimated proved reserves, production volume or cost savings from operating synergies, within our expected time frame. Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices in oil and natural gas industry conditions, risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the combined assets or operations, or an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties. Failure to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur producing properties are located primarily in the Eagle Ford, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited number of geographic areas.\nAll of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Eagle Ford area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by governmental regulation (including any proration and production restrictions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise), processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate and any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe reserve data in this annual report represent only estimates. There are uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated value, including many factors beyond our control. Reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner and is based on assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results. Reservoir engineering also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Accordingly, actual production, oil and natural gas prices, revenue, taxes, operating expenses, expenditures and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will likely vary, possibly materially, from estimates. Any significant variance in our estimates or the accuracy of our assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this annual report, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nBecause oil and natural gas prices are subject to volatility, we regularly enter into price-risk-management transactions such as fixed-rate swaps, costless collars, puts, calls and basis differential swaps to reduce our exposure to price declines associated with a portion of our oil and natural gas production and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow. The use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of oil and natural gas. Our derivative arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production, thereby providing only partial protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices.\nThese arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which production is less than expected, our customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil and natural gas or a sudden, unexpected event that materially impacts oil or natural gas prices. In addition, the counterparties under our derivatives contracts may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us.\nIf the recent decline in oil and natural gas prices is sustained or prices decline further, we may be required to write-down the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our producing oil and gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews (which may include depressed oil, natural gas and NGL prices and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics, possible asset sales and other factors), we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. For example, we incurred impairment of oil and gas properties held for sale of $10.0 million and $43.0 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe discounted future net cash flows in this annual report are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC regulations, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average of the historical sales price on the first day of each month in the applicable year, with costs determined as of the date of the estimate. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by various factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nour actual operating costs in producing oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u00b7\nsupply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nincreases or decreases in consumption of oil and natural gas; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\nOur inability to market our oil and natural gas could adversely affect our business.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and gathering facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby requiring compression facilities or delivery by other means, such as trucking and train. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our oil or natural gas may have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we are unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended period of time, possibly resulting in the loss of a lease due to the lack of commercially established production.\nWe generally deliver our oil and natural gas production through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own under interruptible or short-term transportation agreements. Under the interruptible transportation agreements, the transportation of our oil and natural gas production may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system, for maintenance or repair of the system or for other reasons as dictated by the particular agreements. We may also enter into firm transportation arrangements for additional production in the future. Because we are obligated to pay fees on minimum volumes to our service providers under these agreements regardless of actual volume throughput, these firm transportation agreements may be significantly more costly than interruptible or short-term transportation agreements, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA portion of our oil and natural gas production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, or field personnel issues or strikes. We may also voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or curtailed, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur credit facilities have substantial restrictions and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u00b7\nenter into hedging agreements covering volumes above specified ceilings or below specified floors;\n\u00b7\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u00b7\nissue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u00b7\nmake loans and investments;\n\u00b7\nsell assets;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result, we may be limited in how we conduct our business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions may further affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our current and future financing.\nIncreased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be adversely affected by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital and increases in interest rates. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Disruptions in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability, which would impact our ability to finance our operations. We will require continued access to capital for the foreseeable future. A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Public integrated and independent oil and natural gas\ncompanies, private equity backed and private operators are all active bidders for desirable oil and natural gas properties as well as the equipment and personnel required to operate those properties. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than we do. There is a risk that increased industry competition will adversely impact our ability to purchase assets or secure services at prices that will allow us to generate sufficient returns on investment in the future.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business the results of operations, financial condition and future growth.\nWe are reliant on a number of key members of our executive management team. Loss of such personnel may have an adverse effect on our performance. We operate in a highly competitive environment and competition for qualified personnel is intense. We may be unable to hire suitable field personnel for our technical team or there may be periods of time where a particular position remains vacant while a suitable replacement is identified and appointed. Our ability to sustain current operations or manage our growth will require us to continue to train, motivate and manage our employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to grow or operate our business profitably.\nOur ability to manage growth will have an impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth historically has been achieved through the acquisition of leaseholds and the expansion of our drilling programs. Future growth may place strains on our financial, technical, operational and administrative resources and cause us to rely more on project partners and independent contractors, potentially adversely affecting our financial position and results of operations. Our ability to grow will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain leases or options on properties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to identify and acquire new exploratory prospects;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop existing prospects;\n\u00b7\nour ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our drilling programs;\n\u00b7\ncommodity prices; and\n\u00b7\nour access to capital.\nWe may not be successful in upgrading our technical, operational and administrative resources or increasing our internal resources sufficiently to provide certain of the services currently provided by third parties, and we may not be able to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors on financially attractive terms, if at all. Our inability to achieve or manage growth may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.\nWe may lose title to, or interests in, our leases and other properties if the conditions to which those interests are subject are not satisfied or if insufficient funds are available to meet the commitments.\nThe existence of title deficiencies with respect to our oil and natural gas properties could reduce their value or render such properties worthless, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We do not obtain title insurance and have not necessarily obtained drilling title opinions on all of our oil and natural gas properties. As is customary in the industry in which we operate, we generally rely upon the judgment of oil and natural gas lease brokers or independent landmen who perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest and before drilling a well on a leased tract, and we generally make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel before we commence drilling operations. In some cases, we perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability or adequacy of the title assigned to us. In cases involving more serious title problems, the amount paid for affected oil and natural gas leases can be lost, and the target area can become undrillable. While we undertake to cure all title deficiencies prior to drilling, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease, our investment in the well and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property. A significant portion of our acreage is undeveloped leasehold, which has a greater risk of title defects than developed acreage.\nOur operations are subject to health, safety and environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and government regulations that may change from time to time. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, well testing, plug and abandonment requirements and bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. Other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment apply to the development, production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations, including drilling fluids and wastewater. Compliance with existing, new or modified laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, delay our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Federal and state regulators are increasingly targeting GHG emissions from oil and gas operations. While these regulatory efforts are evolving, they may require the installation of emission controls or mandate other action that may result in increased costs of operation, delay, uncertainty or exposure to liability.\nThere is an inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations, some of which may be material, due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, our emissions to air and water, the underground injection or other disposal of our wastes and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable, regardless of whether we were at fault, for the full cost of removing or remediating contamination, even when multiple parties contributed to the release and the contaminants were released in compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, accidental spills or releases on our properties may expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Aside from government agencies, the owners of properties where our wells are located, the operators of facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal and other private parties may be able to sue us to enforce compliance with environmental laws and regulations, as well as collect penalties for violations or obtain damages for any related personal injury or property damage. Some sites we operate are located near current or former third-party oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours.\nIn addition, our operations and financial performance may be adversely affected by governmental action, including delay, inaction, policy change or the introduction of new, or amendment of or changes in interpretation of existing legislation or regulations, particularly in relation to foreign ownership, access to infrastructure, environmental regulation (including in respect of carbon emissions and management), royalties and production and exploration licensing.\nThe conduct of exploration for, and production of, hydrocarbons may expose our staff to potentially harmful working environments. Occupational health and safety legislation and regulations differ in each jurisdiction. In March 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a final rule related to worker exposure to respirable dust from silica sand, a common additive to hydraulic fracturing fluids. Compliance with the rule may require significant investment in engineering and workplace controls. If any of our employees suffer injury or death, compensation payments or fines may have to be paid, and such circumstances could result in the loss of a license or permit required to carry on the business, or other legislative sanction, all of which have the potential to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into physical delivery contracts that will require further development in order to deliver all the oil required under such contracts.\nWe entered into midstream contracts with a large pipeline company and production purchaser to provide gathering, processing, transport and marketing of production for the Eagle Ford assets acquired in 2018. The contracts contain minimum revenue commitments, a portion of which is secured by letters of credit and performance bonds. If the planned development program is not executed to the extent projected, we may not produce sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to meet the minimum revenue commitments and may be required to make cash deficiency payments. The deficiency payments would reduce liquidity to invest in growing the business and profitability. If we are unable to make the deficiency payments, the letters of credit and performance bonds may be drawn causing an increase in our level of indebtedness and potentially result in a default under our loan covenants.\nHydraulic fracturing, which is the process used for releasing hydrocarbons from shale rock, has recently come under increased scrutiny and could be the subject of further regulation that could impact the timing and cost of development.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into deep rock formations to stimulate oil or natural gas production. Currently, hydraulic fracturing is primarily regulated in the U.S. at the state level, which generally focuses on regulation of well design, pressure testing and other operating practices. However, some states and local jurisdictions across the U.S., including states in which we operate, have begun adopting more restrictive regulations, including measures such as:\n\u00b7\nrequired disclosure of chemicals used during the hydraulic fracturing process;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on wastewater disposal activities;\n\u00b7\nrequired baseline and post-drilling sampling of water supplies in close proximity to hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u00b7\nnew municipal or state land use regulations, such as changes in setback requirements, which may restrict drilling locations or related activities;\n\u00b7\nfinancial assurance requirements, such as the posting of bonds, to secure site restoration obligations; and\n\u00b7\nlocal moratoria or even bans on oil and natural gas development utilizing hydraulic fracturing in some communities.\nIn addition, the federal government has the authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands. Under the Obama administration, the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) issued its final regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal and tribal lands that require, among other things, disclosure of chemicals, annulus pressure monitoring, flow back and produced water management and storage, and more stringent well integrity measures associated with hydraulic fracturing operations on public land. The regulations are the subject of litigation, which is still pending. At the U.S. federal level, hydraulic fracturing that does not involve the use of diesel fuels is exempt from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d). However, the U.S. Congress (\u201cCongress\u201d) has considered and may continue to consider eliminating this regulatory exemption, which could subject hydraulic fracturing activities to regulation and permitting by the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) under the SDWA. On June 28, 2016, the EPA issued final pre-treatment standards prohibiting the disposal of wastewater pollutants from on-shore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works. The EPA\u2019s regulation of hydraulic fracturing may result in our incurring additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature. Such regulation may result in our experiencing delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and we could even be prohibited from drilling and/or completing certain wells.\nDespite the existing regulatory exemption, the EPA has begun utilizing other legal authorities in various ways to regulate portions of the hydraulic fracturing process, exemplified by its issuance of regulations under the Clean Air Act limiting emission of pollutants during the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as its recent initiation of a proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to obtain data on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior has proposed comprehensive regulations governing the use of hydraulic fracturing on federally managed lands. Under the current administration, many of these regulations are under review and may be repealed or revised.\nThese efforts by Congress, federal regulators, states and local governments could result in additional costs, delay and operational uncertainty that could limit, preclude or add costs to use of hydraulic fracturing in our drilling operations.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. The impact of the changing demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGL services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing trends of opposition to oil and gas development activity and negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIn recent years, we have seen significant growth in anti-oil and gas development activity both in the U.S. and globally. Companies in our industry can be the target of opposition to hydrocarbon development. This opposition is focused on attempting to limit or stop hydrocarbon development in certain areas. Examples of such opposition include efforts to reduce access to public and private lands, restriction of exploration and production activities within government-owned and other lands, delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction, limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal, imposition of set-backs on oil and gas sites, delaying or denying air-quality or siting permits, advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity, and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm.\nOur need to incur costs associated with responding to these anti-development efforts, including legal challenges, or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to produce oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nDrilling activities require the use of water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process that we employ to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas from many reservoirs, including the Eagle Ford, requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. The effects of climate change may further exacerbate water scarcity in certain regions.\nOur inability to timely secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. In particular, regulatory focus on disposal of produced water and drilling waste through underground injection has increased because of alleged links between such injection and regional seismic impacts in disposal areas.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nOn December 15, 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other\n\u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA have allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Among other things, EPA regulations now require specified large greenhouse gas emitters in the U.S., including companies in the energy industry, to annually report those emissions. New major sources or significant modifications of existing sources of traditional air pollutants are required to obtain permits and to use best available control technology to control those emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act as a prerequisite to the development of that emissions source. In addition, sources subject to best available control technology for traditional air pollutants are now also required to use best available control technology to control significant greenhouse gas emissions. While these regulations have not to date materially affected us, such regulations may over time require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nIn May 2016, the EPA issued final regulations intended to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40% to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025. On October 20, 2016, the EPA issued final Control Techniques Guidelines for reducing smog-forming VOC emissions from existing oil and natural gas equipment and processes in certain states and areas with smog problems. The Obama-era methane regulations are currently under review by the Trump administration and a rule proposing to significantly revise and rescind these requirements was published by the EPA in August 2019. The methane regulations could affect us indirectly by affecting our customer base or by directly regulating our operations.\nIn addition, Congress has considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane that are understood to contribute to global warming. While comprehensive climate legislation will likely not be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, energy legislation and other initiatives continue to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as electric power plants, smaller sources could become subject to greenhouse gas-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations. Any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nFinally, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses, or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nTerrorist attacks aimed at energy operations could adversely affect our business.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other government action have led and may lead to further increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect these commodity markets or the financial markets used by us. In addition, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected oil and natural gas operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack (in the form of physical attacks or cyber-attacks) on our facilities, customer facilities, and the infrastructure depended upon for transportation of products, and, in some cases, those of other energy companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGeneral economic conditions could adversely affect our business and future growth.\nInstability in the global financial markets may have a material impact on our liquidity and financial condition, and we may ultimately face major challenges if conditions in the financial markets were to materially change or worsen. Our ability to access the capital markets or to borrow money may be restricted or may be more expensive at a time when we would need to raise capital, which could have an adverse effect on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and on our ability to fund our operations and capital expenditures in the future. Such economic conditions could have an impact on our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In addition, it could have an impact on the liquidity of our operating partners, resulting in delays in operations or their failure to make required payments.\nAlso, market conditions could have an impact on our oil and natural gas derivative instruments if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection, which could lead to reductions in the demand for oil and natural gas, or reductions in the prices of oil and natural gas or both, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. While the ultimate outcome and impact of changing economic conditions cannot be predicted, they may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal legislation could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effects of commodity prices, interest rates and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions, and these rules may affect both the size of positions that we may enter or the ability and willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, such changes could materially reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. While many Dodd-Frank Act regulations are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to or otherwise impacted by such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats, and other disruptions.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, as well as conduct reservoir modeling and reserve estimation for compliance reporting.\nWe are dependent on digital technologies including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees, business partners, and stockholders, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards could be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $292.4 million NOLs that we are allowed to carryforward for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our NOLs begin to expire in 2033. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by NOLs when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382 of the Code). Generally, a change in more than 50% of the ownership of a corporation\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any unused limitation may be carried forward to future taxable years. We believe that $206.2 million of our NOLs will expire unused as a result of the Section 382 limitation that resulted from a change in ownership occurring in conjunction with to our 2018 equity issuance. In addition, future ownership changes or regulatory changes could further limit our ability to utilize any NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with NOLs, this could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires that our management assess and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Although Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an annual report that addresses the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we have opted to rely on the exemptions provided in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and consequently will not be required to comply with SEC rules that implement Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until such time as we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nIn connection with the preparation of this annual report, management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 and concluded that there was a material weakness related to deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance, specifically related to the conversion of our historical financial statements from International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) to U.S. GAAP as a result of our Redomiciliation to the U.S. For additional information regarding the material weakness identified please see \u201cPart II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures\u201d of this annual report.\nIf additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, it could lead to errors in our financial reports and/or delays in our financial reporting, which could require us to restate our operating results and investors may lose confidence in our operating results, the price of our shares could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nWe might not identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls in connection with evaluating our compliance with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, we will need to expend significant resources and provide significant management oversight. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, take a significant period of time to complete and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal control.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. We expect to continue to take advantage of some or all of the available exemptions.\nRisks Related with the Redomiciliation\nThe expected benefits of the Redomiciliation may not be realized.\nWe cannot be assured that the anticipated benefits of the Redomiciliation will be achieved, particularly those subject to factors beyond our control. These factors include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we do business and the reactions of investors, analysts and Australian and U.S. taxing authorities. If events or changes in circumstances occur affecting the aforementioned factors, we may not be able to continue to realize the expected logistical and operational benefits of the Redomiciliation.\nWe have incurred additional costs as a result of the Redomiciliation and we expect to continue to do so.\nThe Redomiciliation has resulted in an increase in some of our ongoing expenses and may require us to incur some new expenses, including professional fees, to comply with applicable U.S. corporate and tax laws.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nFollowing our Redomiciliation, the trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors such as announcements of variations in our quarterly financial results and fluctuations in revenue could also cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate. Additionally, the stock markets have at times experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and might in the future affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have, in some cases, been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Further, the trading prices of publicly traded shares of companies in our industry have been particularly volatile and may be very volatile in the future. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, international currency fluctuations or political unrest, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. If the price of our common stock declines, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration will be reduced. A low price for our equity may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt capital. These factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future, we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to compliance with applicable laws and covenants under current or future credit facilities, which may restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, a return on your investment will only occur if the price of our common stock appreciates.", "PERMNO": 16306, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SNDE"}
