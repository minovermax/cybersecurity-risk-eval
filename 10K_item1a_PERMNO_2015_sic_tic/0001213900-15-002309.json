{"cik": "1091325", "company": "CHINA YIDA HOLDING, CO.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe substantial and continuing net losses, and significant on-going working capital deficit incurred in the past few years, may require us to change our business plan or even may cause us not to be able to continue our operations if sufficient funding and/or additional cash from revenues is not realized. These matters raised substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred net losses of $29,281,114 and $16,354,397 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our working capital deficits were $35.89 million and $43.04 million, respectively. Our independent auditors have indicated in its audit report for fiscal year 2014 that these matters raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred significant negative cash flows from operative activities, and continuing net losses and working capital deficits that allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on us obtaining adequate capital resources to fund operating losses until we become profitable. Management\u2019s plans to obtain additional capital resources include (1) obtaining capital from the sale of its substantial assets, (2) generating and recovery of tourism revenue, and (3) short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, stockholders or other related party(ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. If we are unable to secure additional capital, as circumstances require, or do not succeed in meeting our profit objectives we may be required to change or cease our operations.\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan for the tourism operations.\nIn 2013, we discontinued the advertisement operations as we lost a significant number of our clients due to changes in certain PRC regulations. We may make changes to our tourism business in case of competition and regulatory environment changes. We may not be able to adjust our business strategy in response to fluctuation in microeconomic condition and regulatory environment which may lead to deviation or abandonment of our business plan.\nIn order to increase our revenues, we believe we must further expand our business operations. We cannot assure you that our internal growth strategy will be successful which may result in a negative impact on our growth, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn order to maximize the potential growth in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must further expand the scope of our services in the tourism industry. One of our strategies is to grow internally through increasing the customers and locations where we promote tourism by penetrating existing markets in the PRC and entering new geographic markets in PRC as well as other parts of Asia and globally. However, many obstacles to this expansion exist, including, but not limited to, increased competition from similar businesses, international trade and tariff barriers, unexpected costs, costs associated with marketing efforts abroad and maintaining attractive foreign exchange ratios. We cannot, therefore, assure you that we will be able to successfully overcome such obstacles and establish our services in any additional markets. Our inability to implement this internal growth strategy successfully may have a negative impact on our growth, future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition to our internal growth strategy, we may grow through strategic acquisitions. We cannot assure you that our acquisition growth strategy will be successful resulting in our failure to meet growth and revenue expectations.\nWe also intend to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses in the PRC that are complementary or related in product lines and business structure to us. However, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate or to finance acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to negotiate successfully the terms of an acquisition, or, if the acquisition occurs, integrate the acquired business into our existing business. Acquisitions of businesses or other material operations may require debt financing or additional equity financing, resulting in leverage or dilution of ownership. We may not be able to secure such financing if we want to expand into other propects. Integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by diverting management away from day-to-day operations. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures.\nWe also may not be able to maintain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. In addition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings. At times, acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition. In addition to the above, acquisitions in PRC, including state owned businesses, will be required to comply with laws of the PRC, to the extent applicable. There can be no assurance that any given proposed acquisition will be able to comply with PRC requirements, rules and/or regulations, or that we will successfully obtain governmental approvals which are necessary to consummate such acquisitions, to the extent required. If our acquisition strategy is unsuccessful, we will not grow our operations and revenues at the rate that we anticipate.\nIn the event of rapid growth of our business operations, we may experience a significant strain on our management and operational infrastructure. Our failure to manage growth will cause a disruption of our operations resulting in the failure to generate revenue.\nIf we expand our business through successful implementation of our internal growth strategy and/or acquisition strategy, our management and our operational, accounting, and information infrastructure may experience a significant strain caused by such expansion. In order to deal with the strain our anticipated business expansion could put on our resources, we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures, and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate, and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect.\nIf we are not able to implement our strategies or expand our tourism operations and acquire additional tourist attractions, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nWe expanded our business in 2010 by acquiring the operation rights of additional tourist attractions under various agreements, including the City of Caves, Yang-sheng Paradise, Ming Dynasty Entertainment World and FETV. Since 2008, we have entered various agreements for Yongtai Beixi and Jiezhukou Lake, Hua\u2019an Tulou, and Yang-sheng Paradise. Our continuous business development plan is based on a further expansion of our tourism operation and acquisition of additional tourist attractions. There is inherent risks and uncertainties involved throughout these stages of development. There is no assurance that we will be successful in continuously expanding our media operations or acquiring additional tourist attractions, or that our strategies, even if implemented, will lead to the successful achievement of our objectives. If we are not able to successfully implement these further development strategies, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nTourism is a competitive business which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a competitive environment and have to compete with other tourist destinations in order to attract visitors. In order to be successful in attracting visitors or customers we may be forced to lower prices or spend more money on advertising to continue to compete with our competitors. These competitive measures may result in lower net income.\nEconomic crisis or turmoil, or suppression on individual rights may cause a downturn in china\u2019s tourism industry.\nA downturn in the world economic markets, or just the Chinese economy, may have a negative impact on our business. Consumers with a lack of disposable incomes may decide not to vacation or travel to our tourism destinations, which would negatively impact our business. Additionally, the perceived suppression of individual rights by the Chinese government may deter tourists from visiting China, which may cause a decline in visitors to our attraction.\nOur business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce the visits of our resorts and destinations\nPoor or unusual weather conditions, can significantly affect the visits of the tourists to our resorts and destinations. Insufficient levels of rain or drought can cause significant affect to our tourist destination. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also reduce tourists\u2019 volume. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on our tourism business. In the second half of 2010, we had to close part of our tourist destination in Great Golden Lake due to flooding, as a result we had reduced revenue.\nThe slow recovery of the global economic crisis could affect the overall availability and cost of external financing for our operations.\nThe slow recovery of the global financial markets from the global economic crisis and turmoil may adversely impact our business, the business and financial condition of our customers and the business of potential investors from whom we expect to generate our potential sources of capital financing. Presently it is unclear to what extent the economic stimulus measures and other actions taken or contemplated by the Chinese governments and other governments throughout the world will mitigate the effects of the negative impact caused by the economic turmoil on our industry and other industries that affect our business. Although these conditions have not presently impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, the impact of the current crisis on our ability to obtain capital financing in the future, and the cost and terms of same, is unclear.\nWe have not yet contracted with local governments and may be unable to continue our land use rights from the government for our tourism development as we currently do which could negatively impact our ability to continue to operate our tourist destinations\nOur business and our revenue depend on the operation of our tourist destinations, which in turn depends on our ability to acquire and continue to use land the land from the PRC government whether by lease or by land use right. We have obtained certain land use rights for Yunding Park, Yang-sheng Paradise, Ming Dynasty Entertainment World, and City of Caves. We currently have operated 3 tourist destinations: (i) Great Golden Lake, (ii) Yunding Park, and (iii) Hua\u2019an Tulou. For the 3 operating tourist destinations, with the exception of the Yunding Park, we have not yet entered into contracts with local governments for the land-use rights for Great Golden Lake and Hua\u2019an Tulou. With respect to the Yunding Park, our land use rights include 130,513 square meters for scenic views, hotels and restaurant and entertainment. The term is for 40 years beginning on August 9, 2010 and ending on August 9, 2050 for a total payment of 12,805,000RMB (or approximately $2,033,000). A copy of the State-Owned Land Use Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.26. With respect to the Great Golden Lake and Tulou, we have obtained the management and operating rights on the land, although we have not obtained the land-use rights. It is not required to obtain the land-use rights in order to operate on the land. The Company\u2019s 3 new projects, Ming Dynasty Entertainment World, Yang-sheng Paradise and City of Caves are currently under construction. We have already obtained certain land use rights for these 3 new projects, and the Company will continue to obtain additional land-use rights under the agreements entered into with local governments for all of our properties.\nPursuant to PRC laws, the assignment of land-use rights is the responsibility of local government. The size, location, purpose of usage, term and other conditions under assignment of land use right shall be planned by local land administration departments in conjunction with a number of governmental administrative departments such as urban planning, construction and the housing administration. In addition, such plan shall be submitted to the proper authorities for approval according to authorizations granted and stipulated by PRC State Council. After that, the local land administration departments may implement the arrangements for the assignment of land use right. If, however, at any time the local governments seek to terminate our land-use rights, we may be unable to operate our tourist destinations and will be forced to close down our attractions.\nThe maximum term of land use right usually is decided by its purpose of usage, e.g. 70 years term of land for residence, 50 years term of land for industrial use, 40 years term of land for commerce, tourism and recreation, 50 years term of land for comprehensive purpose. Such term commonly will be decided by the government.\nThe process for obtaining the land-use right is lengthy and we have not completed it for any of the locations that we operate except for the land use rights that we obtained from Yongtai County Municipal Bureau of Land and Resources. Our agreements with the local PRC governments who have not yet granted us land-use rights does not set forth all details for assignment of land use right and most of the lands are subject to governmental internal procedure.\nAlthough we believe that the local PRC government will not terminate our right to manage the land before we are able to obtain land-use agreements with each property, we cannot assure you that the local government will continue to honor the understandings that we have with each local PRC government. We are not able to own land in the PRC, we can only lease it from the PRC government. At the end of any land-use rights agreements with local PRC governments, the land will return to the government and we will not receive any reimbursement or reward.\nIf we are unsuccessful in obtaining land-use rights for each property, it is possible that the local PRC government may require us to leave the property and we would lose all rights to the construction, buildings and improvements we have made on the land. However, not having land-use rights does not prohibit us from operating our tourism destinations at those locations. We can still obtain the right to manage and operate on the land.\nWe may not be able to continually manage and operate our tourism development and the termination of revenue sharing agreements will negatively impact our financial conditions and revenues.\nIf the land use agreements are terminated, then we will have to cease our tourism business if we cannot renew the agreements. According to tourism development and revenue sharing agreement in respect to Great Golden Lake Resort, the agreement may be terminated before its expiration in case that (i) the purpose of contract is failed due to the material breach of defaulting party or (ii) the occurrence of force majeure. When any above events for termination occurs, the contractual parties shall terminate agreement through friendly negotiation or by initiating a legal proceeding. The termination of revenue sharing agreements will negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. We rely on ticket sales to pay off the loans on the property.\nWe depend on our key management personnel and the loss of their services could adversely affect our business.\nWe place substantial reliance upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers, Mr. Minhua Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ms. Yanling Fan, our Vice President of Operations. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, revenues or prospects. We do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of these individuals. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management on acceptable terms in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel in our industry and as a result, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe require various licenses to operate our business, and the loss of or failure to renew any or all of these licenses could require us to suspend some or all of our operations. Also, the loss or misappropriation of the corporate chops, seals, or other controlling non-tangible assets of our PRC subsidiaries might delay or disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenues.\nIn accordance with PRC laws and regulations, we are required to maintain various licenses in order to operate our business. The loss, suspension, or failure to renew our business licenses could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our operations. We also keep the business licenses, corporate seal s, chops or other controlling nontangible assets under the Company\u2019s Administration Department. Our staff in the Administration Department are responsible to do the document recording and for the use of the corporate seals. The corporate seals and licenses can only be used based on management\u2019s written approval. If we lose the business license, corporate seal and other related documents, the Company may have to file with local government for re-issuance of such documents which could delay or disrupt our operations and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe may never pay any dividends to shareholders and we are a holding company that is dependent on receiving dividends or other distributions from our operating subsidiaries and variable interest entities, of which the operating subsidiaries are located in the PRC.\nWe have never paid any dividends. Our board of directors does not intend to distribute dividends in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.\nWe are a holding company and our operating subsidiaries and variable interest entity are entirely located and operate in the People\u2019s Republic of China. There are significant restrictions on dividends and distributions from companies located and operating in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Foreign exchange is regulated as well. The government needs to approve any dividends, payments or distributions to any offshore entity or company not located in the People\u2019s Republic of China. In the last two fiscal years, we have not received any dividends, payments or distributions from any subsidiary or VIE located or operating in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nWe do not carry any business interruption insurance, product liability or recall insurance or third-party liability insurance.\nOperation of our business and facilities involves many risks, including natural disasters, labor disturbances, business interruptions, property damage, personal injury and death. We do not carry any business interruption insurance or third-party liability insurance for our business to cover claims in respect of personal injury or property or environmental damage arising from accidents on our property or relating to our operations. Therefore, we may not have insurance coverage sufficient to cover all risks associated with our business. As a result, we may be required to pay for financial and other losses, damages and liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control, out of our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement exercises significant control over matters requiring shareholder approval which may result in the delay or prevention of a change in our control.\nMr. Minhua Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, through his common stock ownership, currently has voting power equal to approximately 28.81% of our voting securities. Ms. Yanling Fan, our Vice President of Operations and the spouse of Mr. Minhua Chen, through her common stock ownership, currently has voting power equal to approximately 28.70% of our voting securities. Mr. Minhua Chen and Ms. Yanling Fan are married and have combined voting power in our Company equal to approximately 57.51% of our voting securities. As a result, management through such stock ownership exercises significant control over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership in management may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us that may be otherwise viewed as beneficial by shareholders other than management.\nWe may incur significant costs to ensure compliance with United States corporate governance and accounting requirements.\nWe may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. Even though we have been a reporting company since 1999, this risk applies to us because we completed a share exchange with Keenway Limited in 2007 whereby a Chinese operating company became our wholly owned subsidiary. This Chinese operating company is newly reporting and we are adjusting to the increased disclosure requirements for us to comply with corporate governance and accounting requirements.\nIn our experience, we expect to incur approximately $157,000 per year in additional costs to ensure compliance with all corporate governance and accounting requirements. These costs consist of: (i) internal control and U.S. GAAP reporting consulting services: $97,000 and (ii) Legal fees: $60,000.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud may be adversely affected and investor confidence and the market price of our common shares may be adversely impacted.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports, including Form 10-K. Our management may conclude that our internal controls over our financial reporting are not effective. If our management concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, it might result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of such financial statements.\nOn May 20, 2010, BDO Li Xin Da Hua was appointed as our independent auditors but never completed any interim review of our financial statements or issued any audit report on our financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure and subsequently resigned on August 8, 2010. The reason for BDO Li Xin Da Hua\u2019s resignation was that they identified that the Company lacked a good system of internal controls, such as inadequate documentation for certain transactions and lack of competent and well trained personnel to furnish U.S. GAAP based reporting documents to be filed.\nWe took a series of remediation measures plan to to cure the lacks of internal controls: Although we have rectified the lack of internal controls issue and hired external consultant as a measure to improve our internal controls and strengthen our financial reporting, it is possible that our current auditor may conclude that our controls over financial reporting are not effective which could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of such financial statements.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal controls and financial reporting and our lack of a chief financial officer with sufficient U.S. GAAP experience may limit our ability to prevent or detect financial misstatements or omissions. As a result, our financial reports may not be in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Any material weakness, misstatement or omission in our financial statements will negatively affect the market and the price of our stock which could result in significant loss to our investors.\nNone of the members of our current management has experience managing and operating a public company, and they rely in many instances on the professional experience and advice of third parties. While we are obligated to hire a qualified chief financial officer to enable us to satisfy our reporting obligations as a U.S. public company, we do not have a chief financial officer with any significant U.S. GAAP experience presently. Although we are actively seeking such a chief financial officer, qualified individuals are often difficult to find, or the individual may not have all of the qualifications that we require. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience \u201cweakness\u201d and potential problems in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d Act of 2002. This \u201cweakness\u201d also includes a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such requirements are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to include in our annual reports our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal years. We have determined that our internal controls and procedures are not effective due to the lack of U.S. GAAP experience from our management.\nWe may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock.\nIn recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performances, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control. If our business development plans are successful, we may require additional financing to continue to develop and exploit existing and new products and services related to our industries and to expand into new markets. The exploitation of our services may, therefore, be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means.\nWe have a contractual relationship with Fujian Jiaoguang which may be in non-compliance with PRC laws and does not provide the same operational control as a direct equity interest.\nOur contractual relationship with Fujian Jiaoguang was structured as a contractual relationship as opposed to a direct equity interest in order to comply with PRC law. We have received a PRC legal counsel attesting that this structure is in compliance with the PRC law. However, the PRC law may be subject to change or the government may review the structure and determine that this contractual relationship is not in compliance with PRC laws and force the termination of this relationship. Additionally, the contractual relationship between us and Fujian Jiaoguang does not provide us with the same operational control as a direct equity interest. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with contractual rights as opposed to owning the company. Such risks could include breach of contract or failure to honor the terms of the contract. In the event that we are not unable to maintain effective control of this entity, we would not be able to continue to consolidate our financial results. However, these risks are mitigated by the fact that the shareholders of Fujian Jiaoguang are Chairman Minhua Chen and Ms. Yanling Fan who are also our majority shareholders.\nFujian Jiaoguang has transferred all its operations to our wholly-owned subsidiaries and no longer contributes any revenue to us. All the revenue we have realized from this entity is not realized directly from our wholly-owned subsidiary. Although Fujian Jiaoguang is no longer generating revenues, it continues to incur expenses to maintain its business status as a corporate entity. Fujiang Jiaoguang has current assets and liabilities because it is acting as an intercompany to transfer funds from and to the Company\u2019s directly-owned subsidiaries, which resulted in part of the intercompany receivables and payables. Fujian Jiaoguang is a variable interest entity subject to consolidation into the Company and fully controlled by the Company\u2019s management. Therefore, expenses incurred at Fujian Jiaoguang had been included in the Company\u2019s audited consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. As a result of Fujian Jiaoguang being a variable interest entity instead of a directly owned subsidiary, you may face increased risks associated with the possession, security and control over the chops for this entity and control over the individuals who may have access to its bank accounts.\nRisks Relating to the People's Republic of China\nSubstantially all of our operating assets are located in China and substantially all of our revenue will be derived from our operations in china so our business, results of operations and prospects are subject to the economic, political and legal policies, developments and conditions in china.\nThe PRC\u2019s economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, could impair our business. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects. China\u2019s GDP has grown consistently since 1978 (National Bureau of Statistics of China). However, we cannot assure you that such growth will be sustained in the future. If, in the future, China\u2019s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could impair our ability to remain profitable. The PRC\u2019s economic growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be hindered by PRC government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations.\nThe PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the use of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the PRC government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over PRC economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nThere are significant uncertainties under the Draft Foreign Investment Law relating to the status of businesses in China controlled by foreign invested enterprises primarily through contractual arrangements, such as our business.\nOn January 19, 2015, MOFCOM published a draft of the PRC Law on Foreign Investment (Draft for Comment), or the Draft Foreign Investment Law, which is open for public comments until February 17, 2015. At the same time, MOFCOM published an accompanying explanatory note of the Draft Foreign Investment Law, or the Explanatory Note, which contains important information about the Draft Foreign Investment Law, including its drafting philosophy and principles, main content, plans to transition to the new legal regime and treatment of business in China controlled by foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, primarily through contractual arrangements. The Draft FIL utilizes the concept of \u201cactual control\u201d for determining whether an entity is considered to be a foreign-invested enterprise, and defines \u201ccontrol\u201d broadly to include, among other things, voting or board control through contractual arrangements.\nThe Draft Foreign Investment Law proposes significant changes to the PRC foreign investment legal regime and may have a material impact on Chinese companies listed or to be listed overseas. The proposed Draft Foreign Investment Law is to regulate FIEs the same way as PRC domestic entities, except for those FIEs that operate in industries deemed to be either \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d in a \u201cNegative List.\u201d Because the Negative List has yet to be published, it is unclear whether it will differ from the current list of industries subject to restrictions or prohibitions on foreign investment. The Draft Foreign Investment Law also provides that only FIEs operating in industries on the Negative List will require entry clearance and other approvals that are not required of PRC domestic entities. As a result of the entry clearance and approvals, certain FIE\u2019s operating in industries on the Negative List may not be able to continue to conduct their operations through contractual arrangements. It states that entities established in China but controlled by foreign investors will be treated as foreign-invested enterprises, while entities set up outside of China which are controlled by PRC persons or entities, would be treated as domestic enterprises after completion of market entry procedures.\nThere is substantial uncertainty regarding the Draft Foreign Investment Law, including, among others, what the actual content of the law will be as well as the adoption and effective date of the final form of the law. While such uncertainty exists, we cannot assure you that the new foreign investment law, when it is adopted and becomes effective, will not have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business through our contractual arrangements.\nIf the ministry of finance and commerce, or MOFCOM, China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, or another PRC regulatory agency, determines that MOFCOM and CSRC approval of our merger was required or if other regulatory obligations are imposed upon us, we may incur sanctions, penalties or additional costs which would damage our business.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the MOFCOM and the CSRC, promulgated the Rules on Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, regulations with respect to the mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors that became effective on September 8, 2006. Article 11 of the M&A Rules requires PRC companies, enterprises or natural persons to obtain MOFCOM approval in order to effectuate mergers or acquisitions between PRC companies and foreign companies legally established or controlled by such PRC companies, enterprises or natural persons. Article 40 of the M&A Rules requires that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for overseas listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals should obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such offshore special purpose vehicle\u2019s securities on an overseas stock exchange, especially in the event that the offshore special purpose vehicle acquires shares of or equity interests in the PRC companies in exchange for the shares of offshore companies. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures and filing requirements for offshore special purpose vehicles seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings.\nOn November 19, 2007, we completed a merger transaction pursuant to a share exchange and stock purchase agreement, which resulted in our current ownership and corporate structure. We believe, based on the opinion of our PRC legal counsel, Allbright Law Offices, that MOFCOM and CSRC approvals were not required for our merger transaction or for the listing and trading of our securities on a trading market because we are not an offshore special purpose vehicle that is directly or indirectly controlled by PRC companies or individuals. Although the merger and acquisition regulations provide specific requirements and procedures, there are still many ambiguities in the meaning of many provisions. Further regulations are anticipated in the future, but until there has been clarification either by pronouncements, regulation or practice, there is some uncertainty in the scope of the regulations and the regulators have wide latitude in the enforcement of the regulations and approval of transactions. If the MOFCOM, CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that the MOFCOM and CSRC approvals were required, we may face sanctions by the MOFCOM, CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency. If this happens, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our operating privileges in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of proceeds into China, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends paid by Fujian Jintai Tourism, or take other actions that could damage our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our securities. It is uncertain at this time to determine what, if any, fines or penalties would be imposed for failure to obtain the necessary approvals because Circular 10 does not expressly provide any provision with respect to fines or penalties and there has been no information provided or published precedent established to indicate what the fines or penalties would be.\nCircular 10 mainly governs the foreign investors acquisition and merger of Chinese domestic enterprises, including (a) the acquisition of the equities of PRC domestic non-foreign funded enterprises by foreign investors; (b) the subscription of the increased capital of a PRC domestic company by foreign investors; and (c) the incorporation of a foreign-funded enterprise by foreign investors by purchasing the operating assets of a PRC domestic enterprise. We do not believe that Circular 10 is applicable to us because: (i) Fujian Jintai Tourism was incorporated as foreign-funded enterprise on October 19, 2011, with the approval of local Department of Commerce and Administration for Industry and Commerce. There was no acquisition of the equities or assets of a \u201cPRC domestic company\u201d as such term is defined under the new M&A Rules; (ii) Both Fujian Jintai Tourism and Hong Kong Yi Tat were incorporated prior to the implementation of Circular 10; (iii) Hong Kong Yi Tat was incorporated for the purpose of operating or holding the equity of Fujian Jintai Tourism; (iv) there is no provision in Circular 10 that clearly classifies contractual arrangements as a type of transaction subject to regulation; and (v) CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether overseas share exchange like the Company\u2019s are subject to this regulation.\nThe M&A Regulations establish more complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisition in China.\nThe M&A Regulations establish additional procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign investors, such as ours, more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the approval of the Ministry of Commerce shall be required for transactions involving the shares of an offshore listed company being used as the acquisition consideration by foreign investors. In the future, we may grow our business in part by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the M&A Regulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nIf the PRC imposes restrictions designed to reduce inflation, future economic growth in the PRC could be severely curtailed which could hurt our business and profitability.\nWhile the economy of the PRC has experienced rapid growth, this growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth often can lead to growth in the supply of money and rising inflation. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. Imposition of similar restrictions may lead to a slowing of economic growth, a decrease in travel among the population and less visitors to our tourist attractions.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could harm our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our ordinary shares will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB will affect the relative purchasing power of these proceeds, our balance sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future. Since July 2005, the RMB has not been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.\nExchange controls that exist in the PRC may limit our ability to utilize our cash flow effectively.\nWe are subject to the PRC\u2019s rules and regulations on currency conversion. In the PRC, the State Administration for Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, regulates the conversion between Renminbi and foreign currencies. Currently, foreign investment enterprises, or FIEs, are required to apply to the SAFE for \u201cForeign Exchange Registration Certificates for FIEs.\u201d As a result of our ownership of Fujian Jintai Tourism, Fujian Jintai Tourism is a FIE and is only able to use the proceeds from any foreign currency-dominated capital for the daily operation of the subsidiary and for the construction of the tourism destinations or for the purpose that is described on the loan agreement documentation. With such registration certificates, which need to be renewed annually, FIEs are allowed to open foreign currency accounts including a \u201ccurrent account\u201d and \u201ccapital account.\u201d Currency conversion within the scope of the \u201ccurrent account,\u201d such as remittance of foreign currencies for payment of dividends, can be effected without requiring the approval of the SAFE. However, conversion of currency in the \u201ccapital account,\u201d including capital items such as direct foreign investment, loans and securities, still require approval of the SAFE. Further, any capital contributions to Fujian Jintai Tourism by its offshore shareholder must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce in China or its local counterpart. We have obtained such approval but cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will not impose further restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi or revoke our government approval at any time in the future. Any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use our cash flow for the distribution of dividends to our shareholders or to fund operations it may have outside of the PRC.\nIn August 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by FIEs of foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. Circular 142 requires that Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC unless specifically provided for otherwise. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of Renminbi funds converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE. The use of such Renminbi may not be changed without approval from SAFE, and may not be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. Violations of Circular 142 may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the SAFE rules. Accordingly, Fujian Jintai Tourism is only able to use the proceeds from any foreign currency-dominated capital for the daily operation of the subsidiary and for the construction of the tourism destinations or for the purpose that is described on the loan agreement documentation.\nPRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from using the cash flows to make loans or additional capital contribution to our PRC operating subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nIn utilizing our cash flow, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to the PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and to our affiliated PRC entities only through loans, in each case subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In the event that we are prevented from using the funds to fund the operation of our PRC subsidiaries, we will use our best efforts to obtain the required approvals, however, we may not be able to utilize the funds in the event that the PRC laws and regulations do not permit it.\nIn utilizing our cash flow, we, as an offshore holding company of our PRC operating subsidiaries, may use the cash flow to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. Any loans to our PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example, loans by us to finance the activities of our PRC subsidiary, which is a foreign-invested enterprise, cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its local counterpart, and the accumulative amount of foreign currency loans will not exceed the difference between the total investment and the registered capital of our PRC subsidiary, which is a foreign-invested enterprise.\nWe may also decide to finance our PRC subsidiary by means of capital contributions. Any additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which are foreign-invested enterprises, must be approved by the MOFCOM.\nWe cannot assure you that we can obtain the necessary government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries.\nRegulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our ability to acquire PRC companies and could adversely affect our business.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration Over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents Via Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, which replaced Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 75. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. Circular 37 further requires amendment to a PRC resident\u2019s registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as an increase or decrease in the capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents\u2019 failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the SAFE registration requirements could result in penalties under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange regulations.\nAs Circular 37 is newly-issued, it is unclear how these regulations will be interpreted and implemented. In addition, different local SAFE branches may have different views and procedures as to the interpretation and implementation of the SAFE regulations, and it may be difficult for our ultimate shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents to provide sufficient supporting documents required by the SAFE or to complete the required registration with the SAFE in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure by any of our shareholders who is a PRC resident, or is controlled by a PRC resident, to comply with relevant requirements under these regulations could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the PRC government, including restrictions on WFOE\u2019s ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us and on our ability to increase our investment in the WFOE.\nRequirement of statutory reserve of certain amount of our net income pursuant to PRC regulation may further restrict our PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entity\u2019s ability to distribute profits to us and have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, our subsidiaries in China, as wholly foreign-owned enterprises, are respectively required to set aside at least 10% of their accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of fund set aside reaches 50% of the registered capital of each of the entities. These reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends. It is unclear that if and what fine or penalties that a company may be subject to as a result of noncompliance of such requirement. As of December 31, 2013, each of our subsidiaries subject to the statutory reserve requirement has set aside 50% of its registered capital of the subsidiaries. Such statutory requirement could limit our subsidiaries and variable interest entity ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us and could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow that could be beneficial to our business, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nFujian Yida Travel Service Co., Ltd. was formed on June 24, 2011 and there was a capital contribution made of 10 million RMB (approximately $1,570,000) which is 100% of its registered capital. No portion of this capital contribution was used to fund its statutory reserve fund because there is no need for Fujian Yida Travel Service Co., Ltd. to allocate any statutory reserve fund until it realizes a profit.\nAny outbreak of widespread public health problem in the PRC could adversely affect our operations.\nThere have been recent outbreaks of contagious disease such as bird flu (avian influenza), caused by the H7N9 virus, in certain parts of China, where all of our facilities are located and where all of our sales occur. Our business is dependent upon our ability to attract a large volume of visitors to our tourism destinations, and an outbreak of widespread public health problem in China, could have a negative effect on our operations. Any such outbreak could have an impact on our operations as a result of:\n\u00b7 quarantines or closures of our tourist destinations\n\u00b7 the sickness or death of our key officers and employees, and\n\u00b7 a general slowdown in the Chinese economy.\nAny of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could adversely affect our operations.\nBecause Chinese law governs many of our material agreements, we may not be able to enforce our rights within the PRC or elsewhere, which could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.\nChinese law governs many of our material agreements, some of which may be with Chinese governmental agencies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce any of our material agreements or that remedies will be available outside of the PRC. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws and contracts in the PRC may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The Chinese judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing corporate and commercial law, leading to a higher than usual degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.\nBecause our funds are held in banks in uninsured PRC bank accounts, the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business.\nFunds on deposit at banks and other financial institutions in the PRC are often uninsured. A significant portion of our assets are in the form of cash deposited with banks in the PRC, and in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to our funds on deposit. Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to our cash could impair our operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business.\nOur business could be severely harmed if the Chinese government changes its policies, laws, regulations, tax structure or its current interpretations of its laws, rules and regulations relating to our operations in china.\nOur business is located in Fujian, China and virtually all of our assets are located in China. We generate our sales revenue only from customers located in China. Our results of operations, financial state of affairs and future growth are, to a significant degree, subject to China\u2019s economic, political and legal development and related uncertainties. Our operations and results could be materially affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to\n\u00b7 Changes in policies by the Chinese government resulting in changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation of laws or regulations,\n\u00b7 changes in taxation,\n\u00b7 changes in employment restrictions,\n\u00b7 import duties, and\n\u00b7 currency revaluation.\nOver the past several years, the Chinese government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activities and greater economic decentralization. If the Chinese government does not continue to pursue its present policies that encourage foreign investment and operations in China, or if these policies are either not successful or are significantly altered, then our business could be harmed. Following the Chinese government\u2019s policy of privatizing many state-owned enterprises, the Chinese government has attempted to augment its revenues through increased tax collection. It also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Continued efforts to increase tax revenues could result in increased taxation expenses being incurred by us. Economic development may be limited as well by the imposition of austerity measures intended to reduce inflation, the inadequate development of infrastructure and the potential unavailability of adequate power and water supplies, transportation and communications. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry by imposing industrial policies.\nThe Chinese laws and regulations which govern our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain and may be changed in a way that hurts our business.\nChina\u2019s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes, in which system decided legal cases have little value as precedents, unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of Chinese laws and regulations, including but not limited to the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy and criminal proceedings. The Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We are considered an FIE under Chinese laws, and as a result, we must comply with Chinese laws and regulations. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new Chinese laws or regulations may have on our business. If the relevant authorities find us to be in violation of Chinese laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, without limitation: levying fines; revoking our business and other licenses; requiring that we restructure our ownership or operations; and requiring that we discontinue any portion or all of our business.\nA slowdown or other adverse developments in the Chinese economy may materially and adversely affect our customers\u2019 demand for our services and our business.\nAll of our operations are conducted in China and all of our revenues are generated from sales to businesses operating in China. Although the Chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years, such growth may not continue. We do not know how sensitive we are to a slowdown in economic growth or other adverse changes in Chinese economy which may affect demand for precision steel products. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in China may materially reduce the demand for our services and in turn reduce our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. foreign corrupt practices act and Chinese anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nOur executive officers, employees and other agents may violate applicable law in connection with the marketing or sale of our products, including China\u2019s anti-corruption laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. However, corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in the PRC.\nWhile we intend to implement measures to ensure compliance with the FCPA and Chinese anti-corruption laws by all individuals involved with our company, our employees or other agents may engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our brand and reputation, our sales activities or the price of our ordinary shares could be adversely affected if we become the target of any negative publicity as a result of actions taken by our employees or other agents.\nWe have not had, and do not intend to have, any current or historic experience with non-compliance with FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws.\nThe implementation of the new PRC labor contract law and increases in the labor costs in china may hurt our business and profitability.\nA new labort contract law became effective on January 1, 2008 in China. It imposes more stringent requirements on employers in relation to entry into fixed-term labort contracts, recruitment of temporary employees and dismissal of employees. In addition, under the newly promulgated Regulations on Paid Annual Leave for Employees, which also became effective on January 1, 2008, employees who have worked continuously for more than one year are entitled to paid vacation ranging from 5 to 15 days, depending on the length of the employee\u2019s service. Employees who waive such vacation entitlements at the request of the employer will be compensated for three times their normal daily salaries for each vacation day so waived. As a result of the new law and regulations, our labor costs may increase. There is no assurance that disputes, work stoppages or strikes will not arise in the future. Increases in the labor costs or future disputes with our employees could damage our business, financial condition or operating results.\nUnder the current EIT Law, China Yida and Hong Kong Yi Tat may be classified as \u201cresident enterprises\u201d of China, which may subject China Yida and Hong Kong Yi Tat to PRC income tax on their taxable global income.\nChina passed an Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementation regulations, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise. On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation with respect to non-Chinese enterprises or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a \u201cnon-domestically incorporated resident enterprise\u201d if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be generally subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate as to its worldwide income. Although the Notice is directly applicable to enterprises registered in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by Chinese domestic enterprises or groups, it is uncertain whether the PRC tax authorities will make reference to the Notice when determining the resident status of other offshore companies, such as Fujian Jin Tai. Since substantially all of our management is currently based in China, it is likely we may be treated as a Chinese resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The tax consequences of such treatment are currently unclear, as they will depend on how local tax authorities apply or enforce the EIT Law or the implementation regulations.\nIn addition, under the EIT Law and implementation regulations, PRC income tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are \u201cnon-resident enterprises\u201d (and that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business) to the extent that such dividends have their source within the PRC unless there is an applicable tax treaty between the PRC and the jurisdiction in which an overseas holder resides which reduces or exempts the relevant tax. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of shares by such investors is also subject to the 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC.\nIf we are considered a PRC \u201cresident enterprise\u201d, it is unclear whether the dividends we pay with respect to our shares, or the gain you may realize from the transfer of our shares, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax. If we are required under the EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our foreign shareholders, or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of your shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing with the NASDAQ, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. Investors in penny stocks should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment.\nOur failure to meet the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nIf after listing we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements and the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock, which could impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nOur common stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 93190, "SIC": 7996, "TIC": "CNYD"}
