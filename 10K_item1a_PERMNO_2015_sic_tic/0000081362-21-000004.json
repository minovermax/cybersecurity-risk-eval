results of operations, including the following\nrisks relating to: (1) the\ndemand for our products and services and our ability\nto grow our customer base; (2) our business operations, including\ninternal and\nexternal factors that may impact our operational\ncontinuity; (3) our international operations; (4) our supply chain\n;\n(5) domestic and\nforeign taxation and government regulation and oversight;\nand (6) more general risk factors that may impact our business.\nRisks Related to the Demand for our Products\nand Services and our Customer Base\nChanges to the industries and markets that we serve could\nhave a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and\nresults of operations.\nAs a leader in industrial process fluids, the Company\nis subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by our\ncustomers\nthat participate in the steel, automobile, aircraft, industrial\nequipment, aerospace, aluminum and durable goods industries.\nBecause\ndemand for our products and services is largely\nderived from the global demand for their products, we are subject\nto uncertainties\nrelated to downturns in our customers\u2019 businesses and unanticipated\nshutdowns or curtailments of our customers\u2019 production,\nincluding as a result of adverse changes affecting\nnational, regional and global economies or increased competitive\npressure within our\ncustomers\u2019\nindustries.\nFor example, our business was adversely affected by the\nproduction slowdown of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft\nthat occurred in 2020.\nOur customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash\nflow shortages and difficulty obtaining\nfinancing, leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase\nproducts, and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations\nin a timely\nfashion.\nWe have limited ability to\nadjust our costs contemporaneously with changes in sales; thus,\na significant sudden downturn in\nsales due to reductions in global production within the industries we\nserve and/or weak end-user markets could have a\nmaterial\nadverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nFurther, our suppliers and other business partners\nmay\nexperience similar conditions, which could impact their\nability to fulfill their obligations to us and also result in material\nadverse\neffects on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nChanges in competition in the industries and markets we serve\ncould have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial\nposition and results of operations.\nThe specialty chemical industry is highly competitive\nand there are many companies with significant financial resources\nand/or\ncustomer relationships that compete with us to provide\nsimilar products and services.\nSome competitors may be able to offer more\nfavorable or flexible pricing and service terms or,\ndue to their larger size or greater access to resources,\nmay be better able to adapt to\nchanges in conditions in our industries, fluctuations\nin the costs of raw materials or changes in global economic conditions,\npotentially\nresulting in reduced profitability and/or a loss of market\nshare for us.\nThe pricing decisions of our competitors could lead us to\ndecrease our prices which could negatively affect\nour margins and profitability.\nIn addition, our competitors could potentially\nconsolidate their businesses to gain scale to better position\ntheir product offerings, which could have a negative\nimpact on our\nprofitability and market share.\nCompetition in our industry historically has also been\nbased on the ability to provide products that\nmeet the needs of the customer and render technical\nservices and laboratory assistance, which our competitors may be\nable to\naccomplish more effectively than we are\nable to do.\nFurther, in connection with obtaining regulatory\napproval of the Combination, we\ndivested certain of Houghton\u2019s products\nand related assets to a competitor which they may use to compete\nwith us in certain areas\nwhere we continue to sell those products.\nIf we are unsuccessful with differentiating ourselves, it could\nhave a material adverse effect\non our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations and we could lose\nmarket share to our competitors.\nLoss of a significant customer,\nbankruptcy of a major customer,\nor the closure of or significant reduction in production at a\ncustomer site could have a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial position and\nresults of operations.\nDuring 2020, the Company\u2019s\ntop five largest customers (each composed of multiple\nsubsidiaries or divisions with semi-\nautonomous purchasing authority) together accounted\nfor approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales, with the\nlargest customer\naccounting for approximately 3% of our consolidated\nnet sales.\nThe loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse\neffect\non our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nAlso, a significant portion of our revenues is derived from\nsales to\ncustomers in the cyclical steel, aerospace, aluminum\nand automotive industries where bankruptcies have occurred\nin the past and\nwhere companies have periodically experienced financial\ndifficulties.\nIf a significant customer experiences financial difficulties\nor\nfiles for bankruptcy protection, we may be unable to collect\non our receivables, and customer manufacturing sites may\nbe closed or\ncontracts voided.\nThe bankruptcy of a major customer could therefore have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial\nposition and results of operations.\nAlso, some of our customers, primarily in the steel, aluminum\nand aerospace industries, often have\nfewer manufacturing locations compared to other metalworking\ncustomers and generally use higher volumes of products at\na single\nlocation.\nThe loss, closure or significant reduction in production at one or more\nof these locations or other major sites of a significant\ncustomer could have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nWe may not\nbe able to timely develop, manufacture and gain market acceptance\nof new and enhanced products required to\nmaintain or expand our business, which could adversely affect\nour competitive position and our liquidity, financial\nposition and\nresults of operations.\nWe believe that\nour continued success depends on our ability to continuously\ndevelop and manufacture new products and product\nenhancements on a timely and cost-effective\nbasis in response to customer demands for higher performance\nprocess chemicals and\nother product offerings.\nOur competitors may develop new products or enhancements to\ntheir products that offer performance,\nfeatures and lower prices that may render our products less competitive\nor obsolete, and we may lose business and/or significant\nmarket share.\nThe development and commercialization of new products requires\nsignificant expenditures over an extended period of\ntime, and some products that we seek to develop may\nfail to gain traction or never become profitable.\nIn any event, ongoing\ninvestments in research and development for the future\ndo not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating\nresults and\ntherefore could result in higher costs without a proportional\nincrease in revenues.\nIn addition, our customers use our specialty chemicals for\na broad range of applications.\nChanges in our customers\u2019 products or\nprocesses or changes in regulatory,\nlegislative or industry requirements may lead our customers to reduce\nconsumption of the specialty\nchemicals that we produce or make them unnecessary\nor less attractive.\nCustomers may also adopt alternative materials or processes\nthat do not require our products.\nAn example of such evolving customer demands and\nindustry trends is the movement towards light\nweighting of materials and electric vehicles.\nShould a customer decide to use a different material due\nto price, performance or other\nconsiderations, we may not be able to supply a product that\nmeets the customer\u2019s new requirements.\nConsequently, it is important\nthat\nwe develop new products to replace the products that\nmature and decline in use.\nDespite our efforts, we may not be able to develop\nand introduce products incorporating new technologies in a\ntimely manner that will satisfy our customers\u2019 future needs or achieve\nmarket acceptance.\nMoreover, new products may have\nlower margins than the products they replace.\nOur business, results of\noperations, cash flows and margins could\nbe materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage\nsuccessfully the maturation or\nobsolescence of our existing products and the introduction\nof new products.\nRisks Related to Business Operations, Including Internal\nand External Factors that May Impact Our Operational\nContinuity\nOur ability to profitably operate our consolidated company\nas anticipated requires us to effectively complete\nthe integration of our\nconsolidated operations.\nAn inability to appropriately capitalize on growth, including organic\ngrowth and future acquisitions,\ncould adversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nCompleting the integration of the combined Quaker Houghton\npresents the Company with significant risks, which may affect\nour\nability to achieve expected cost synergies or\nexpand our combined business into new markets and geographies.\nThese risks include,\namong others:\n\u25cf\nthe diversion of management time and focus from operating\nour business to address challenges that may arise in the\ncontinued integration of Houghton;\n\u25cf\nthe transition of further operations and customers of Houghton\nto the combined business, including across different\ncultures\nand languages, and the need to address the particular economic,\ncurrency, political, and\nregulatory risks associated with\nspecific countries;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to realize anticipated operational or financial\nsynergies;\n\u25cf\ndelays in the implementation or remediation of controls, procedures,\nand policies at Houghton;\n\u25cf\npossible liabilities for activities of Houghton before the acquisition,\nsuch as possible violations of laws, commercial disputes,\ntax liabilities (as discussed in Note 26 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report),\nand\nother known and unknown liabilities that may not be sufficiently\nprotected against in the Share Purchase Agreement.\nIn addition to the Combination, we have completed several\nother acquisitions over the past several years as discussed\nin Note 2 of\nthe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of this Report.\nAcquired companies may have significant latent\nliabilities that may not be discovered before they are acquired\nand may not be reflected in the price we pay.\nAcquisitions also could\nhave a dilutive effect on our financial results and\nwhile they generally result in goodwill, goodwill could be impaired\nin the future\nresulting in a charge to earnings.\nOur ability to implement our growth strategy may be\nlimited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition\nor joint\nventure\ncandidates, our financial resources, including available\ncash and borrowing capacity,\nand our ability to negotiate and complete suitable\narrangements.\nFurther, the success of our growth\ndepends on our ability to navigate risks similar to those listed above\nand\nsuccessfully integrate acquisitions, including, but not\nlimited to, our ability to:\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully execute the integration or consolidation\nof the acquired or additional business into existing processes and\noperations;\n\u25cf\ndevelop or modify financial reporting, information\nsystems and other related financial tools to ensure overall financial\nintegrity and adequacy of internal control procedures;\n\u25cf\nidentify and take advantage of potential synergies,\nincluding cost reduction opportunities, while retaining\nlegacy business and\nother related attributes;\n\u25cf\nadequately address challenges arising from the increased scope,\ngeographic diversity and complexity of our operations; and\n\u25cf\nfurther penetrate existing, and expand into new,\nmarkets with the product capabilities acquired in acquisitions.\nIf we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our\nexisting business, our financial condition and results of operations\ncould\nbe adversely affected.\nWe may fail\nto obtain the benefits we anticipate from the Combination\nor our other recently completed or\nfuture acquisitions or joint ventures and we may not\ncreate the appropriate infrastructure to support such additional\ngrowth from\norganic or acquired businesses, which could\nalso have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of\noperations.\nGulf and its wholly-owned subsidiary,\nQH Hungary Holdings Limited, have a significant minority stake in the Company\nand the\ncontractual ability to nominate certain directors of the Company,\nwhich may enable them to influence the direction of our business\nand significant corporate decisions.\nAs a result of the Combination, Gulf and its wholly\n-owned subsidiary, QH Hungary\nHoldings Limited (together, the\n\u201cGulf\nAffiliates\u201d), have become our largest shareholders.\nSubject to certain restrictions over timing and amount of sales in the\nshareholders\nagreement they have entered into with the Company,\nif they were to make available for sale a portion of their shares,\nthat portion\ncould represent a significant amount of common\nstock of the Company being sold which could have an adverse impact\non the\nCompany\u2019s stock price.\nIn addition, the Gulf Affiliates currently have\nthe right to designate three individuals for election to our board\nof directors (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d) and this right, together with their share ownership,\ngives them substantial influence over our business, including\nover matters\nsubmitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election\nof directors, amendment of our organizational documents,\nacquisitions\nor other business combinations involving the Company,\nand potentially the ability to prevent extraordinary transactions such\nas a\ntakeover attempt or business combination.\nThe concentration of ownership of our shares held by the Gulf\nAffiliates may make some\nfuture actions more difficult without their support.\nThe Gulf Affiliates, however,\namong other provisions in the shareholders\nagreement, have agreed that for so long as any of their designees\nare on the Board, and for six months thereafter,\nthey will vote all\nQuaker Houghton shares consistent with the recommendations of\nthe Board for each director nominee as reflected in each proxy\nstatement of the Company,\nincluding in support\nof any Quaker Houghton directors nominated for election or\nre-election to the Board\n(except as would conflict with their rights to designees on\nthe Board).\nNevertheless, the interests of Gulf may conflict with our\ninterests or the interests of our other shareholders, though\nwe are not aware of any such existing conflicts of interest at this time.\nFailure to comply with any material provision of our principal\ncredit facility or other debt agreements could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nWe significantly\nincreased our level of indebtedness in connection with\nthe closing of the Combination.\nOur principal credit\nfacility requires the Company to comply with certain\nprovisions and covenants, and, while we do not currently\nconsider these\nprovisions and covenants to be overly restrictive, they\ncould become more difficult to comply with as business or\nfinancial conditions\nchange.\nWe will also be subject\nto interest rate risk due to the variable interest rates within the\ncredit facility and if interest rates rise\nsignificantly, these\ninterest costs would increase as well.\nOur principal credit facility contains provisions that\nare customary for facilities of its type, including affirmative\nand negative\ncovenants, financial covenants and events of default,\nincluding restrictions on (a) the incurrence of additional\nindebtedness, (b)\ninvestments in and acquisitions of other businesses, lines of\nbusiness and divisions, (c) the making of dividends or capital stock\npurchases and (d) dispositions of assets.\nWe may declare\ndividends and make share repurchases in annual amounts not\nexceeding the\ngreater of $50 million annually and 20% of consolidated\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization) if\nwe are otherwise in compliance with the credit facility\nand we may also distribute certain other amounts to our shareholders if\nwe\nsatisfy a consolidated net leverage ratio.\nOther financial covenants contained in our principal credit\nfacility include a consolidated\ninterest coverage test and a consolidated net leverage\ntest.\nCustomary events of default in the credit facility include,\namong others,\ndefaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties,\nnon-performance of covenants, cross-defaults, insolvency,\nand a\nchange of control of the Company in certain circumstances.\nIf we are unable to comply with the financial and\nother provisions of our\nprincipal facility,\nwe could become in default.\nThe occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility\ncould result in all loans\nand other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and\nthe facility being terminated.\nIn addition, deterioration in the\nCompany\u2019s results of\noperations or financial position could significantly increase\nborrowing costs.\nChanges to the LIBOR calculation method or the replacement\nof LIBOR may have adverse consequences for the Company\nthat\ncannot yet reasonably be predicted.\nThe Company\u2019s principal\ncredit facility permits interest on certain borrowings to be calculated based\non LIBOR.\nThe LIBOR\nbenchmark has been subject of national, international,\nand other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and is currently\nexpected to be discontinued after 2021.\nThe transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges,\nincluding with\nrespect to our borrowings and hedging arrangements that\nrely on the LIBOR benchmark.\nFurther, the overall financial market\nmay be\ndisrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of\nLIBOR.\nVarious\nparties are working on industry wide and company specific\ntransition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed\nto LIBOR.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering\ncommittee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions,\nis considering replacing\nLIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d),\na new index calculated using short-term repurchase agreements,\nbacked by Treasury securities.\nAt this time, the future of LIBOR remains uncertain.\nIt is not possible to predict whether SOFR will\nattain market traction as a LIBOR replacement or to\npredict any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted.\nThe potential effect of\nthe phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial position or results of operations cannot yet be predicted,\nbut we\ndo not believe it would have a material adverse impact\non the financial results of the Company.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\nOur global presence subjects us to political and economic\nrisks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity,\nfinancial\nposition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues and earnings are generated\nby non-U.S. operations.\nOur success as a global business will\ndepend, in part, upon our ability to succeed across different\nlegal, regulatory, economic,\nsocial and political conditions by developing,\nimplementing and maintaining policies and strategies that\nare effective in all of the locations where we do\nbusiness.\nRisks inherent in\nour global operations include:\n\u25cf\nincreased transportation and logistics costs, or transportation\nmay be restricted;\n\u25cf\nincreased cost or decreased availability of raw materials;\n\u25cf\ntrade protection measures including import and export\ncontrols, trade embargoes, and trade sanctions between\ncountries or\nregions we serve that could result in our losing access to customers\nand suppliers in those countries or regions;\n\u25cf\nunexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and\ntariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses;\n\u25cf\ntermination or substantial modification of international\ntrade agreements that may adversely affect our access to\nraw\nmaterials and to markets for our products;\n\u25cf\nour agreements with counterparties in countries outside\nthe U.S. may be difficult for us to enforce\nand related receivables\nmay take longer or be difficult for us to collect;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties of staffing and managing\ndispersed international operations;\n\u25cf\nless protective foreign intellectual property laws, and\nmore generally, legal\nsystems that may be less developed and\npredictable than those in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises as well\nas the potential for expropriation or nationalization\nof\nenterprises;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of widespread public health crises, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf\ninstability in or adverse changes to the economic, political\n,\nsocial, legal or regulatory conditions in a country or region where\nwe do business, including hyperinflationary conditions or\nas a result of terrorist activities; and\n\u25cf\ncomplex and dynamic local tax regulations, including\nchanges in foreign laws and tax rates or U.S. laws and tax\nrates with\nrespect to foreign income that may unexpectedly increase\nthe rate at which our income is taxed, impose new and additional\ntaxes on remittances, repatriation or other payments by\nsubsidiaries, or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits.\nThe current global geopolitical and trade environment\ncreates the potential for increased escalation of domestic and international\ntariffs and retaliatory trade policies.\nFurther changes in U.S. trade policy and additional\nretaliatory actions by U.S. trade partners\ncould result in a worsening of economic conditions.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage these and other\nrisks associated with our\ninternational businesses, the risks could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations\nor financial condition.\nAdditionally, on\nJanuary 31, 2020, the United Kingdom\u2019s\n(\u201cU.K.\u201d) ended its membership in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d)\n(commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d).\nThe U.K. and the EU entered into a trade and cooperation agreement\neffective January 1, 2021,\nbut uncertainty remains regarding its implications and\nimplementation,\nand whether any new trade agreements with other countries or\nterritories will be agreed upon and implemented and how any\nsuch agreements may impact our business.\nThe long-term economic,\nlegal, political and social implications of Brexit, including\nregarding data protection in the U.K. and the free movement\nof goods,\nservices, and people between the U.K., the EU, and\nelsewhere, also remains unclear.\nBrexit has caused and could cause further\ndisruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our\nbusiness in the U.K. and EU, including affecting our\nrelationships with our\nexisting and future customers, suppliers and employees.\nBrexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent\nnational laws\nand regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to\nreplace or replicate.\nBrexit could also lead to calls for similar referendums\nin other European jurisdictions which could cause increased\neconomic volatility in the European and global markets.\nUncertainty\naround these and related issues could lead to adverse\neffects on the economy of the U.K. or in the other economies\nin which we\noperate.\nThere can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not\nhave a material adverse effect on our business operations,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nThe scope of our international operations subjects us to risks from\ncurrency fluctuations that could adversely affect\nour liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nOur non-U.S. operations generate significant revenues\nand earnings.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect\nproduct demand and may adversely affect the\nprofitability in U.S. dollars of the products and services we provide\nin international\nmarkets where payment for our products and services is made\nin the local currency.\nOur financial results are affected by currency\nfluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and\nthe euro, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, the Chinese renminbi,\nand the\nIndian rupee, and the impact of those currency fluctuations\non the underlying economies.\nDuring the past three years, sales by our\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries, which use their local currencies as their\nfunctional currency,\naccounted for approximately 60% to 70% of our\nconsolidated net sales.\nWe generally do\nnot use financial instruments that expose us to significant risk\ninvolving foreign currency\ntransaction; however, the relative size\nof our non-U.S. activities has a significant impact on reported\noperating results and our net\nassets.\nTherefore, as exchange rates change, our results can\nbe materially affected.\nIncorporated by reference is the foreign exchange\nrisk information contained in Item 7A of this Report\nand the geographic information in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nAlso, we occasionally source inventory in a different\ncountry than that of the intended sale.\nThis practice can give rise to foreign\nexchange risk.\nWe seek to mitigate this\nrisk through local sourcing of raw materials in the majority\nof our locations.\nRisks Relating to Our Supply Chain\nIf we are unable to obtain price increases or contract concessions sufficient\nto offset increases in the costs of raw materials,\nthis\ncould result in a loss of sales, gross profit, and/or market\nshare and could have a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nConversely, if we fail to adjust prices in a\ndeclining raw material cost environment, we could\nlose sales, gross profit, and/or market share which could have\na material adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and\nresults of operations.\nQuaker Houghton uses approximately 3,000 different\nraw materials, including animal fats, vegetable oils, mineral oils,\noleochemicals, ethylene, solvents, surfactant agents, various\nchemical compounds that act as additives to our base formulations,\nand a\nwide variety of other organic and inorganic\ncompounds, and various derivatives of the foregoing.\nThe price of mineral oils and their\nderivatives can be affected by the price of\ncrude oil and industry refining capacity.\nAnimal fat and vegetable oil prices, as well as the\nprices of other raw materials, are impacted by their\nown specific supply and demand factors, as well as by biodiesel\nconsumption\nwhich is also affected by the price of crude\noil.\nAccordingly, significant\nfluctuations in the price of crude oil in the past have had and\nare expected to continue to have a material impact on the\ncost of our raw materials.\nIn addition, many of the raw materials we use are\ncommodity chemicals, which can experience significant\nprice volatility.\nWe generally\nattempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials to\nour customers, but we may be unable to do so (or\nmay be delayed in doing so).\nIn addition, raising prices we charge to\nour customers in order to offset increases in the\nprices we pay\nfor raw materials could cause us to suffer\na loss of sales volumes.\nAlthough we have been successful in the past in recovering\na\nsubstantial amount of raw material cost increases while retaining\nour customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to\ncontinue to offset higher raw material costs or\nretain customers in the future.\nA significant change in margin or the loss of customers\ndue to pricing actions could result in a material adverse\neffect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position, and results of operations.\nLack of availability of raw materials and issues associated with sourcing\nfrom single suppliers and suppliers in volatile economic\nenvironments could have a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial position, and\nresults of operations.\nThe specialty chemical industry periodically experiences\nsupply shortages for certain raw materials.\nIn addition, we source some\nmaterials from a single supplier or from suppliers in\njurisdictions that have experienced political or economic\ninstability.\nEven if we\nhave multiple suppliers of a particular raw material, there\nare occasionally shortages.\nAny significant disruption in supply could affect\nour ability to obtain raw materials or satisfactory substitutes or\ncould increase the cost of such raw materials or substitutes, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nliquidity, financial position and\nresults of operations.\nIn addition, certain raw materials\nthat we use are subject to various regulatory laws, and\na change in our ability to legally use such raw materials may impact the\nproducts or services we are able to offer which\ncould negatively affect our ability to compete and could\nadversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nLoss of a significant manufacturing facility or disruptions within\nour supply chain or in transportation could have a\nmaterial\nadverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located throughout\nthe world.\nWhile we have some redundant capabilities, if one of our facilities\nis forced to shut down or curtail operations because of damage\nor other factors, including natural disasters, labor difficulties\nor\nwidespread public health crises, such as the ongoing\nCOVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to timely supply\nour customers.\nThis\ncould result in a loss of sales over an extended period\nor permanently.\nWhile the Company seeks to mitigate this risk through business\ncontinuity and contingency planning and other measures,\nthe loss of production in any one region over an extended period of time\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nliquidity, financial position and\nresults of operations.\nIn addition, the coronavirus\npandemic has caused and may in the future cause significant\ntravel disruptions, quarantines and/or closures, which could result\nin\ndisruptions to our manufacturing and production operations\nat our facilities, as well as those of our suppliers and customers.\nAny\nlosses due to these events may not be covered by our existing\ninsurance policies or may be subject to certain deductibles.\nWe could\nbe similarly adversely affected by disruptions\nto our supply chain and transportation network.\nThe Company relies\nheavily on railroads, ships, and over-the-road shipping methods to\ntransport raw materials to its manufacturing facilities and to\ntransport finished products to customers.\nThe costs of transporting our products could be negatively\naffected by factors outside of our\ncontrol, including shipping container shortages or global\nimbalances in shipping capabilities, rail service interruptions or rate\nincreases, extreme weather events, tariffs,\nrising fuel costs and capacity constraints.\nSignificant delays or increased costs affecting our\nsupply chain could materially affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nDisruptions at our suppliers could lead to short\nterm or longer term increases in raw material or energy\ncosts and/or reduced availability of materials or energy,\npotentially affecting\nour financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Domestic and Foreign Taxation\nand Government Regulation and Oversight\nChanges in tax laws could result in fluctuations in our effective\ntax rate and have a material effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial\nposition and results of operation.\nWe pay income\ntaxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions.\nOur effective tax rate is derived from a combination\nof local\ntax rates and tax attributes applicable to our operations in\nthe various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we\noperate.\nOur effective tax rate and respective tax liabilities could\ntherefore be materially affected by changes in\nthe mix of earnings in countries\nwith differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax\nrates, expiration or lapses of tax credits or incentives, changes\nin uncertain tax\npositions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or in how they are\ninterpreted or\nenforced, including matters such as transfer pricing.\nOne example is the impact of the U.S. Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act, enacted in the U.S.\nin 2017 (\u201cU.S. Tax\nReform\u201d).\nWe have made\nvarious interpretations and assumptions with regard to uncertainties\nand ambiguities in\nthe application of certain provisions of U.S. Tax\nReform which could turn out to be incorrect.\nIn addition, we are regularly under\naudit by tax authorities, and the final decisions of\nsuch audits could materially affect our current tax estimates and\ntax positions.\nSee\nNote 10 and Note 26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of certain\nincome and\nnon-income tax audits and inspections.\nAny of these factors or similar tax-related risks could cause our\neffective tax rate and tax-\nrelated payments,\nincluding any such payments related to tax liabilities of businesses we have\nacquired, to significantly differ from\nprevious periods and current or future expectations\nwhich could have a material effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results\nof operations.\nPending and future legal proceedings including environmental\nmatters could have a material adverse effect on\nour liquidity,\nfinancial position, and results of operations, as well as our reputation\nin the markets it serves.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are routinely party\nto proceedings, cases, and requests for information from, and negotiations\nwith, various claimants and federal and state agencies relating\nto various legal matters, including tax and environmental\nmatters.\nSee\nNote 10 and Note 26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Item 8 of this Report, which describes uncertain\ntax positions\nand tax audits and inspections, as well as certain information\nconcerning pending asbestos-related litigation against\nan inactive\nsubsidiary, amounts\naccrued associated with certain environmental, non-capital remediation\ncosts and other potential commitments or\ncontingencies.\nAn adverse result in one or more pending or ongoing matters\nor any potential future matter of a similar nature could\nmaterially and adversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial position, and results of operations, as well as our reputation\nin the markets we\nserve.\nFailure to comply with the complex global regulatory\nenvironment in which we operate could have an adverse impact\non our\nreputation and/or a material adverse effect\non our liquidity, financial position and\nresults of operations.\nWe are subject\nto government regulation in all of the jurisdictions in which\nwe conduct our business.\nChanges in the regulatory\nenvironments\nin which we operate, particularly,\nbut not limited to, the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, China, India, Thailand,\nAustralia, the\nU.K. and the EU, could lead to heightened regulatory compliance\ncosts and scrutiny, could\nadversely impact our ability to continue\nselling certain products in the U.S. or foreign markets,\nand/or could otherwise increase the cost of doing business.\nWhile we seek to\nmitigate these risks through a variety of actions,\nincluding receiving Responsible Care Certification, ongoing\nemployee training,\nand\nemploying a comprehensive environmental, health and\nsafety program, there is no guarantee these actions will prevent all potential\nregulatory compliance issues.\nFor instance, failure to comply with the EU\u2019s\nRegistration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of\nChemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) regulations or other similar laws and\nregulations could result in our inability to sell certain\nproducts or we\ncould incur fines, ongoing monitoring obligations or other\nfuture business consequences, which could have a material adverse\neffect\non our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, the U.S. Toxic\nSubstances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d) requires\nchemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard\nand that unreasonable risks identified during risk\nevaluation be\neliminated.\nThis regulation and other pending initiatives at the U.S. state\nlevel, as well as initiatives in Canada, Asia and other\nregions, could potentially require toxicological testing\nand risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals\nused\nor produced by us.\nThese assessments may result in heightened concerns about\nthe chemicals involved and additional requirements\nbeing placed on their production, handling, labeling\nor use.\nThese concerns and additional requirements could also\nincrease the cost\nincurred by our customers to use our chemical products\nand otherwise limit their use which could lead to a\ndecrease in demand for\nthese products.\nA decrease in demand due to these issues could have an adverse\nimpact on our business and results of operation.\nFurther, we are subject to the\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d),\nthe U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery,\nanti-\ncorruption and anti-money laundering laws in jurisdictions around\nthe world.\nThe FCPA, the\nU.K. Bribery Act and similar laws\ngenerally prohibit companies and their officers,\ndirectors, employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners\nand agents,\nfrom making improper payments or providing other improper\nitems of value to government officials or other\npersons.\nWhile we have\npolicies and procedures and internal controls designed\nto address compliance with such laws, we cannot guarantee that\nour employees\nand third-party intermediaries, business partners and\nagents will not take, or be alleged to have taken, actions in violation of\nsuch\npolicies and laws for which we may be ultimately held\nresponsible.\nDetecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations\ncan be extensive and require a significant diversion of\ntime, resources and attention from senior management.\nAny violation of the\nFCPA, the U.K.\nBribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery,\nanti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could\nresult in\nwhistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage,\ninvestigations, loss of export privileges, and criminal or\ncivil sanctions, penalties\nand fines, any of which could adversely affect\nour business and financial condition.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology\nacross international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and\nregulations.\nOur import activities are governed by the unique customs\nlaws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate.\nMoreover,\nmany countries, including the U.S., control the export and\nre-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related\nexport record-keeping and reporting obligations.\nGovernments may also impose economic sanctions against certain\ncountries, persons\nand entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions\ninvolving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit\nor prevent our\nconduct of business in certain jurisdictions.\nThe laws and regulations concerning import activity,\nexport record-keeping and reporting, export control and\neconomic sanctions\nare complex and constantly changing.\nThese laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and\nunscheduled operational\ndowntime.\nMoreover, any failure to comply with applicable\nlegal and regulatory trading obligations could result in\ncriminal and civil\npenalties and sanctions such as fines, imprisonment,\ndebarment from governmental\ncontracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import\nand export privileges.\nIn addition, investigations by governmental authorities as well\nas legal, social, economic and political issues in\nthese countries could have a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject\nto the risks that our employees, joint venture partners\nand agents outside of the U.S. may fail to comply with\nother applicable laws.\nUncertainty related to environmental regulation and industry standards\nrelating to, as well as physical risks of, climate change and\nbiodiversity loss, could impact our results of operations and\nfinancial position.\nIncreased public and stakeholder awareness and concern\nregarding global climate change, biodiversity\nloss, and other\nenvironmental risks may result in more extensive international,\nregional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce\nor\nmitigate the effects of these changes.\nThese regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards\nor industry standards than the\nvoluntary goals that we have established or require changes\nto be adopted on a more accelerated time frame.\nThere continues to be a\nlack of consistent climate legislation, which\ncreates economic and regulatory uncertainty.\nFor example, the new U.S. presidential\nadministration has issued Executive Orders seeking to\nadopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and\nto suspend,\nrevise, or rescind prior agency actions that are identified\nas conflicting with the administration\u2019s\nclimate policies.\nThe new\npresidential administration also announced that in February\n2021, the U.S. will formally re-join the Paris Agreement.\nThe Paris\nAgreement requires countries to review and \u201crepresent\na progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions\nwhich set\ngreenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five\nyears.\nThough we are closely following developments in this area\nand changes in\nthe regulatory landscape in the U.S., we cannot predict\nhow or when those challenges may ultimately impact our business.\nWhile\ncertain climate change initiatives may result in new\nbusiness opportunities for us in the area of alternative\nfuel technologies and\nemissions control, compliance with these initiatives may also result\nin additional costs to us including, among other things, increased\nproduction costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances\nor additional restrictions on production or operations.\nIn addition, the potential physical impacts of climate change\nand biodiversity loss are highly uncertain and\nwill be particular to the\ncircumstances developing in various geographical regions.\nThese may include extreme weather events and long-term\nchanges in\ntemperature levels and water availability as well as damaged ecosystems.\nThe physical risks of climate change and biodiversity loss\nmay impact our facilities, our customers and suppliers, and\nthe availability and costs of materials and natural resources, sources\nand\nsupply of energy,\nproduct demand and manufacturing.\nIn particular, climate change serves as a risk multiplier\nincreasing both the\nfrequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect\nour business operations.\nIf environmental laws or regulations or industry standards\nare either changed or adopted and impose significant operational\nrestrictions and compliance requirements upon us or\nour products, or our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of\nclimate\nchange or biodiversity loss, our business, capital expenditures,\nresults of operations, financial condition and competitive\nposition could\nbe negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to\nstringent labor and employment laws in many jurisdictions in which\nwe operate, and our relationship with our\nemployees could deteriorate which could adversely impact\nour operations.\nA majority of our full-time employees are employed outside\nthe U.S.\nIn many jurisdictions where we operate, labor and\nemployment laws grant significant job protection to certain\nemployees including rights on termination of employment.\nIn addition, in\ncertain countries our employees are represented by\nworks councils or are governed by collective bargaining\nagreements.\nWe are often\nrequired to consult with and seek the consent or advice of\nworks councils or labor unions.\nThese regulations and laws, together with\nour obligations to seek consent or consult with the relevant\nunions or works councils, could have a significant impact\non our flexibility\nin managing costs and responding to market changes.\nWhile the Company believes it has generally positive relations with its labor\nunions and employees, there is no guarantee the Company\nwill be able to successfully negotiate new or renew labor\nagreements\nwithout work stoppages, labor difficulties or\nunfavorable terms.\nIf we were to experience any extended interruption of operations\nat\nany of our facilities because of strikes or other work stoppages,\nour results of operations and financial condition could be\nmaterially\nand adversely affected.\nWe may be\nunable to adequately protect our proprietary rights and trade brands,\nwhich may limit our ability to compete in our\nmarkets and could adversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nWe have a\nlimited number of patents and patent applications, including\npatents issued, applied for, or acquired\nin the U.S. and in\nvarious foreign countries, some of which are material\nto our business.\nHowever, we rely principally on our\nproprietary formulae and\nthe applications know-how and experience to meet\ncustomer needs.\nAlso, our products are identified by trademarks that are registered\nthroughout our marketing area.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary information\nthrough patent and trademark filings, and\nthe use of appropriate trade secret protections, it is possible\nthat competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy,\nuse,\ndisclose or replicate our formulae, products, and proces\nses.\nSimilarly, third\nparties may assert claims against us and our customers\nand distributors alleging our products infringe upon\nthird-party intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, the laws and/or judicial\nsystems of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture,\nmarket and sell our products may afford little or\nno effective protection\nof our proprietary technology or trade brands.\nAlso, security over our global information technology structure\nis subject to increasing\nrisks associated with cyber-crime and other related cyber-security\nthreats.\nThese potential risks to our proprietary information, trade\nbrands and other intellectual property could subject us to\nincreased competition and a failure to protect, defend or enforce our\nintellectual property rights could negatively impact\nour liquidity, financial position\nand results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business could be adversely affected\nby environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or by\npotential product, service\nor other related liability claims.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of specialty\nchemical products and other related services involve inherent\nexposure to\npotential product liability claims, service level claims, product\nrecalls and related adverse publicity.\nSome customers have and may in\nthe future require us to represent that our products conform\nto certain product specifications provided by them.\nAny failure to comply\nwith such specifications could result in claims or legal\naction against us.\nAny of the foregoing potential product or service risks could\nalso result in substantial and unexpected expenditures\nand affect customer confidence in our products and\nservices, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our liquidity,\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, our business is subject to hazards associated\nwith the manufacturing, handling, use, storage, and transportation\nof\nchemical materials and products, including historical operations\nat our current and former facilities.\nThese potential hazards could\ncause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage\nto, or destruction of, property or equipment and environmental contamination\nor\nother environmental damage, which could have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results\nof operations.\nIn the\njurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous U.S.\nand non-U.S. national, federal, state and local environmental,\nhealth and safety laws and regulations, including those\ngoverning the discharge of pollutants into the air and\nwater, the management\nand disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the\ncleanup of contaminated properties.\nWe currently\nuse, and in the past have\nused, hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and\nwe have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject\nto claims relating\nto exposure to hazardous materials.\nWe also have\ngenerated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number\nof our facilities.\nLiabilities associated with the investigation and\ncleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury,\nproperty damages or\nnatural resource damages arising from the release of,\nor exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations\nwithout regard to violations of laws or regulations\nor other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so\nthat a responsible\nparty\nmay be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved,\nor even the entire loss).\nThese liabilities may also be imposed\non many different entities, including, for\nexample, current and prior property owners or operators, as well as entities\nthat arranged for\nthe disposal of the hazardous substances.\nThe liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify\nor quantify.\nIn addition, the\noccurrence of disruptions, shutdowns or other material\noperating problems at our facilities or those of our customers\ndue to any of\nthese risks could adversely affect our reputation\nand have a material adverse effect on our operations\nas a whole, including our results\nof operations and cash flows, both during and after the\nperiod of operational difficulties.\nFurther, some of the raw materials we handle\nare subject to government regulation.\nThese regulations affect the manufacturing\nprocesses, handling, uses and applications of our products.\nIn addition, our production facilities and a number of our distribution\ncenters require numerous operating permits.\nDue to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations,\nour operations\nmay exceed limits under permits or we may not have\nthe proper permits to conduct our operations.\nOngoing compliance with environmental laws, regulations\nand permits that impact registration/approval requirements,\ntransportation and storage of raw materials and finished\nproducts, and storage and disposal of wastes could require\nus to make changes\nin manufacturing processes or product formulations and\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations.\nWe may\nincur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal\nor civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience\ninterruptions in our\noperations, including as a result of revocation, non-renewal\nor modification of the Company\u2019s\noperating permits and revocation of the\nCompany\u2019s product\nregistrations, for violations arising under these laws or permit\nrequirements.\nAny such revocation, modification or\nnon-renewal may require the Company to cease or limit\nthe manufacture and sale of its products at one or more of its facilities, which\nmay limit or prevent the Company\u2019s\nability to meet product demand or build new facilities and\nmay have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company\u2019s business, financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional information may arise in the future\nconcerning the nature or extent of our liability with\nrespect to identified sites, and additional sites may be identified\nfor which we are\nalleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase\nour environmental accrual or the upper range of the\ncosts we believe we\ncould reasonably incur for such matters.\nIncreased compliance costs may not affect competitors\nin the same way that they affect us\ndue to differences in product formulations,\nmanufacturing locations or other factors, and we could be at a competitive\ndisadvantage,\nwhich might adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe could be\nsubject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to\nproperties or businesses we have divested.\nIn connection with the sale of certain properties and\nbusinesses, we agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such\nproperties for\ncertain types of matters, such as certain breaches of representations\nand warranties, taxes and certain environmental matters.\nWith\nrespect to environmental matters, the discovery of\ncontamination arising from properties that we have divested may\nexpose us to\nindemnity obligations under the sale agreements with\nthe buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and\nother damages\nunder\napplicable environmental laws, even if we were not\naware of the contamination.\nWe may not have\ninsurance coverage for such\nindemnity obligations.\nFurther, we cannot predict the nature of\nand the amount\nof any indemnity or other obligations we may have to\nthe applicable purchaser.\nThese payments may be costly and may adversely affect\nour financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain\nproduct, property,\nbusiness interruption, casualty,\nand other general liability insurance, but this may not cover\nall\nrisks associated with the hazards of our business and these\ncoverages are subject to limitations, including deductibles\nand coverage\nlimits.\nWe may incur\nlosses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance\npolicies, including liabilities for\nenvironmental remediation.\nIn addition, from time to time, various types of insurance\nfor companies in the specialty chemical\nindustry have not been available on commercially acceptable\nterms and, in some cases, have not been available at all.\nWe are\npotentially at additional risk if one or more of our\ninsurance carriers fail.\nAdditionally, severe disruptions\nin the domestic and global\nfinancial\nmarkets could adversely impact the ratings and survival\nof some of our insurers.\nFuture downgrades in the ratings of enough\ninsurers could adversely impact both the availability of\nappropriate insurance coverage and its cost.\nIn the future, we may not be able\nto obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our\npremiums may increase significantly on coverage that\nwe maintain.\nImpairment evaluations of goodwill, intangible assets, investments or other\nlong-lived assets could result in a reduction in our\nrecorded asset values which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial position and results of\noperation.\nWe perform\nreviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on\nan annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events\nindicate a possible impairment.\nWe test goodwill\nat the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of\nthe net assets of the\nreporting unit, including goodwill, to the reporting unit's fair\nvalue.\nSimilarly, we test indefinite\n-lived intangible assets by comparing\nthe fair value of the assets to their carrying values.\nIf the carrying values of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible\nassets exceed their\nfair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets would\nbe considered impaired.\nIn addition, we perform a review of a\ndefinite-lived intangible asset or other long-lived\nasset when changes in circumstances or events indicate a possible\nimpairment.\nIf\nany impairment or related charge is warranted,\nthen our financial position and results of operations could be\nmaterially affected. See\nNote 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Item 8 of this Report.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches\nin the security of our systems could adversely affect\nour business\nand our customer relationships, and subject us to fines or other\nregulatory actions.\nWe rely on\ninformation technology systems to obtain, process, analyze, manage,\ntransmit, and store electronic information in our\nday-to-day operations.\nWe also rely\non our technology infrastructure in all aspects of our business, including\nto interact with\ncustomers and suppliers, fulfill orders and bill, collect\nand make payments, ship products, provide support to customers,\nand fulfill\ncontractual obligations.\nOur information technology systems are subject to potential\ndisruptions, including significant network or\npower outages, cyberattacks, computer viruses, other malicious codes,\nand/or unauthorized access attempts, any of which, if\nsuccessful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise\nour confidential or proprietary information and disrupt\nour operations.\nSecurity breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure\nof confidential information or personal data belonging to\nour employees,\npartners, customers or suppliers for which we may\nincur liability.\nCybersecurity incidents, such as these, are becoming\nmore\nsophisticated and frequent, and there can be no assurance\nthat our protective measures will prevent security breaches that could\nhave a\nsignificant impact on our business, reputation and financial\nresults.\nWe are subject\nto the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted\nby federal, state and foreign legislatures and\ngovernmental agencies in various countries in which we\noperate, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation.\nImplementing\nand complying with these laws and regulations may\nbe more costly or take longer than we anticipate, or could\notherwise affect our\nbusiness operations.\nBreaches, cyber incidents and disruptions, or failure to\ncomply with laws and regulations related to information security or\nprivacy could result in legal claims or proceedings against us\nby governmental entities or individuals, significant\nfines, penalties or\njudgements, disruption of our operations, remediation\nrequirements, changes to our business practices, and damage\nto our reputation.\nTherefore, a failure to monitor, mainta\nin or protect our information technology systems and data\nintegrity effectively or to anticipate,\nplan for and recover from significant disruptions to\nthese systems could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of\noperations or financial condition.\nOur business depends on attracting and retaining qualified\nmanagement and other key personnel.\nDue to the specialized and technical nature of our business, our\nfuture performance is dependent on our ability to attract, develop\nand retain qualified management, commercial, technical,\nand other key personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense,\nand we\nmay be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel.\nIn an effort to mitigate such risks, the Company\nutilizes retention\nbonuses, offers competitive pay and maintains continuous\nsuccession planning, including for our senior executive officers.\nHowever,\nthere can be no assurance that these mitigating factors\nwill be adequate to attract or retain qualified management or other key\npersonnel.\nFailure to retain key employees could also adversely affect\nour ability to complete the integration of the Combination.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from\nstakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance\n(\u201cESG\u201d) practices may impose additional costs on us or expose\nus to new or additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing\nscrutiny from stakeholders related to their ESG practices.\nInvestor\nadvocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment\nfunds, and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on\nESG\npractices and in recent years have placed increasing\nimportance on the implications and social cost of their investments.\nRegardless of\nthe industry, investors\u2019\nincreased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters\nmay impact access to capital, as investors may\ndecide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a\nresult of their assessment of a company\u2019s\nESG practices.\nWe face pressures\nfrom certain stakeholders to prioritize and promote\nsustainable practices and reduce our carbon footprint. Our\nstakeholders may pressure us to implement ESG procedures\nor standards beyond those we have in place in order\nto continue engaging\nwith us, to remain invested in us, or before they will make\nfurther investments in us.\nAdditionally, we may\nface reputational\nchallenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do\nnot meet the standards set by certain constituencies.\nWe have adopted\ncertain practices as highlighted in the Company\u2019s\nSustainability Report, including with respect to environmental stewardship.\nFurther, as we work to align\nwith the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s\nTask Force on\nClimate-related Financial\nDisclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards\nBoard, we continue to expand our disclosures in these areas.\nThis is\nconsistent with our commitment to executing on a\nstrategy that reflects the economic, social, and environmental\nimpact we have on\nthe world while advancing and complementing our\nbusiness strategy.\nOur disclosures on these matters and standards we set for\nourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may\ninfluence our reputation and the value of our brand.\nIt is possible that our\nstakeholders might not be satisfied with our ESG efforts\nor the speed of their adoption.\nIf we do not meet our stakeholders\u2019\nexpectations, our business and/or our ability to access\ncapital could be harmed.\nAny harm to our reputation resulting from setting\nthese standards or our failure or perceived failure to meet\nsuch standards could adversely affect our business, financial\nperformance,\nand growth.\nAdditionally, adverse\neffects upon our customers\u2019 industries related to\nthe worldwide social and political environment, including\nuncertainty or instability resulting from climate change\nor biodiversity loss, changes in political leadership and environmental\npolicies,\nchanges in geopolitical-social views toward fossil fuels and\nrenewable energy,\nconcern about the environmental impact of climate\nchange or biodiversity loss, and investors\u2019 expectation\ns\nregarding ESG matters, may also adversely affect\ndemand for our services.\nAny long-term material adverse effect on\nour customers or their industries could have a significant financial\nand operational adverse\nimpact on our business.\nTerrorist\nattacks, other acts of violence or war,\nnatural disasters, widespread public health crises or other uncommon\nglobal events\nmay affect the markets in which we operate and\nour profitability which could adversely affect our liquidity,\nfinancial position and\nresults of operations.\nTerrorist attacks,\nother acts of violence or war, natural\ndisasters, widespread public health crises, including the\nongoing COVID-\n19 pandemic, or other uncommon global events may negatively\naffect our operations.\nThere can be no assurance that there will not be\nterrorist attacks against the U.S. or other locations where we\ndo business.\nAlso, other uncommon global events such as earthquakes,\nhurricanes, fires and tsunamis cannot be predicted.\nTerrorist attacks,\nother acts of violence or armed conflicts, and natural disasters, which\nmay be amplified by ongoing global\nclimate change and biodiversity loss, may directly\nimpact our physical facilities and/or those of our suppliers or customers.\nIn\naddition, terrorist attacks or natural disasters may disrupt\nthe global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result\nthat we may\nnot be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and\nlevels, if at all, for all of our facilities.\nIn addition, available insurance coverage\nmay not be sufficient to cover all of the damage\nincurred or, if available, may be prohibitively\nexpensive.\nWidespread public health\ncrises could also disrupt operations of the Company,\nits suppliers and customers which could have a material adverse\nimpact on our\nresults of operations.\nFor example, refer to \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact\non business and economic conditions have negatively affected\nour\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condi\ntion and the extent and duration of those effects is uncertain,\u201d\nincluded in this \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d section.\nThe consequences of terrorist attacks, other acts of violence\nor armed conflicts, natural disasters, widespread public\nhealth crises or other uncommon global events can\nbe unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee or\neffectively plan for these\nevents, resulting in a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on business and economic\nconditions have negatively affected our business, results\nof\noperations and financial condition and the extent and\nduration of those effects is uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that began in the first quarter\nof 2020 and the resulting impacts significantly disrupted the global\neconomy and financial markets and adversely affected\nthe Company\u2019s operations as well as those\nof its suppliers and customers.\nThe\npandemic and its impacts adversely affected\nthe Company\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition in 2020 and the adverse\neffects have continued into 2021.\nThe Company initially experienced disruptions as a result of COVID-19\nat its China subsidiaries\nand subsequently throughout the rest of the business due\nto the global economic slowdown that ensued and continues.\nWe have\nexperienced, and may experience in the future, temporary\nsite or facility closures at our own facilities or those of our\ncustomers in\nresponse to illness or government mandates in some of\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate.\nEven in facilities that are not closed, we\ncould be affected by reductions in employee\navailability and productivity,\nchanges in operating procedures, and increased costs.\nThe\nCompany anticipates that its future results of operations may\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 until\neffective vaccines\nhave been widely administered.\nIn particular, the spread of COVID-19\nand efforts to contain the virus have:\n\u25cf\nreduced the demand for our products and services as many\ncustomers have reduced production levels;\n\u25cf\ndriven declines in volume and net sales across all reportable\nsegments;\n\u25cf\nrequired us to adjust certain of our facility operating procedures\nand to take steps to reduce costs and preserve liquidity;\nand\n\u25cf\nnegatively affected the estimated fair value of\ncertain of the Company\u2019s reporting\nunits or other indefinite-lived or long-lived\nassets, namely the Company\u2019s\nHoughton and Fluidcare trademarks and tradename indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, such that\ntheir estimated fair values were less than their carrying\nvalues and required adjustments.\nThese effects are likely to increase or become\nexacerbated the longer the crisis continues,\nand the pandemic in the future could\n(or, in some instances, could further):\n\u25cf\nlimit the availability and reduce the productivity of our\nemployees;\n\u25cf\nchallenge our financial reporting systems and processes, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and\nprocedures, including our ability to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules\nand forms,\nand that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our chief executive officer\nand chief financial\nofficer, to allow for timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure;\n\u25cf\npresent challenges as a result of travel restrictions and remote work\narrangements, including, as further described in Item 9A\nof this Report, impacting the planning, execution and timing\nof the Company\u2019s remediation\nand integration plan activities,\nincluding the implementation of new or enhanced business process\nand information technology general controls, as\nnecessary,\nas well as impacting the timing of the Company\u2019s\non-going enterprise resource planning system implementations\n;\n\u25cf\nincrease our costs as a result of emergency\nmeasures that we may take or that may be imposed on us by regulatory\nauthorities;\n\u25cf\ncause a delay in customer payments or cause a deterioration\nof the credit quality of other counterparties that could\nresult in\ncredit losses or force both customer and supplier bankruptcies;\n\u25cf\ncause delays and disruptions in the availability of and timely\ndelivery of materials and components used in our operations;\n\u25cf\ncause us to breach covenants in our existing credit\nfacility, including\ncovenants regarding our consolidated interest coverage\nratio and consolidated net leverage ratio, or increase our\ncost of capital or make additional capital, including the refinancing\nof our existing credit facility,\nmore difficult or available only on terms less favorable\nto us;\n\u25cf\nimpact our liquidity position and cost of and ability to access funds\nfrom financial institutions and capital markets;\n\u25cf\nnegatively affect the estimated fair values of the\nCompany\u2019s reporting units or other\nindefinite-lived or long-lived assets; and\n\u25cf\ncause other risks to impact us, including the other risks described\nin this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nAlthough we have implemented business continuity\nand emergency response plans as well as health and\nsafety measures to\npermit us to continue to provide services and products to customers\nand support our operations, there can be no assurance that the\ncontinued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to\ncontain the virus (including, but not limited to, voluntary and\nmandatory quarantines,\nrestrictions on travel, limiting gatherings of people, reduced\noperations and extended closures of\nmany businesses and institutions)\nwill not further impact our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nHowever, given the unprecedented\nand continually\nevolving developments with respect to this pandemic,\nthe Company cannot, as of the date of this Report, reasonably\nestimate the full\nextent of the impact to its future results of operations or\nto the ability of it or its customers to resume more normal operations.\nA\nfurther prolonged outbreak or resurgence\nand period of continued restrictions on day-to-day life and business operations\nwould likely\nresult in volume declines and lower net sales into 2021\nperiods as well.\nThe ultimate significance of COVID-19 impacts on our\nbusiness will depend on, among other things, the extent and\nduration of\nthe pandemic, the severity of the disease and the number\nof people infected with the virus, the development and continued uncertainty\nregarding availability,\nadministration and long-term efficacy of a vaccine or\nother treatments, including on new strains or mutations of\nthe virus, the longer-term effects on the\neconomy, including market\nvolatility, and the\nmeasures taken by governmental authorities and\nother third parties restricting day-to-day life and the\nlength of time that such measures remain in place, as well as laws and\nother\ngovernmental programs implemented to address the pandemic or\nassist impacted businesses, such as fiscal stimulus and other\nlegislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief.\nEpidemic diseases could negatively affect various\naspects of our business, make it more difficult to\nmeet our obligations to our\ncustomers, and could result in reduced demand from\nour customers.\nThese could have a material adverse effect\non our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected\nby the effects of a widespread outbreak of\ncontagious disease, similar to the COVID-19\nimpacts described above.\nA significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population\ncould result in a widespread health\ncrisis that could adversely affect the economies and\nfinancial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic\ndownturn that could\naffect demand for our products and likely\nimpact our operating results.\nTo the extent that\nthe Company\u2019s customers and\nsuppliers are\nmaterially and adversely impacted by a widespread\noutbreak of contagious disease, this could reduce the availability,\nor result in\ndelays, of materials or supplies to or from the Company,\nwhich in turn could materially interrupt the Company\u2019s\nbusiness operations.\nWe have identified\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting\nthat could, if not remediated, result in\nmaterial misstatements in our financial statements and in the\ninability of our independent registered public accounting\nfirm to\nprovide an unqualified audit opinion which could have a material\nadverse effect on us.\nAs a public company,\nwe are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules\nimplementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require\nmanagement to certify financial and other information in our quarterly\nand\nannual reports and provide an annual management report on\nthe effectiveness of controls over financial reporting.\nAs disclosed under \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d\nof this Report, during the course of preparing our audited financial\nstatements for the Company\u2019s\nannual report on Form 10-K (the \u201c2019 Form 10-K\u201d), we,\nin conjunction with our independent\nregistered public accounting firm, identified certain\nmaterial weaknesses as of December 31, 2019.\nA material weakness is a\ndeficiency, or combination\nof deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely\nbasis.\nWe identified\ncertain deficiencies in our application of the principles associated\nwith the criteria set forth by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\nthat management\nconcluded constituted a material weakness.\nWe did not\ndesign and maintain effective controls in response\nto the risks of material\nmisstatement.\nSpecifically, changes\nto existing controls or the implementation of new controls\nwere not sufficient to respond to\nchanges to the risks of material misstatement in financial\nreporting as a result of becoming a larger,\nmore complex global organization\ndue to the Combination.\nThis material weakness also contributed to an additional material\nweakness as we did not design and\nmaintain effective controls over the review\nof pricing, quantity and customer data to verify that revenue\nrecognized was complete and\naccurate.\nDuring 2020, management began developing its full remediation\nplan and executing\nwhat will be a multi-step remediation process\nto completely and fully remediate its identified material weaknesses\nas further described in Item 9A of this Report. However,\nthe\nCompany has not yet remediated the previously identified\nmaterial weakness over\nthe review of pricing, quantity and customer data to\nverify that revenue recognized was complete and\naccurate as of December 31, 2020, and as a result, the Company\nalso did not\nremediate the previously identified material weakness related\nto risk assessment.\nUntil the remediation plans are deemed effective,\nwe\ncannot assure you that our actions will adequately remediate\nthese material weaknesses or that additional material weaknesses in\nour\ninternal controls will not be identified in the future.\nAlthough the Company expects to be able to remedy these material\nweaknesses\nduring 2021, it may be unable to do so due to the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, in which case we\nwould\ncontinue to be subject to the risk that a material misstatement\nof annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented\nor\ndetected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to identify and correct material weaknesses in a\ntimely manner could have a material adverse\neffect on the financial condition of the Company.\nAs a result of these material weaknesses, management\ndetermined that both our disclosure controls and procedures and\ninternal\ncontrol over financial reporting were not effective\nas of December 31, 2020 and our independent registered public\naccounting firm\nlikewise issued an opinion indicating that we had not maintained\neffective internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31,\n2020.\nBecause these control deficiencies could have resulted\nin misstatements of interim or annual consolidated financial statements\nand\ndisclosures that could have resulted in a material misstatement\nthat would not be prevented or detected, we performed additional\nanalysis and procedures to ensure that our consolidated\nfinancial statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were\nprepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly reflected\nour financial position and results of operations as of and\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.\nSubsequently, notwithstanding\nthese material weaknesses, the Company has concluded that\nthese control\ndeficiencies did not result in a misstatement to the related\nbalances and disclosures for the year ended December\n31, 2020.\nOur management,\nincluding our chief executive officer and chief financial\nofficer, does not expect that\nour internal control over\nfinancial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated,\ncan provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control\nsystem\u2019s objectives will be met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must\nreflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of controls must be considered relative\nto their costs.\nControls can\nbe circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,\nby collusion of two or more people, or by management override\nof the\ncontrols.\nOver time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\ncircumstances or deterioration in the degree of\ncompliance with policies or procedures may occur.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective\ncontrol system,\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may\nnot be detected.", "PERMNO": 64929, "SIC": 2990, "TIC": "KWR"}
