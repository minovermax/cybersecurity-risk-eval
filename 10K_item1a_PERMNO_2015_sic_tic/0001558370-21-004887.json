Risk Factors\nFactors Affecting our Future Prospects\nSet forth below is a description of certain risk factors which we believe may be relevant to an understanding of us and our business. Security holders are cautioned that these and other factors may affect future performance and cause actual results to differ from those which may be anticipated. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 could further exacerbate many of the risk described below or described elsewhere herein. See the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nSummary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks we face:\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\n\u25cf Widespread health developments, including the global COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf We are highly leveraged. Our substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary.\n\u25cf Borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are based upon variable rates of interest, which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates or changes affecting the availability of LIBOR occur.\n\u25cf The covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nRisks Related to our Operations\n\u25cf We need to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition, but our operations will not improve if we cannot effectively implement our business strategy or if our strategy is negatively affected by worsening economic conditions.\n\u25cf We purchase all of our brand and generic drugs from a single wholesaler. A disruption in this relationship may have a negative effect on us.\n\u25cf Recent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\u25cf Our ability to attract and motivate talented employees is uncertain and poses financial risks.\n\u25cf Failure or significant disruption to our information technology systems/infrastructure or a cyber-security breach could adversely affect our operations.\n\u25cf We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\n\u25cf Any failure to protect the security of personal information about our customers and associates, could result in significant business liability and reputational harm.\n\u25cf Any inability to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places may have a negative impact on our operations.\n\u25cf A variety of business continuity hazards and risks could materially and adversely affect our and our vendors\u2019 business operations and our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.\nRisks Related to the Retail Pharmacy and PBM Industries in which we Operate\n\u25cf The markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us.\n\u25cf A change in our pharmacy and payor mix could adversely affect our profit margins.\n\u25cf Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf There are risks related to the availability, pricing, and safety profiles of the pharmacy drugs and products we purchase and sell.\n\u25cf Changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs and changes in industry pricing benchmarks could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf A substantial portion of our pharmacy revenue is currently generated from a limited number of third party payors, and, if there is a loss of, or significant change to prescription drug reimbursement rates by, a major third party payor, our revenue will decrease and our business and prospects could be adversely impacted.\n\u25cf A substantial portion of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue is currently generated from a limited number of customers, and, if there is a loss of a major customer, our revenue will decrease and our business and prospects could be adversely impacted.\n\u25cf We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.\n\u25cf We are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements; our noncompliance or a significant legislative, regulatory, or public policy change could adversely affect our business, the results of our operations or our financial condition.\n\u25cf Government audits, investigations, and reviews could lead to liability and operational changes.\n\u25cf If our compliance or other systems and processes fail or are deemed inadequate, we may become subject to regulatory actions and/or litigation.\n\u25cf Certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services; our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us.\n\u25cf We may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause injury, illness or death.\n\u25cf Risks of declining gross margins in the PBM industry could adversely impact our profitability.\n\u25cf The possibility of PBM client loss and/or the failure to win new PBM business could impact our ability to secure new business.\n\u25cf Regulatory or business changes relating to our participation in Medicare Part D, the medical loss ratio for our Medicare Part D eligible members, or our failure to otherwise execute on our strategies related to Medicare Part D, may adversely impact our business and our financial results.\n\u25cf Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers, or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services.\n\u25cf The impact of extreme events, natural disasters, and climate change could create unpredictability for our business operations.\n\u25cf The seasonal nature of our business causes fluctuations in operations.\n\u25cf Changes in laws governing labor, employers, and union organizing may increase our labor costs.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWidespread health developments, including the global COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to closely monitor the events and impacts relating to COVID-19, which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and has spread to, and impacted the economies of, every state in the U.S. and countries around the world. This pandemic, as well as the reality or fear of any other adverse public health developments, has impacted and could further adversely and materially affect, among other things, our workforce, operations, stores, consumer behavior, and supply chain, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and business partners. The local, national and international responses to the virus have continued to evolve and have included voluntary and in some cases, mandatory quarantines as well as shut downs and other restrictions on travel and commercial, social, medical and other activities, and declarations of emergencies. Such measures have contributed to increases in the unemployment rate and changes in customer spending.\nThe nature and scope of COVID-19\u2019s impacts to our business and operations will depend on a series of evolving factors and developments that are difficult to assess, predict, or control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, and future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas where we operate;\n\u25cf the duration, degree, and effectiveness of governmental, business, or other measures implemented in response to the pandemic, including but not limited to quarantine, shelter-in-place, social distancing and face mask measures; restrictions on or changes to our operations up to and including complete or partial closure of our stores, facilities and distribution centers; economic measures; access to unemployment compensation; stimulus payments and other fiscal policy changes; or additional measures that may not yet be effected;\n\u25cf the timing, availability and supply chain of, and prevalence of access to and utilization of, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19;\n\u25cf changes in the timing and extent of restrictions impacting our business and our customers as a result of COVID-19, which may vary materially over time and among the different regions and markets we serve;\n\u25cf the extent and duration of the effect on consumer confidence, economic well-being, spending, and drug utilization, deferred medical care, the rate of elective procedures and even recommended screening tests, as well as customer demand, consumer behavior, buying patterns and shopping behaviors, including spend on discretionary categories, which often include higher margin products, and increased utilization of online sales channels, both during and after the pandemic;\n\u25cf the health of our associates, costs to field our team, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, corporate offices and other critical functions, including if associates are quarantined as a result of exposure;\n\u25cf the impacts on our distribution channels and supply chain, including manufacturers and suppliers of products we sell, including the supply chain of COVID-19 vaccines and other pharmaceuticals, and logistics and transportation providers, and on our other strategic partners and service providers, including the ability of these third parties to pay amounts owed to us timely or in full or to remain in business;\n\u25cf consequences on our business performance and strategic initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response;\n\u25cf high MLR on our Part D business due to stockpiling maintenance medications;\n\u25cf continued delays in new request for proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d) from new or existing PBM customers or RFP decisions during our PBM selling season;\n\u25cf volatility or disruptions in the credit and financial markets during and/or after the pandemic;\n\u25cf any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions;\n\u25cf the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to our associates and business partners, among others;\n\u25cf changes to, and modifications of, business practices and internal policies and procedures, including in response to regulatory changes as a result of COVID-19;\n\u25cf increased cyber security risks, including as a result of our associates, and employees of our business partners, vendors, suppliers and other third parties with which we do business, working remotely;\n\u25cf the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers compensation and potential increases in insurance costs, medical claims costs and workers\u2019 compensation claim costs;\n\u25cf the impact of litigation or claims from customers, employees, suppliers, regulators or other third parties relating to COVID-19 or our actions in response thereto;\n\u25cf the potential reputational harm to our brands if we fail to appropriately respond, or are perceived to have inadequately responded, to risks relating to COVID-19;\n\u25cf additional increased costs associated with operating during the global pandemic;\n\u25cf evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary and inflationary pressures;\n\u25cf the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and the pace and extent of recovery when the pandemic subsides, which may vary materially over time and among the different regions and markets we serve; and\n\u25cf the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, trade relations, consumer behavior, our industry, and our business operations.\nThe above factors and risks, among others, are difficult to predict and could result in material adverse impacts to our business, operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, it is difficult to predict the potentially adverse impacts that COVID-19 could have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, which, in turn could materially and adversely impact our business.\nIn response to the spread of COVID-19, we have modified certain of our business practices (including store hours and access, employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates, customers, suppliers and business partners. We have also modified certain other parts of our operations during the pandemic, including by changing protocols for employee-customer interactions and customer traffic and imposing other restrictions or modifications in operations due to applicable legal or other requirements. These measures have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the customer experience, sales, and operations, and there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic. Further, the initiatives we have implemented to slow and/or reduce the impact of COVID-\n19 and the related support programs we have put in place for our associates and customers have in some instances, increased our operating expenses and reduced the efficiency of our operations. There can be no assurance that a continued effect of COVID-19 will not impact the measures we have taken to reduce costs.\nWe have incurred additional costs to meet the safety and needs of our associates and customers, including the installation of Plexiglas shields at pharmacy and front-end counters to provide additional protection, providing additional cleaning materials for our stores and other facilities, and focusing on home delivery and digital services. In addition, we have enhanced certain employee benefits and compensation for those on the front-line. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic. Additionally, a substantial number of our associates have transitioned to remote working environments as a result of the pandemic, which has increased risks for our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of business interruptions, increased risk for cybersecurity attacks, and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive, personal, proprietary, or confidential information.\nEfforts to mitigate COVID-19, have required and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources across the company and may delay other value added services. COVID-19 or any other adverse public health developments could inhibit or delay our ability to execute our strategic initiatives, including, without limitation (i) improving our PBM business, (ii) redefining the role of our pharmacists, (iii) updating our retail and digital experience; (iv) the roll-out of our future store concept, merchandising changes and rebranding efforts; and (v) our plan to increase the sales volume and profitability of our existing brands. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on our business may be impacted by the costs of treatment of COVID-19, unemployment, and the related effects on customer insurance coverage caused by governmental actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 or other adverse public health developments, including reduced demand for acute medication.\nWhile the FDA has authorized certain COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use, and vaccines have become more widely available, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the severity and duration of the pandemic, and the nature of the governmental response to it, remain unknown at this time. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business depends on numerous factors, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and are outside of our control, including new information concerning the severity of the virus, the scope of the outbreak and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and the disruption, the emergence of new, and potentially more infectious or deadly strains of the virus, the disruption of the vaccine supply chain and the reluctance of some to receive the vaccine which could result in prolonging the pandemic, the impact of stimulus legislation, volatility in the global capital markets, which may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, among others. The pandemic has also contributed to adverse conditions in the global economy and reduced expectations for the global economy, which could adversely affect our business as well as the businesses of many of our largest customers and other companies with which we do business. As a result, the impact on our financial and operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the impact could be material. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 could further exacerbate the impact of the other risk factors contained in this and the other reports the Company files with the SEC.\nWe are highly leveraged. Our substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary.\nWe had, as of February 27, 2021, approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness and stockholders\u2019 equity of $615.2 million. We also had additional borrowing capacity under our $2.7 billion senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d or \u201crevolver\u201d) of $1,643.1 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of approximately $122.0 million.\nOur high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations. Among other things, our indebtedness will:\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\u25cf limit our ability to reinvest in our business;\n\u25cf render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions; and\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt.\nOur ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, is dependent upon our ability to maintain our operating performance, which will be subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations.\nWe believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures through fiscal 2022 and have no significant debt maturities prior to December 2023. However, if our operating results, cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates rise significantly, we could face liquidity constraints. Additionally, we improved our leverage and liquidity position this past year by selling our rights in our calendar 2020 Medicare Part D final reconciliation payment. There can be no assurance that we will enter into a similar transaction for our calendar 2021 payment, or that if we do so, that the terms of such transaction will differ, and such differences could be material. If we are unable to service our debt or experience a significant reduction in our liquidity, we could be forced to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures and other initiatives, sell assets, restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital, or need to change certain elements of our strategy, and we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets and the economy may make it more difficult to consummate any such transaction, or result in terms that are less favorable to us. Our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions. Our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay our debts or refinance our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBorrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are based upon variable rates of interest, which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates or changes affecting the availability of LIBOR occur.\nBorrowings under our senior secured credit agreement, dated as of December 20, 2018 (as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of January 6, 2020, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), consisting of a $2,700.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (\u201cSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $450.0 million \u201cfirst-in, last out\u201d senior secured term loan facility (\u201cSenior Secured Term Loan\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cExisting Facilities\u201d) bear interest at a rate that varies depending on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). If LIBOR rises, the interest rates on borrowings under our Existing Facilities will increase. Therefore an increase in LIBOR, would increase our interest payment obligations under those borrowings and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition.\nFurther, in July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority which regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. In March 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator for LIBOR, confirmed its intention to cease publishing one week and two-month USD LIBOR after December 2021 and all remaining USD LIBOR tenors in mid-2023. Concurrently, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced the cessation or loss of representativeness of the USD LIBOR tenors from those dates. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market participants convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a rate calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities, as its recommended alternative benchmark rate to replace USD LIBOR. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than it has in the past, and it is expected that LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021 or mid-2023, as applicable. At this time, it is not known whether or when SOFR or other alternative reference rates will attain market traction as replacements for LIBOR. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact our contracts that terminate after 2021 or mid-2023, as applicable. There is uncertainty about how applicable law and the courts will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on variable rate retail loan contracts. After LIBOR ceases to exist, interest rates on future indebtedness may be adversely affected or we may need to renegotiate the terms of our\nExisting Facilities to replace LIBOR with the new standard benchmark rate that is established, if any, or to otherwise agree with the trustees or agents on a new means of calculating interest. In addition, changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness limit our ability to:\n\u25cf incur debt and liens;\n\u25cf pay dividends;\n\u25cf make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock;\n\u25cf make loans and investments;\n\u25cf prepay, redeem or repurchase debt;\n\u25cf engage in acquisitions, consolidations, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions;\n\u25cf change our business;\n\u25cf amend some of our debt and other material agreements;\n\u25cf issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u25cf restrict distributions from subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf grant negative pledges to other creditors.\nThe Credit Agreement has a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 (i) on any date on which availability under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is less than $200.0 million, or (ii) on the third consecutive business day on which availability under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is less than $250.0 million and, in each case, ending on and excluding the first day thereafter, if any, which is the 30th consecutive calendar day on which availability under the revolver is equal to or greater than $250 million. As of February 27, 2021, we had availability under our revolver of approximately $1,643.1 million, our fixed charge coverage ratio was greater than 1.00 to 1.00, and therefore, we were in compliance with the Credit Agreement\u2019s financial covenant. The Credit Agreement also limits our ability to maintain cash, without repaying a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, above a specified amount. For additional details, see the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations-Future Liquidity\u201d.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe need to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition, but our operations will not improve if we cannot effectively implement our business strategy or if our strategy is negatively affected by worsening economic conditions.\nWe have not achieved the sales productivity level of our major competitors. Improving our retail sales, prescription volumes and profitability at our PBM are essential to enable us to cover our fixed staffing costs and to\nimprove profitability and operating cash flow. If we are not successful in implementing our strategies, including our efforts to increase sales and further reduce costs, or if our strategies are not effective, we may not be able to improve our operations. A prolonged impact of COVID-19 may also make it more difficult to implement our strategies or cause a delay in such implementation. Furthermore, any adverse change or weakness in general economic conditions or major industries can adversely affect drug benefit plans and reduce our pharmacy sales. Adverse changes in general economic conditions, including those resulting from COVID-19, such as increased unemployment, could affect consumer buying practices and consequently reduce our sales of front-end products, and cause a decrease in our profitability. Failure to improve operations or weakness in major industries or general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt.\nWe purchase all of our brand and generic drugs from a single wholesaler. A disruption in this relationship may have a negative effect on us.\nWe purchase all of our brand drugs and, with limited exceptions, all of our generic drugs from a single wholesaler, McKesson. Because McKesson acts as a wholesaler for drugs purchased from manufacturers worldwide, any disruption in the supply of a given drug, including disruptions related to COVID-19 or to extreme weather or natural disasters, supply shortages of key ingredients, or regulatory actions by domestic or foreign governmental agencies, or specific actions taken by drug manufacturers, could adversely impact McKesson\u2019s ability to fulfill our demands, which could adversely affect us. Pharmacy sales represented approximately 66.7% of our total drugstore sales during fiscal 2021. While we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand name pharmaceuticals are readily available, a significant disruption in our relationship with McKesson could result in disruptions to our business until we execute a replacement wholesaler agreement or develop and implement self-distribution processes. We believe we could obtain qualified alternative sources, including through self-distribution, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, and accordingly that the impact of any disruption would be temporary, although the impact of COVID-19 could make it more challenging to find a suitable replacement on our then desired timeline. On February 28, 2019, we and McKesson entered into a contract that will continue our pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution partnership for an additional ten years. Under the terms, McKesson will continue providing us with sourcing and direct-to-store delivery for brand and generic pharmaceutical products through March 2029.\nRecent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such persons could have a material effect on our business. During the past several years we experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team, including a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, among others. These types of management changes have the potential to disrupt our operations due to the operational and administrative inefficiencies, added costs, increased likelihood of turnover, and the loss of personnel with vital institutional knowledge, experience and expertise, which could result in significant disruptions to our operations. In addition, we must successfully integrate the new executive leadership within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in key leadership positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new leadership becomes familiar with our business. We are currently engaging in these activities primarily on a work from home basis as a result of COVID-19.\nOur ability to attract and motivate talented employees is uncertain and poses financial risks.\nWe regularly compete with similar companies for talented employees and our success depends in part on attracting, retaining, and/or replacing key personnel with equally qualified employees. Given the ongoing risk of employee loss, we may occasionally need to increase salaries or experience increases in employment-related costs, which may reduce our revenue. We may also lose employees due to illness or other sudden occurrences, which makes succession planning difficult.\nLoss and/or transition of Company personnel, including senior executives, creates uncertainty as there is no guarantee that new personnel or leadership will adequately perform or smoothly transition into their new roles. Moreover, our investors, business partners, and employees prefer stability and any high level of employee turnover\ncould undermine stakeholder support. Ultimately, the unpredictability regarding employee continuity and potential disruption stemming from employee losses pose a threat to our overall financial condition and operations.\nFailure or significant disruption to our information technology systems/infrastructure or a cyber-security breach could adversely affect our operations.\nTechnology and computer systems are critical to many aspects of our pharmacy business, including, but not limited to, the drug supply chain, our dispensing of drugs, and our reimbursement. For instance, we rely extensively on computer systems used by Rite Aid, Elixir, Bartell Drugs, and Health Dialog, to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, inventory replenishment and other processes. Our computer systems are at risk for failures, security breaches, and natural disasters, and they have been subject to attack by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information. These sorts of attacks could subject our systems to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber security breaches, vandalism, coordinated cyber security attacks, severe weather conditions, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Although we deploy an information security program designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches through a multi-layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities, including ones from a cyber-security standpoint, a compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. We could also be adversely impacted by any significant disruptions in, or security breaches of, the systems and technology of third party suppliers or processors we interact with, including key payors and vendors with whom we share information including PHI. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or our data could also result in a violation of applicable privacy, information security, and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, fines or lawsuits, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. Although we maintain cyber security insurance, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance program will be adequate to protect us against future claims.\nTo effectively compete with our competitors and continue business partner relations, we must constantly invest in and update our technology and computer systems. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. We must ensure that our security operations are current and that our technology can properly interface with our business partners. These investments are costly, long-term, and unpredictable. There are risks that our technology investments will not be successful, will not provide a return on investment, and/or may fail or never be deployed. Oftentimes, we are implementing multiple updates or technology changes at the same time. We are currently in the process of changing our omni-channel distribution and there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement this technology on its intended timeline or that it will achieve its intended benefits.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technology, and we may accept new forms of payment over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. For\ncertain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to protect the security of personal information about our customers and associates, could result in significant business liability and reputational harm.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store certain personal information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on our web site, or otherwise communicate and interact with us, including in connection with our administration of COVID-19 vaccines. We may collect, maintain, and store information about our associates in the normal course of business and contract with third party business associates and vendors to accomplish these tasks. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, security could be compromised and confidential customer or business information misappropriated, for which we have paid related penalties in the past. Data breaches or violations of data protection laws may result in liability for the Company, even if caused, in whole or in part, by a business associate, vendor, or other third party. The unlawful handling or disclosure of sensitive personal information could also pose a serious risk to our customers\u2019 trust in the Company, including the unlawful handling or disclosure due to security breaches of the systems and technology of third party suppliers or processors that we interact with, including key payors and vendors with whom we share information including PHI, PII and personal credit card information (\u201cPCI\u201d). Ransomware attacks or loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, or result in governmental investigation and enforcement, sanctions, fines, and/or penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with more rigorous privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Our brand, reputation, and customer loyalty may be negatively impacted in the event of any personal information security failures. The occurrence or scope of any future data security failures are unpredictable, and it may prove difficult or impossible to fully mitigate or remediate their negative consequences. If we fail to comply or are alleged to have failed to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions or private lawsuits.\nAny inability to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places may have a negative impact on our operations.\nWe compete with other retailers and businesses to identify and develop desirable locations for retail store operations. Our ability to find suitable locations and our store construction, renovation, and operating costs can vary based on the specific state and locality and applicable zoning, environmental, and real estate laws. Additionally, construction delays, adverse modifications in lease terms, and changes in community demographics can negatively impact our store operations and revenues, and in some instances may cause us to close or relocate stores.\nA variety of business continuity hazards and risks could materially and adversely affect our and our vendors\u2019 business operations and our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.\nA variety of potential hazards, risks, and factors could adversely impact our and our vendors\u2019 operations and performance, including, but not limited to, health epidemics or pandemics like COVID-19 and the unexpected impact of\nmitigation efforts, such as social distancing, mask mandates and the delay of elective medical procedures, could have on the demand for cough, cold and flu products and acute prescriptions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, extended protests or periods of civil unrest, labor disputes, quality control issues, infrastructure failures, trade sanctions, inflation, changing market conditions, the introduction of new prescriptions drugs, the seasonal nature of our business, and changes in payor reimbursement rates and terms. These and other factors could also lead to disruptions in domestic and global supply chains and our ability to source products and find qualified vendors to access appropriate products in a timely and efficient manner. We could also be liable for any resulting personal injury or property damage arising from these risks to the extent our existing insurance coverage is insufficient or unavailable to cover associated losses. Due to these often unavoidable risks, some of which are beyond our management and control, our businesses, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis, and one or more of the above or other factors or risks could cause our results to fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and a single quarter\u2019s results may not provide reliable insight into our anticipated future performance.\nRisks Related to the Retail Pharmacy and PBM Industries in which we Operate\nThe markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us.\nIn the retail pharmacy business, we face intense competition with local, regional and national companies, including other drugstore chains, independently owned drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, dollar stores and internet pharmacies. Many of our competitors are larger, better capitalized, have access to greater financial and other resources, are diversified through other industries and have an international presence. Additionally, some of our competitors are vertically integrated, allowing them to leverage healthcare, health plan, and PBM operations together with their retail pharmacy footprint. Increasingly, these competitors are expanding in our existing markets. Greater competition exerts pressure on our pricing and promotional models and may force us to modify or reduce our prices.\nCompetition from grocers and on-line retailers has significantly increased during the past few years. Some of our competitors have or may merge with or acquire pharmacies, pharmaceutical services companies, PBMs, health insurance companies, specialty or mail order facilities and/or enter into strategic partnership alliances with Group Purchasing Organizations or wholesalers, which may further increase competition. We may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors have financial and other resources that are superior to ours.\nIn the PBM business, we also face competition from other PBMs, including large, national PBMs, PBMs owned by national health plans and smaller standalone PBMs. Certain of these competitors entered into the PBM industry before us, and there is no assurance that we will successfully compete with entities with more established PBM businesses and scale. Further, we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors. The ability of our stores to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of loyal, repeat customers.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to effectively compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition, or that any of our competitors are not in a better position to absorb the impact of COVID-19.\nOur market dynamics are subject to fluctuation due to consumer behavior and technology changes, among other factors. We must adjust our operations and business model to meet these evolving market demands. If we fail to make proper adjustments to meet changing market conditions, we may lose customers, which would have a negative impact on our revenue.\nIncreasingly, a greater volume or proportion of dispensed prescriptions involve specialty drugs, which are often furnished through limited distribution channels. Because these channels are restricted, there is substantial competition among out competitors to be included in these networks. Furthermore, participation in these networks is challenging, as\nthe higher costs and complexities of specialty drugs may be difficult to manage. If we are unable to effectively compete for specialty drug business and access this market, we face potential harm to our business operations and adverse impacts to our financial condition.\nA change in our pharmacy and payor mix could adversely affect our profit margins.\nOur Retail Pharmacy segment is subject to changes in pharmacy and payor mix, including shifts in pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering less favorable reimbursement terms, which could adversely affect the results of our operations. For instance, we anticipate that a growing number of prescription drug sales will involve government subsidized drug benefit programs, 90-day fill programs, and specialty drug sales, under which our business may receive lower margins. As our government-funded businesses grow, our exposure to changes in law and policy under those programs will increase. Also, the government could reduce funding for health care or other programs or cancel, decline to renew, or modify our contracts, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and cash flows. Moreover, many Medicare Part D plans and commercial payors are adopting preferred pharmacy networks, in which participating pharmacies must accept lower reimbursement in exchange for access to the payors\u2019 patient population. We could incur negative financial impacts should the terms and conditions of such preferred networks become less favorable or if we are unable to offset lower reimbursement with additional prescription volume, other business, or improved efficiencies. We could also be negatively impacted by changes in the relative distribution of drugs dispensed at our pharmacies between brands and generics or if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical products.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBMs, have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power, which has contributed to continued pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services and/or reduce our access to customers. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices and/or reduce our access to customers, our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our new strategy also includes selective acquisition opportunities and we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThere are risks related to the availability, pricing, and safety profiles of the pharmacy drugs and products we purchase and sell.\nThe continued conversion of various prescription drugs, including potential conversions of a number of popular medications, to over-the-counter medications may reduce our pharmacy sales and customers may seek to purchase such medications at non-pharmacy stores. Also, if the rate at which new prescription drugs become available slows or if new prescription drugs that are introduced into the market fail to achieve popularity, our pharmacy sales may be adversely affected. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the historic approval time for new drugs will not be impacted by the FDA\u2019s priorities in response to COVID-19. The withdrawal of certain drugs from the market, including COVID-19 vaccines, increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions, concerns about the safety or effectiveness of certain drugs, or negative publicity surrounding certain categories of drugs may also have a negative effect on our pharmacy sales or may cause shifts in our pharmacy or front-end product mix. Additionally, as we offer new products and services, our litigation and regulatory risk profile may change and increase our exposure to new risks that we have not previously encountered or addressed.\nThe availability of brand versus generic drugs and changes in those markets may also negatively impact our financial condition. Brand name drugs may become subject to inflation. Moreover, as generic drug utilization has increased, and due to consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry, our pharmacy business has\nexperienced decreasing profit margins on generic drug sales. If our businesses are unable to accommodate shrinking profit margins and decreased sales on certain prescription drug products, our costs, revenue and overall profits could be adversely and materially impacted.\nChanges in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs and changes in industry pricing benchmarks could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSales of prescription drugs reimbursed by third party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and state sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid plans, represented substantially all of our pharmacy sales in our Retail Pharmacy segment in fiscal 2021.\nThe continued efforts of Congress and Federal agencies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBM companies, other State and local government entities, and other third-party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation relating to how drugs are priced, may impact our profitability. These efforts may be increased as a result of increased deficits or sudden losses as a result of the impact of COVID-19. The competitive success of our pharmacy business is largely dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms as they may adopt narrow or restricted retail or specialty pharmacy networks. Some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict or exclude our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers. Any significant loss of third-party business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In particular, there has been a growth in the number of preferred Medicare Part D networks, many of which we are excluded from participating in. Decreased reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for brand and generic drugs has caused a reduction in our profit. Historically, the effect of this trend has been mitigated by our efforts to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals with manufacturers. Additionally, it has resulted in us providing contractual financial performance guarantees to certain of our PBM clients with respect to minimum drug price discounts for our retail pharmacy network and mail order pharmacy. Any inability to achieve guaranteed minimum drug price discounts provided to our PBM clients could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace Average Wholesale Price (\u201cAWP\u201d), which is the pricing reference used for many of our PBM client contracts, pharmaceutical manufacturer rebate agreements, retail pharmacy network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. Future changes to the use of AWP or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare programs and Medicaid health plans, the reimbursement we receive from PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers, acquisition discounts with wholesalers and retail discounts with network pharmacies. Likewise, Congress or the federal agencies could take actions that reduce or eliminate drug rebates obtained through negotiation with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time.\nDuring the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation, licensing and audits at both the federal and state levels. Efforts to control health care costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuing at the federal and state government levels. Changing political, economic and regulatory influences may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practices. A change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward programs offering lower reimbursement rates could negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy could significantly impact our business and the health care and retail industries. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur or what form any such changes may take, legislative proposals have been made that could have a material adverse effect on our business include, but are not limited to, the repeal of all or part of the ACA and other significant changes to health care system legislation as well as changes with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries.\nThe repeal of all or part of the ACA, significant changes to Medicaid funding or even significant destabilization of the Health Insurance Marketplaces could impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently,\nprescription drug coverage. Even if the ACA remains, significant provisions of the ACA have not yet been finalized (e.g., nondiscrimination in health programs and activities, excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage) and it is uncertain whether or in what form these provisions will be finalized. We cannot predict the effect, if any, a repeal of all or part of the ACA, the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provisions of the ACA, or the enactment of new health care system legislation to replace current legislation may have on our retail pharmacy and pharmacy services operations.\nA substantial portion of our pharmacy revenue is currently generated from a limited number of third party payors, and, if there is a loss of, or significant change to prescription drug reimbursement rates by, a major third party payor, our revenue will decrease and our business and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nA substantial portion of our pharmacy revenue is currently generated from a limited number of third party payors. While we are not limited in the number of third party payors with which we can do business and results may vary over time, our top five third party payors accounted for 77.9%, 79.9% and 80.4% of our pharmacy revenue during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The largest third party payor, Caremark, represented 30.4%, 28.8% and 28.3% of pharmacy sales during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that a limited number of third party payors will continue to account for a significant percentage of our pharmacy revenue, and the loss of all or a portion of, or a significant change to customer access or prescription drug reimbursement rates by, a major third party payor could decrease our revenue and harm our business.\nA substantial portion of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue is currently generated from a limited number of customers, and, if there is a loss of a major customer, our revenue will decrease and our business and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nA substantial portion of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue is currently generated from a limited number of customers. While we are not limited in the number of customers with which we can do business and results may vary over time, our top five customers accounted for 59.7%, 53.2% and 49.3% of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The largest payor, CMS, represented 36.6%, 27.4% and 23.0% of Pharmacy Services segment revenue during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our Pharmacy Services segment revenue, and the loss of all or a portion of a major customer could decrease our revenue and harm our business.\nWe are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We and/ or one or more of our subsidiaries are regularly involved in a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including arbitration, litigation (and related settlement discussions), and other claims, and are subject to regulatory proceedings including audits, inspections, inquiries, investigations, and similar actions by health care, insurance, pharmacy, tax and other governmental authorities. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive, and may exceed any applicable insurance coverage. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.\nFor example, we, along with certain of our chain pharmacy competitors, have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits relating to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioids, including in the consolidated federal multi-district litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), currently pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases that name us as a defendant also have been filed in numerous state court proceedings by any array of plaintiffs, including state Attorneys General, counties, cities, municipalities, Native American tribes, hospitals, third-party payors, and individuals. The Company has also received subpoenas, civil investigative demands, and other requests relating to opioid matters from the Department of Justice and several state Attorneys General.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Proceedings that we believe are insignificant may develop into material proceedings and subject us to unforeseen outcomes or expenses. Additionally, the actions of certain participants in our industry may encourage legal proceedings against us or cause us to reconsider our litigation strategies. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business practices.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements; our noncompliance or a significant legislative, regulatory, or public policy change could adversely affect our business, the results of our operations or our financial condition.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. Changes in these laws, regulations, or in related public policy may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including: (i) suspension of payments from government programs; (ii) loss of required government certifications; (iii) loss of authorizations or changes in requirements for participating in, or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iv) loss of licenses; or (v) significant fines or monetary penalties. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, federal, state and local registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine, among others; applicable Medicare and Medicaid Regulations; HIPAA; regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances; regulations enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws and federal and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy. We are also governed by federal and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of wage and hour laws, working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity.\nOur dealings with customers face scrutiny from the federal and state government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, who are charged with enforcing consumer protection laws and deterring alleged unfair or deceptive trade practices. Under these laws, regulated entities may be subject to legal action and government investigations in regards to a wide array of customer-facing matters, including product pricing and expiration, disability access, and member loyalty and other financial incentive programs. A failure to keep our customers adequately informed of our practices could result in government investigations or regulatory action which may result in potential fines and penalties.\nAdditionally, Congress passed the ACA in 2010, which resulted in significant structural changes to the health insurance system. However, in December 2017, the individual mandate was repealed. If the individual mandate repeal or a rollback of other aspects of the ACA, such as Medicaid expansion, actually leads to a significant reduction in demand for the healthcare services, the demand for our pharmacy services businesses may decline and could have a material impact on our business. A major legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Congress could take action to repeal, modify, or expand the ACA in the future. Therefore, we cannot predict what effect, if any, the repeal of all or part of the ACA or any subsequent replacement legislation may have on our retail pharmacy and pharmacy services businesses.\nGovernment audits, investigations, and reviews could lead to liability and operational changes.\nOur pharmacy, PBM, and PDP businesses are subject to periodic audits, investigations, and reviews from state and federal regulators and agencies. Health care laws and regulations, particularly within the pharmacy sector, are complex and subject to frequent change. Moreover, federal and state regulators are highly focused on and engage in vigorous enforcement efforts with regard to fraud, waste and abuse within the health care and pharmacy industry. Accordingly, we invest significant resources in our compliance efforts and must constantly re-evaluate our efforts, as the laws, regulations, and enforcement trends may change.\nBecause our business is subject to varied audits, investigations, and reviews, we face risks including financial penalties, civil and/or criminal liability, suspension or exclusion from government programs, and possible licensure sanction. For example, because our PDP is governed by CMS\u2019 audit authority, it could be subject to financial recoupment, penalties, beneficiary enrollment restrictions, and other forms of sanction. In addition, our PBM\u2019s operations could be indirectly and adversely impacted if any of its Medicare plan clients are subjected to adverse government audits or enforcement actions. The outcome of any given audit, investigation, and/or review could require significant changes to our business practices, revenue flow, and overall financial condition, with a resulting adverse impact on the Company as a whole.\nIf our compliance or other systems and processes fail or are deemed inadequate, we may become subject to regulatory actions and/or litigation.\nIn addition to Rite Aid being subject to extensive and complex regulations, many contracts that Elixir has with its customers impose compliance obligations on it. These compliance obligations frequently are reviewed and audited by Elixir\u2019s customers and regulators. More generally, if the Company\u2019s systems and processes designed to maintain compliance with applicable legal and contractual requirements, and to prevent and detect instances of, or the potential for, non-compliance fail or are deemed inadequate, we may be subject to regulatory actions, litigation and other proceedings which may result in damages, fines, suspension or loss of licensure, suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs and/or other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nCertain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services; our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us.\nPharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. In addition, federal and state laws that require our pharmacists to offer counseling, without additional charge, to customers about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common side effects and other information the pharmacists deem significant can impact our business. Our pharmacists may also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects. Although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance, from time to time, claims result in the payment of significant amounts, some portions of which are not funded by insurance. We cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims, or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liability for which we self-insure or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission.\nWe may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause injury, illness or death.\nProducts that we sell could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling or other damage requiring us to recall our products. In addition, errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell and we may be obligated to recall our products. Moreover, while we have insurance to cover potential product liability and some claims may be subject to indemnification from other parties, we cannot guarantee that our insurance limits and/or indemnification will be adequate to cover any and all product related claims. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. A product liability judgment against the Company or a product recall could have a material, adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks of declining gross margins in the PBM industry could adversely impact our profitability.\nThe PBM industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices, performance guarantees, enhanced service offerings and higher rebate yields. With respect to rebate yields, we maintain contractual relationships with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacy (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Manufacturer rebates often depend on a PBM\u2019s ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements, including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer\u2019s products on the PBM\u2019s formularies. If we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Further, changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, or to formulary management or other PBM services could also reduce or eliminate the manufacturer rebates we receive. We also have performance guarantees with select customers for rebates, and if our rebate aggregation contracts change or we are unable to meet our obligations due to mix of brand drugs, our financial performance for this business could be impacted.\nWe also maintain contractual relationships with participating pharmacies that provide for discounts on retail transactions for generic drugs and brand drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network. If we lose our relationship with one or more of the larger pharmacies in our network, or if the retail discounts provided by network pharmacies decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing, including our ability to collect network administration and technology fees, could adversely impact our profitability.\nLegislation exists under Medicare Part D and in the majority of states that affect the ability of our PBM business (and its health plan clients) to limit access to pharmacy provider networks or remove pharmacy network providers. For instance, \u201cany willing provider\u201d laws may mandate that our PBM or its health plan clients admit nonparticipating pharmacies that are willing and able to satisfy the applicable terms and conditions for network participation. Medicare Part D and many states have implemented laws or rules that limit the ability of PBMs and health plans to impose formulary conditions or restrictions, such as copayment differentials, and drug tiering designs, which may be used to manage drug benefits and promote cost-efficient utilization. Together, these laws could affect the ability of our PBM to effectively manage costs for its health plan clients. Additionally, many states now have legislation impacting the ability of our PBM to conduct audits of claims submitted by network pharmacies. These laws could hinder our PBM\u2019s ability to recover overpayments identified through audits and negatively affect our PBM\u2019s services and its ability to achieve enhanced economic outcomes for its health plan clients.\nThe possibility of PBM client loss and/or the failure to win new PBM business could impact our ability to secure new business.\nOur PBM business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. PBM client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration, so approximately one third of a PBM\u2019s client base typically is subject to renewal each year. In some cases, however, PBM clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract. In addition, the reputational impact of a service-related incident could negatively affect our ability to grow and retain our client base. Further, the PBM industry has been impacted by consolidation activity that may continue in the future. In the event one or more of our PBM clients is acquired by an entity that obtains PBM services from a competitor, we may be unable to retain all or a portion of our clients\u2019 business. Because of the competitive nature of the business, we continually face challenges in competing for new PBM business and retaining or renewing our existing PBM business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms. These circumstances, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nRegulatory or business changes relating to our participation in Medicare Part D, the medical loss ratio for our Medicare Part D eligible members, or our failure to otherwise execute on our strategies related to Medicare Part D, may adversely impact our business and our financial results.\nOne of our subsidiaries, Elixir Insurance, is an insurer domiciled in Ohio (with Ohio as its primary insurance regulator) and licensed in all 50 states, and is approved to function as a Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan (\u201cPDP\u201d) plan sponsor for purposes of individual insurance products offered to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries and for purposes of making employer/union-only group waiver plans available for eligible clients. We also provide other products and services in support of our clients\u2019 Medicare Part D plans or the Federal Retiree Drug Subsidy program. We are working to minimize the working capital tied to the business by reducing and/or selling the receivable as we did for calendar 2020, however there are no assurances that we can reduce or sell the receivable for calendar 2021. There are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the Medicare Part D program and we can give no assurance that these risks will not materially adversely impact our business and financial results in future periods.\nEI is subject to various contractual and regulatory compliance requirements associated with participating in Medicare Part D. EI is subject to certain aspects of state laws regulating the business of insurance in all jurisdictions in which EI offers its PDP plans. As a PDP sponsor, EI is required to comply with Federal Medicare Part D laws and regulations applicable to PDP sponsors. Additionally, the receipt of Federal funds made available through the Part D program by us, our affiliates, or clients is subject to compliance with the Part D regulations and established laws and regulations governing the Federal government\u2019s payment for healthcare goods and services, including the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act. Similar to our requirements with other clients, our policies and practices associated with operating our PDP are subject to audit. If material contractual or regulatory non-compliance was to be identified, monetary penalties and/or applicable sanctions, including suspension of enrollment and marketing or debarment from participation in Medicare programs, could be imposed. Further, the adoption or promulgation of new or more complex Medicare Part D regulatory requirements, including those governing pharmacy networks, benefit designs, and product pricing, could require us to incur significant costs which could adversely impact our business and our financial results. Similar negative impacts could result from potential Part D reimbursement reductions, adverse CMS audits, government enforcement actions, or decreases in star ratings. Further, EI\u2019s level of margin is limited by minimum Medical Loss Ratio (\u201cMLR\u201d) requirements imposed by the ACA. Medicare PDPs are subject to minimum MLR audits and EI could be required to pay MLR rebates for failure to meet minimum MLRs in a given year and repeated MLR failures could lead to CMS termination.\nIn addition, due to the availability of Medicare Part D, some of our employer clients may decide to stop providing pharmacy benefit coverage to retirees, instead allowing the retirees to choose their own Part D plans, which could cause a reduction in demand for our Medicare Part D group insurance products. Extensive competition among Medicare Part D plans could also result in the loss of Medicare Part D members by our managed care customers, which would also result in a decline in our membership base. For example, if we were to lose our current Star rating with the CMS, fewer customers may select our plans, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Like many aspects of our business, the administration of the Medicare Part D program is complex. Any failure to execute the provisions of the Medicare Part D program may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As discussed above, in March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform was enacted into federal law through the passage of the ACA. Additionally, as described above, the ACA contains various changes to the Part D program and could have a financial impact on our PDP and our clients\u2019 demand for our other Part D products and services. Further, a major constitutional challenge to the ACA is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court and it is unclear what effect, if any, the case and/or the potential repeal of all or part of the ACA may have on the Part D program.\nFailure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, an inability to expand the products being purchased by our clients and customers, or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services.\nThe success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty, superior customer service and our ability to persuade customers to purchase products in additional categories and our private label brands. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, an inability to expand the products being\npurchased by our clients and customers, or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular categories of products could negatively affect our relationship with our clients and customers and the demand for our products and services.\nWe offer our customers private label brand products that are available exclusively at our stores and through our online retail site. The sale of private label products subjects us to unique risks including potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls, our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and the rights of applicable third parties, and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell private-label products. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, an increase in the sales of our private label brands may negatively affect our sales of national-branded products which consequently, could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, that customer confidence is not diminished. Any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty.\nMoreover, customer expectations and new technology advances from our competitors have required that our business evolve so that we are able to interface with our retail customers not only face-to-face in our stores but also online and via mobile and social media. Our customers are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online, as well as to provide public reactions concerning each facet of our operation. If we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectations and new technology developments, our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected.\nFinally, Elixir\u2019s specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients. As a result, the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Any contraction of our base of patients or reduction in demand for the prescriptions we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of extreme events, natural disasters, and climate change could create unpredictability for our business operations.\nExtreme weather, natural disasters, and pandemics, such as COVID-19, can have severe negative ramifications for the pharmacy industry, including interfering with revenue flows, reimbursement, and the drug supply chain. More broadly, long-term climate change has unknown and potentially negative impacts on our industry. These sorts of extreme events can lead to unknown cost increases for our business to supply health care services and therefore pose a risk to our business and operating results.\nThe seasonal nature of our business causes fluctuations in operations.\nOur first and fourth fiscal quarter operation results generally fluctuate during the holidays, and cough, cold, and flu season, during which time we typically experience a larger proportion of retail sales and earnings as compared to other fiscal quarters. We increase our merchandise and inventory levels in anticipation of the holiday season, and there is a risk that unpredictable events, such as inclement weather, could impact retail sales and earnings during this time. Furthermore, the unpredictable timing and severity of the cough, cold, and flu season may impact our first and fourth fiscal quarter operation results, including in regards to prescription and non-prescription drug sales. Additionally, the continued impact of COVID-19 and the related mitigation efforts, such as social distancing, mask mandates and the delay of elective medical procedures, could further exacerbate our seasonal trends for the cough, cold and flu season and prescription sales.\nChanges in laws governing labor, employers, and union organizing may increase our labor costs.\nThe Company\u2019s business costs are directly impacted by legal and regulatory mandates governing employers and unionizing activities. Federal and state labor laws are subject to ongoing legislative changes, and any new or more stringent mandates imposed on employers, such as minimum wage increases or additional paid leave requirements, will\nincrease our costs as an employer. Our employee-related operating costs could also increase in response to any union organizing activities among our employees. Overall, these potential labor, wage and union-related changes could increase our operating costs and thereby negatively impact our financial condition.", "PERMNO": 46922, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "RAD"}
