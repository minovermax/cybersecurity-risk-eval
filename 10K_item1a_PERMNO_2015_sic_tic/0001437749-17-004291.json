{"cik": "934648", "company": "SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are all material known risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially adversely affect our business or cause our actual results to differ materially from results contemplated by forward-looking statements contained in this report or other public statements we may make. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business. Shareholders and prospective investors should carefully consider and evaluate all of our risk factors. However, many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or foresee, and undue reliance should not be put on forward-looking statements. Risk and other forward-looking factors, including future or forecasted results or events, may or may not ultimately be found correct. These risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended, supplemented, or superseded by updates contained in future periodic reports on Form 10-Q, Form 10-K or other forms we file with the SEC.\nThe United States and global economies, disruptions in the financial markets and geopolitical events could have a continued significant adverse impact on consumer and corporate spending and our business. Consumer and corporate spending can significantly impact our operating results, and national or local catastrophes, elevated terrorism alerts, fear of violence or attacks at large event gatherings, outbreaks of infectious diseases or natural disasters could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending. High or higher underemployment or unemployment, food and health care costs, income, sales, property and other tax rates, tight credit markets, difficult residential real estate and mortgage markets, and stock market volatility, among other factors, could dampen consumer and corporate spending, including adversely impacting disposable income and recreational and entertainment spending. Many fans from other countries, particularly Canada, travel to our speedways, particularly Las Vegas and New Hampshire. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can impact consumer spending sentiment and travel decisions, particularly when unfavorable relative to US currency as Canada\u2019s is at this time. Such reduced spending may continue to negatively impact our admissions, sponsorship, advertising and hospitality spending, concession and souvenir sales demand, luxury suite, and other event related revenues, with related effects on our motorsports and non-motorsports activities and future revenues, profitability and cash flows. These and other similar factors could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operations.\nWhile the direction and strength of the United States economy appear to be improving, uncertainty remains as to its recovery strength and duration, as well as for other foreign countries. Government responses and actions may or may not successfully restore prolonged stability to the credit and consumer markets or improve long-term economic conditions. State and federal budgetary deficits could result in government responses such as higher consumer and corporate income or other tax rates. Governmental spending deficits or actions by the Federal Reserve Bank could also lead to higher interest rates, inflation increases and difficult borrowing conditions for consumers and corporate customers. Should financial market and lending conditions lead to negative interest rates similar to other foreign countries, the possible negative consequences are largely unknown but might be substantial. Furthermore, the recent Presidential election in the United States could result in significant changes or uncertainty in governmental policies, regulatory environments, spending sentiment and many other factors and conditions, some of which could adversely impact our operations. Possible changes in governmental taxing, regulatory, spending and other policies could significantly impact consumer spending, economic recovery and our future results. The economy or financial and credit markets might not continue to improve or stabilize for long periods or could worsen.\nOther factors that can affect consumer and corporate spending include hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters, elevated terrorism alerts or fear of violence, terrorist attacks, military actions, air travel concerns, and geopolitical events, as well as various industry and other business conditions. Incidents such as the 2015 Paris attacks and 2013 Boston bombings, or outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Ebola, Zika or other pandemics, can affect public concerns regarding large gatherings of people, including travel to large populated venues or locations. Additional incidents could have a particularly significant negative impact on attendance and other event related spending by individuals or corporate fans and customers who have or might have planned to attend one or more of our racing events. Such factors or incidents, even if not directly impacting us, can disrupt or otherwise adversely impact the financial results, spending sentiment and interest of our present or potential customers. These factors can adversely impact local, regional and national consumer and corporate spending sentiment. Each of these aforementioned negative factors, and particularly when combined, may adversely impact corporate and individual customer spending and have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and growth.\nBad weather or postponement or cancellation of motorsports events could adversely affect us.\nWe promote outdoor motorsports events. Weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets, concessions and souvenirs, driving schools and track rentals, among other things. Although we sell many tickets in advance of our events, poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly because we promote a limited number of premier events. Due to inclement weather conditions, we may be required to move a race event to the next raceable day. Poor weather leading up to, or forecast for a weekend that surrounds, a race can negatively impact our advance sales and walk-up admissions and food, beverage and souvenir sales. Poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success or experience of past events.\nWhen events are delayed, postponed or rescheduled because of weather (or if due to national security concerns, natural disasters or other reasons), we typically incur additional operating expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event, as well as generate lower admissions, food, beverage and souvenir revenues. If an event is cancelled, we would incur expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event, as well as losing associated event revenues, including live broadcast revenues, to the extent such losses were not covered by insurance. If a cancelled event is part of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup, Xfinity or Camping World Series, amounts we receive from television revenues for all of our NASCAR events in the series that experienced cancellation could be reduced. This would occur if, as a result of cancellation and without regard to whether the cancelled event was scheduled for one of our facilities, NASCAR experienced a reduction in television revenues in excess of amounts scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the cancelled event.\nLack of competitiveness in Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races or closeness of championship points races, the popularity of race car drivers or changes made by NASCAR on conducting, promoting and racing as a series sanctioning body, can significantly impact our operating results.\nA lack of competitiveness in Monster Energy Cup Series races or the closeness of the championship points race, race car driver popularity, and the success of NASCAR racing in general, in any particular racing season can significantly impact our operating results. Various performance factors of racing competitors, particularly popular drivers, can affect on-track competition and the appeal of racing. New or changed racing teams could be formed with drivers that generate less fan interest or race less competitively. As further discussed in \u201cBusiness - Industry Overview\u201d, NASCAR as a sanctioning body periodically implements new rules or technical and other required changes for race teams and drivers and event promoters in attempts to increase safety, racing competition, and fan and media interest, among other things. These and other periodically implemented changes may or may not become more successful or popular with fans. Such factors can affect attendance and other event related revenues for our NASCAR and other racing events, corporate interest, media attention, and the promotional marketing appeal for these series, as well as other events surrounding the weekends races are promoted. Rule changes can increase operating costs that we may or may not be able to control. There can be no assurance these factors will not have an adverse impact on our attendance or other event related revenues, or that operating costs will not be adversely impacted by sanctioning body changes in any particular season.\nWe compete with improving and expanding non-motorsports related media coverage and content by network and cable broadcasters, and with ongoing improvements in high-definition television technology - both of which are increasingly influenced by changing demographics and could adversely affect us.\nSimilar to what other motorsports competitors and many other sporting venues are experiencing, we believe that a portion of the decline in attendance over the past few years can be attributed to changing demographics. While our long-time fans are more important to us than ever, we recognize the importance of capturing the next generation of race fans as the average age of the general population and our traditional fan base increase, and multicultural consumer groups grow. New and expanding entertainment media options and content are continually being developed and marketed to attract the changing demographics, particularly outside of motorsports. And as importantly, we are increasingly competing with improving and expanding non-motorsports related media coverage and content by network and cable broadcasters, and with ongoing improvements in high-definition television technology and increasing DVR use and on-demand content, particularly for Monster Energy Cup and Xfinity Series racing events.\nWe, NASCAR and the television broadcasters continue to make sizable investments in new and expanding marketing initiatives and leading-edge facility improvements that appeal to younger fans and the changing demographics. We are increasingly investing in new marketing approaches and technology to foster attendance by families, particularly those with younger children and teenagers. We are also increasingly investing in social media, web-based applications and interactive digital systems to enhance pre-race and during-the-race entertainment experiences that appeal to our younger demographic markets. Some of our recent larger investments include installation of three large high-definition video boards at BMS, CMS and TMS. There can be no assurance that our various initiatives, and those of NASCAR or the television broadcasters, individually or in combination, will successfully increase attendance, event related revenues or corporate or individual marketing appeal or interest in our sport or venues.\nStrong competition in the motorsports industry, with other professional, collegiate and amateur sports, and with new and expanding non-motorsports entertainment alternatives could hinder our ability to maintain or improve our position in the industry.\nMotorsports promotion is a competitive industry. We compete in local, regional and national markets, and with ISC and other NASCAR related speedways to promote events, especially Monster Energy NASCAR Cup and Xfinity Series events and, to a lesser extent, with other speedway owners to promote other NASCAR, IndyCar, NHRA and WOO events. We believe our principal competitors are other motorsports promoters of Monster Energy Cup and Xfinity Series or equivalent events. NASCAR is owned by the France family, who also controls ISC. ISC presently hosts a significant number of Monster Energy Cup and Xfinity Series races. Our competitors may attempt to build speedways and conduct racing and other motorsports related activities in new markets that may compete with us and our local and regional fan base or marketing opportunities.\nWe compete for spectator interest and consumer and corporate spending with all forms of professional, collegiate and amateur spring, summer and fall sports, such as football, baseball, basketball, soccer and hockey conducted in and near Atlanta, Boston, Bristol, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Dallas-Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Lexington, Louisville, and San Francisco, and locally, regionally and nationally. We also compete for spectator interest and consumer and corporate spending with non-sports related venues and events such as concerts, shows and a widening range of other available entertainment and recreational activities in those same geographical areas. New and expanding entertainment venues and activities are continually being developed and marketed to attract the changing demographics, particularly outside of motorsports. These competing events and activities may be held on the same days or weekends as our events. Many of those sports and non-sports competing promoters have resources that exceed ours.\nFailure to be awarded a NASCAR event, deterioration in our relationship with NASCAR or substantial changes in financial terms of Event Management Fees could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur success has been, and remains to a significant extent, dependent upon maintaining a good working relationship with organizations that sanction races we promote at our facilities, particularly NASCAR, the sanctioning body for Monster Energy Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck Series races. In October 2015, SMI entered into separate five-year Event Management Agreements (formerly Purse and Sanction agreements) with NASCAR, under which our speedways would conduct Monster Energy NASCAR Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck Series and the All-Star Race events beginning in 2016 and through 2020. Although we believe our relationship with NASCAR is good, nonrenewal of a NASCAR event license or substantial changes in the associated financial terms could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to obtain NASCAR licenses to sponsor races, or with acceptable financial terms, at our facilities beyond those currently under contract.\nRelocation, failure to relocate, or other scheduling changes in holding our motorsports events could adversely affect us.\nWe may evaluate or attempt to realign one or more Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (or other motorsports series) race dates among our multiple track facilities, or change the quarterly periods in which the same number of race dates are held each year. Many factors and alternatives must be considered when moving races, including the popularity and profitability of various races, relative speedway seating capacity, alternative speedway uses and revenues, costs of any capital expenditures to upgrade or expand facilities, lead time required to complete any upgrades or expansion, alternative uses of capital, existing or potential governmental tax incentives, changing economic conditions for the individual speedway or economy as a whole, as well as various other strategic issues. NASCAR has previously stated it would consider potential track realignment of Monster Energy Cup Series racing events to desirable, potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators, but is not obligated to do so. Similarly, NASCAR is not obligated to modify its race schedules to allow us to schedule our races more efficiently or favorably.\nHowever, as further described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity\", we recently obtained approval from NASCAR to realign annual Monster Energy Cup Series and Camping World Truck Series racing events from NHMS, and an annual Xfinity Series racing event from KyS, to LVMS beginning in 2018. The planned realignment may have a material impact on our annual cash flow cycles beginning in 2017 and our operating results after 2017. Relocation or changes in calendar periods of our larger events held among our speedways, and particularly Monster Energy Cup racing events, could result in a net increase or decrease in our future operating profitability. The profitability of Monster Energy Cup and other events that are relocated or held in changed periods could be less than management anticipated, resulting in a net decrease in our future results of operations and cash flows. Also, long-lived assets of a speedway from where a Monster Energy Cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations. Different economic or industry conditions or assumptions, changes in projected cash flows or profitability, if significantly negative or unfavorable, or actual race date realignments that differ significantly from those assumed in any impairment evaluation, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluations and future financial condition or results of operations.\nOur NASCAR broadcasting rights revenues are significant and changes could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nOur NASCAR broadcasting rights revenues are significant multi-year contracted revenue and cash flow sources for us. Any significant adverse changes to such rights revenues could adversely impact our results. As further discussed in \u201cBusiness - NASCAR Broadcasting Rights\u201d, NASCAR reached ten-year, multi-platform and media partnership agreements with FOX Sports Media Group and NBC Sports Group beginning in 2015 through 2024. These ten-year broadcasting agreements are anticipated to provide us annual contracted revenue increases averaging almost 4% per year, with total contracted NASCAR broadcasting revenues of approximately $232 million in 2017. Future changes in race schedules could impact broadcasting revenues. Similar to many televised sports, overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year, and television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons. NASCAR ratings can impact attendance at our events and sponsorship opportunities.\nChanges in security and safety rules, regulations or needs could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur protective efforts and activities related to spectator security and safety are substantial. Those concerns and efforts continue to evolve and expand, and sanctioning bodies for many of our events continue to impose expanded or stricter rules and requirements for protecting race and other event participants. Sanctioning bodies could impose additional safety or security measures or requirements that involve significant capital expenditures or increased operating expenses. Many other sporting venues involving large public gatherings continue to increase their public safety and security measures before and during events. We have increased, and may continue to further increase, our safety and security efforts and activities whether or not mandated by sanctioning bodies. The substantial costs of security and enhanced prevention activities, including protective measures for drivers or fans, may continue to increase and adversely impact our future financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased costs associated with, and inability to obtain, adequate insurance and the risks of partial self-insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our eight speedway facilities, which are generally located near highly populated cities and hold events typically attended by large numbers of fans. These operational, geographical and situational factors, among others, can result in high or increasing insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits, which could adversely impact our future financial condition or results of operations.\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedways and other properties and motorsports events and other business risks. We may increase the marketing of certain products using self-insured promotional warranty programs that could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number and amount of claims significantly increase. We have increased and may further increase our self-insurance limits, which could subject us to increased risk of loss should the number of incidents, damages, casualties or other claims below such self-insured limits increase. Management cannot guarantee that the number of uninsured losses will not increase. An increase in the number of uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position or results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate if a catastrophic event occurred or major motorsports events were cancelled, and liability for personal injuries and product liability claims could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement attempts to obtain, and believes we presently have, reasonable policy limits of property, casualty, liability, cyber attack and business interruption insurance, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with financially sound insurers. However, we cannot guarantee that our policy limits or coverage currently in force would be adequate should one or multiple catastrophic events occur at or near any of our speedway facilities, or one or more of our major motorsports events were cancelled. Once our present coverage expires, we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available, offered at reasonable costs, or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness. The occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our speedway facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position and results of operations if our asset damage or liability was to exceed insurance coverage limits or an insurer was unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages. The occurrence of regional or national incidents, in particular incidents at sporting events, entertainment or other public venues, could significantly impair our ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future.\nMotorsports can be dangerous to participants and to spectators. We believe we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient to protect us from material financial loss due to liability for personal injuries sustained by persons on our premises in the ordinary course of business. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times or in all circumstances.\nThe financial stability of certain insurance companies that provide our insurance coverage could be adversely affected by economic, geopolitical and other events or conditions as further discussed above. In that case, the ability of these insurance companies to pay our potential claims could be impaired, and we might not be able to obtain adequate replacement insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all. Any of these events could harm our business, and we cannot provide assurance that future increases in such insurance costs and difficulties in obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our future financial position or results of operations.\nThe loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations and growth.\nOur success depends to a great extent upon the availability and performance of our senior management. Their experience within the industry, especially their working relationship with NASCAR, continues to be of considerable importance to us. The loss of any of our key personnel due to illness, retirement or otherwise, or our inability to attract and retain key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business plans.\nWe may make significant expenditures for capital projects and investments, and costs and uncertainties associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur Credit Facility allows for annual capital expenditures of up to $75.0 million, and provides for additional borrowings of up to $99.4 million as of December 31, 2016 subject to meeting specified conditions. We may make material capital improvements over several years in amounts that have not yet been determined. The cost, profitability, timing or success of future capital projects and investments is subject to numerous factors, conditions and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in or denials of government approvals or permits\n\u2022\nundetected soil or land, including environmental conditions\n\u2022\nadditional land acquisition costs\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of construction materials and labor\n\u2022\nunforeseen changes in design\n\u2022\nlitigation, accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site\n\u2022\nnational or regional economic, regulatory or geopolitical changes\nSignificant negative or unfavorable outcomes could reduce our available cash and cash investments or our ability to service current or future indebtedness, require additional borrowings resulting in higher debt service and interest costs, lower our ratings by credit agencies, increase our difficulties in borrowing additional amounts, cause higher than anticipated depreciation expense, among other negative consequences, and could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nShould projects be abandoned or substantially decreased in scope due to unforeseen negative factors, we could be required to expense some or all previously capitalized costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. Also, should improvement projects not produce a sufficient economic yield, including those requiring demolition of speedway facility components, or where capitalization of demolition, construction and historical component costs are limited to a revised estimated project value, capitalized expenditures could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge and adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture impairment of our property and equipment or other intangible assets and goodwill, and future changes in asset depreciation periods, could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have net property and equipment of $1.0 billion, net other intangible assets of $298.4 million and goodwill of $47.3 million. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets for possible impairment, and our evaluation methodology, assumptions, and results are further described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe no unrecognized impairment exists at December 31, 2016. Different conditions, trends or assumptions or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation. Should our reporting units or their indefinite-lived intangible assets not achieve projected cash flows or profitability, or should actual capital expenditures exceed current plans, estimated fair values could be reduced to below carrying values resulting in material non-cash impairment charges and adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations. The evaluations are subjective and based on conditions, trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation.\nFrom time to time, we may decide to repurpose lower demand seating areas and suites at certain speedways to help manage facility capacity, improve sightlines, expand viewing areas, and convert space for alternative marketing uses or other reasons. We may incur significant expenditures to demolish or convert such seating, including associated grandstand areas, in years and amounts that have not yet been determined. Such expenditures may or may not increase our future success and profitability, which depends on many factors outside of management\u2019s control. As further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded significant non-cash charges for accelerated depreciation related to removal of certain low demand seating and suites in 2014 and 2015, and anticipate similar charges in the first quarter 2017.\nNotwithstanding such charges, the depreciable carrying values for our grandstands and suites are material. Depending on management\u2019s plans, we could be required to accelerate or shorten depreciation periods or write off remaining undepreciated net book value of associated assets, or expense the costs of demolition and disposal, all or some of which could have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions, projects or other development activities, and efficient and successful integration into our operations.\nFrom time to time, we pursue acquisitions, projects and other development activities, or joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy, which may involve significant challenges and risks. For example, transactions may not advance our business strategy or we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investments or activities. We may experience difficulty integrating new employees, business systems and technology, or management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our other businesses or operations. Also, our use of cash or additional borrowings to fund such transactions or activities could significantly impact our liquidity, impair our ability to borrow additional funds for other business purposes, or cause lowered ratings by credit agencies resulting in higher borrowing costs or increased difficulties borrowing additional amounts, among other things. These factors could adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may continue to significantly improve our speedway facilities, involving material capital expenditures over several years in amounts or nature that have not yet been determined. Such expenditures may or may not increase our future success and the ability to compete and operate successfully and profitably depends on many factors outside of management\u2019s control. Management may from time to time evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer be in alignment with our strategic direction. We may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or we may dispose of or sell a business or assets at a price or on terms that are less than optimal or whose subsequent performance exceeds expectations. These factors could adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position, our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments, and our ability to pay dividends.\nWe have substantial amounts of debt and debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2016, we had total outstanding long-term debt of approximately $267.2 million as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our substantial indebtedness and leverage could make it more difficult and costly to borrow money, and may reduce funds available for financing our operations and other business activities and have other important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payment of principal, debt redemption, interest costs, reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, and other corporate purposes\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust to adverse or changing market conditions and withstand competitive pressures could be limited, and we may be vulnerable to additional risk in difficult general economic or other market conditions\n\u2022\nwe may be at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less leverage and greater operating and financial flexibility\n\u2022\nour debt levels may increase our interest costs or reduce our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing or obtain financing at acceptable rates or terms\n\u2022\nour debt levels may cause lowered ratings by credit agencies, resulting in higher borrowing costs or increased difficulties borrowing additional amounts\nEach or all of the factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nServicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nA significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our indebtedness and is therefore not available for other use in our business. In 2016, we paid $13.3 million in interest on our indebtedness. Our ability to make debt service payments depends on our future ability to generate sufficient cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, legislative, regulatory, industry, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our operations are substantially impacted by the success of NASCAR in the promotion and conduct of racing as a sanctioning body, our relationship with NASCAR, the popularity of NASCAR and other motorsports generally, and the impact of competition. Although under our control, our cash outlays for dividends are funded in part with cash that would otherwise be available for capital spending, repurchases of common stock or other liquidity needs. Also, any future dividend increases would further limit cash otherwise available for such uses or needs. Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to pay our indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity.\nOur future borrowing costs on current or future indebtedness could substantially increase, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total outstanding long-term debt of approximately $267.2 million and our revolving Credit Facility permits additional borrowings of up to $99.4 million. Our operating results have benefited from relatively low interest rates on our floating rate Credit Facility and future increases, if significant, could have a significant adverse impact on our future results. Our future capital spending or investments could significantly increase our future outstanding debt. Also, our future interest and borrowing costs under our Credit Facility or any refinanced or additional debt could substantially increase and adversely affect our financial condition or profitability. We are currently unable to predict if or when interest rates could change. Our significant indebtedness levels and leverage could result in higher interest and other borrowing costs and more restrictive financial and other loan covenants under any new credit facility or other borrowing arrangements.\nAs further discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, interest rates under our Credit Facility are based on specified tier levels that are adjustable periodically based upon certain consolidated total leverage ratios. Our current planned or unplanned future capital spending and possible increases in our future outstanding indebtedness, along with our current leverage, could further reduce the amounts by which we exceed minimum required covenant compliance levels and result in changes to our interest cost tier levels. Future changes in such surplus in our compliance levels or interest cost tiers could result in increased interest costs on current or future indebtedness, restricted or reduced borrowings and availability under our Credit Facility, and increased costs for any new borrowings or financing. Each or all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nRestrictions imposed by terms of our indebtedness could limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to secure additional financing.\nThe indenture for the 2023 Senior Notes and our Credit Facility agreement restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to do any of the following:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or liens\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments\n\u2022\napply net proceeds from certain asset sales\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate\n\u2022\nsell equity interests of subsidiaries, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of assets\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness subordinate in right-of-payment to any senior indebtedness or senior in right-of-payment to the 2023 Senior Notes\nBecause of our significant outstanding indebtedness, debt covenant compliance is important to our operations. Our Credit Facility is the primary source of committed funding for our planned capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, repurchases of our common stock and working capital needs. Our Credit Facility contains more extensive and restrictive covenants than our 2023 Senior Notes, and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios as further described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\u201d.\nFailure to comply with any covenant could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. Non-compliance with financial covenant ratios or other covenants could prevent us from further borrowings or require repayment under our Credit Facility. Our ability to meet those covenants, financial ratios and tests can be affected by material impairment or other charges, declines in profitability or cash flows or other economic or market factors beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those tests. Our Credit Facility and 2023 Senior Notes contain cross-default provisions. A default under any of these debt agreements could likely trigger cross-default provisions. Lenders, in each case, could be allowed to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements, including declaring all amounts outstanding, accrued interest or other obligations to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay these amounts, such lenders could proceed against collateral, if any, securing that indebtedness. If any indebtedness was accelerated, there can be no assurance that we could repay or refinance accelerated amounts due.\nUnder these covenants, our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and secure additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted. We may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. Should we pursue further development or acquisition opportunities, the timing, size and success, as well as associated potential capital commitments of which are unknown at this time, we may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings. There can be no assurance that adequate debt and equity financing will be available if and when needed, on satisfactory terms or permitted under our debt arrangements. Failure to obtain further financing could have a negative effect on our business and operations.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we may be permitted to incur significant additional debt in the future. Also, we may be able to secure additional debt with Company, subsidiary or new business assets. Furthermore, any new financing arrangements may contain additional restrictive and financial covenants. These covenants may restrict or prohibit many actions including, but not limited to, our ability to incur debt, create liens, prepay debt, pay dividends, limit capital expenditures, investments or transactions with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital stock, sell certain assets, or engage in mergers, consolidations or other transactions. Failure to maintain compliance with any new covenants could constitute a default, which could accelerate payment due of any or all amounts outstanding under new or existing debt agreements.\nGovernment regulation, political sensitivities or public attention of certain motorsports sponsors could negatively impact the availability of promotion, sponsorship and advertising revenue for us.\nThe motorsports industry generates significant revenue each year from the promotion, sponsorship and advertising of various companies and their products, some of which are subject to government regulation. Advertising of alcoholic beverages, tobacco and firearms is generally subject to greater governmental regulation, political sensitivities or public attention than advertising by other sponsors of our events. Certain of our sponsorship and other marketing contracts are terminable upon the implementation of adverse regulations. These industries have provided substantial financial support to the motorsports industry through, among other things, advertising time purchases, racing team sponsorship and past sponsorship of racing series such as the Winston Cup (now Monster Energy Cup) Series and the Busch (now Xfinity) Series. We cannot assure you that these or other regulated industries will continue to sponsor motorsports events or participate in other promotional activities, suitable alternative sponsors will be located, or NASCAR will continue to sanction individual racing events involving such industries or promotional activities. Implementation of further restrictions on the advertising or promotion of these industries or their products could adversely affect us.\nFailure to maintain adequate security for certain customer-related information could damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, subject us to litigation or adverse regulatory actions or cause us to incur substantial additional costs.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store certain financial and other information from individuals, corporations and others, including customers, employees and outside contractors. We process customer payment card information, perform credit, employment and other business related inquiries, and collect customary information used for marketing purposes. We contract with third parties for processing orders and payments of a large portion of our tickets and other access sold for our events, much of which is transacted indirectly through links with our external or partner websites. Our online operations depend upon secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting and transacting cashless payments. Also, Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) data security standards continue to increase, along with tougher compliance requirements. Our security measures are increasingly costly as new prevention and detection technologies emerge in response to ongoing and rapid changes in cyber-terrorism and other system intrusion efforts advance. We commit significant internal and external resources to network security, data encryption, PCI security standards compliance and other security measures to protect our networks and data, but there can be no assurance these security measures provide complete security. We attempt to limit exposure to security breaches and sensitive customer data through the use of \u201ctokens\u201d in certain processing applications, which is an industry best practice that does not require storage of credit card numbers.\nAs with all entities, security measures are subject to third-party security hardware and software soundness, employee and consultant errors or intentional harmful actions and other unforeseen factors or circumstances. Our or third-party networks could be breached and we could be unable to protect sensitive data. A breach of our security networks that results in personal, corporate or other sensitive information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with current or prospective customers, credit and debit card processers and others. Such security breaches could result in litigation against us, adverse regulatory or credit card processer actions, restrictions or imposing substantial penalties or fines. Also, a security breach could require or result in us spending significant additional resources on our information security systems and could disrupt our operations, particularly sales and marketing. Notwithstanding the absence of any security breach, our failure to maintain compliance with PCI security standards could result in significant penalties, fines, increased processing costs or discontinued card acceptance by processors. While we maintain cyber liability insurance, certain losses may not be covered. Any significant breach could have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nResults and costs attributable to the extraction of natural gas are uncertain.\nAs further discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our TMS subsidiary is the lessor in a natural gas mineral rights lease agreement and joint exploration agreement under which the lessee has various exploration and extraction rights and TMS shares in the production revenues. Drilling natural gas wells involves numerous risks and our revenues and royalties from such operations may be impacted as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in price levels\n\u2022\navailability of commercially productive natural gas reserves on the premises\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions\n\u2022\ncompliance with, or changes in, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of natural gas, and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations\n\u2022\nthe availability and timely issuance of required federal, state, tribal and other permits and licenses\n\u2022\nthe availability of, and costs associated with, third-party contractual arrangements\n\u2022\nthe costs of, or shortages or delays in availability of, necessary facilities, equipment, materials, supplies, services and personnel\nThe lessee began drilling activities prior to 2014, and TMS received royalty and related payments of $2.1 million in 2016 and $4.3 million in 2015. Such revenues have declined recently from associated market declines and volatility in natural gas price levels. At this time, while extraction activities continue, no new wells are being explored, and there can be no assurance as to possible ongoing volumes of production if any or for how long (including common diminishing well production over time), or if natural gas price levels will further decline, remain steady or adequate. The agreements stipulate the sharing of production revenues, and obligate TMS to spend amounts equal to royalties received on TMS facility and road infrastructure improvements beginning in 2017, up to specified cumulative amounts. Management is unable to determine the amounts, if any, or timing of possible future royalty payments to TMS or obligated spending on infrastructure by TMS.\nOur Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and their family own a majority of our common stock and will control any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\nAs of March 10, 2017, Mr. O. Bruton Smith, our Executive Chairman, and Mr. Marcus G. Smith, our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, an aggregate of approximately 29 million shares or 70% of our common stock. As a result, they will continue to control the outcome of issues submitted to our stockholders, including the election of all directors. As a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE rules, we also qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that we have nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees composed entirely of independent directors. Although we qualify, we do not currently use this \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption.\nOur large net deferred tax liabilities, changes in income tax laws, or changes or revisions to our income tax reporting could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs further described in our \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates\u201d and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities are material to our current and future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2016, net deferred tax liabilities totaled $329.4 million, including deferred tax assets of $15.7 million. At December 31, 2016, valuation allowances of $1.7 million have been provided against deferred tax assets because management has determined that ultimate realization is not more likely than not. These net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in years in which reversal occurs. The associated accounting and reporting for income taxes is complicated and based on significant assumptions, estimates and judgement. Numerous factors are involved in assessing and adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Our accounting for income taxes also involves our best estimate of future events.\nAt December 31, 2016, liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $12.0 million. Should those tax positions not be fully sustained if examined, an acceleration of material income taxes payable or refundable could occur. Where no net income tax benefit had been previously reflected because of providing a valuation allowance on related deferred tax assets, our future results of operations might not be significantly impacted. However, resulting cash required for payments of income taxes could be material in the period in which such determination is made. Similar to many entities, management periodically uses various tax strategies to manage cash income taxes payable where possible. Our cash paid for income taxes in recent years has been significantly reduced through use of various tax minimization strategies and income tax benefits. While management plans to minimize income taxes payable in future years where possible, the amount and timing of cash income taxes ultimately paid are subject to many factors that are not yet determinable. Income tax benefits may no longer be available, resulting in a significant increase in required cash payments for income taxes, particularly after 2016.\nDifferences between final tax outcomes and amounts recorded can affect our income tax provision in periods such determinations are made. Changes in tax laws, assumptions, estimates or methods used in the accounting for income taxes, or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement. Such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties. Any differences between the final tax outcome and amounts recorded would affect our income tax provision in the period in which such determination was made, and could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe recognized an anticipated tax benefit of $48.1 million related to abandonment of our Motorsports Authentics (\u201cMA\u201d) equity investment as of December 31, 2013 for the reversal of previously recorded valuation allowances under applicable accounting guidance. The technical merits, accounting treatment and conclusions reached on our tax position are further described in Notes 2 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are not repeated here. As a result of abandonment, we recognized tax losses that were reported on our 2014 income tax returns. We have reduced income taxes payable by amounts approximating that tax benefit through December 31, 2016 by utilization of deferred income tax assets, including net operating losses, related to abandonment. We believe it is more likely than not that the filing position would be sustained. However, should our tax position not be fully sustained upon examination, reestablishment of material income tax liabilities and acceleration of cash income taxes payable could be required. Any differences between the final tax outcome and amounts recorded would affect our income tax provision in the period in which such determination was made, and could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the United States, subject to significant change. There have been proposals to reform US tax laws that could significantly impact how corporations are taxed. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form such proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have a material impact on our income tax expense, cash flows and deferred tax liabilities.\nEnvironmental costs may negatively impact our financial condition.\nSolid waste landfilling has occurred on and around the property at CMS for many years. If damage to persons or property or contamination of the environment is determined to have been caused by the conduct of our business or by pollutants used, generated or disposed of by us, or which may be found on our property, we may be held liable for such damage and may be required to pay the cost of investigation or remediation, or both, of such contamination or damage. The amount of such liability, as to which we are self-insured, could be material. State and local laws relating to the protection of the environment also can include noise abatement laws that may be applicable to our racing events. Changes in federal, state or local laws, regulations or requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown conditions, could require additional significant expenditures by us for remediation and compliance.\nLand use laws and other governmental regulations may negatively impact our growth.\nOur development of new facilities, including the improvement or expansion of existing facilities, requires compliance with applicable federal, state and local land use, building codes and other planning, zoning and environmental regulations. Regulations governing the use and development of real estate may prevent us from acquiring or developing prime locations for motorsports facilities, substantially delay or complicate the process of improving existing facilities, or increase the costs of any such activities. Governmental laws and regulations may change or expand from time to time, resulting in increased costs for remediation or maintaining compliance.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by future exercises or future grants of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards or other stock-based compensation, sales of shares held by key personnel, or default of loans under which some of our common stock is pledged.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by the sale of approximately 307,000 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of various options under our equity compensation plans, by the issuance or sale of approximately 3,565,000 shares of our common stock available for grant under our equity compensation plans, or by the sale of approximately 29 million shares of our common stock available for resale in compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, including shares held directly or indirectly by Mr. O. Bruton Smith, our Executive Chairman, and Mr. Marcus G. Smith, our Chief Executive Officer. The market price for our common stock could also be adversely affected if there was a default of one of the non-Company loans under which 500,000 shares of our common stock, owned by Mr. O. Bruton Smith and Sonic Financial Corporation, an affiliate through common ownership by Mr. O. Bruton Smith and Mr. Marcus G. Smith, have been pledged.", "PERMNO": 81292, "SIC": 7948, "TIC": "TRK"}
