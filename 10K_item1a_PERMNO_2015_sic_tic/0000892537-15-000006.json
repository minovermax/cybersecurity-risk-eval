You should carefully consider the following risks together with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or those we currently deem to be immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualification and limitations of forward-looking statements set forth at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on contracts with the U.S. government for substantially all of our revenues. If our relationships with the U.S. government were harmed, our business, future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe derive the vast majority of our revenues from our U.S. government customers. We expect that U.S. government contracts will continue to be the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed if:\n\u2022\nWe are suspended or debarred from contracting with the U.S. government or a significant government agency;\n\u2022\nOur reputation or relationship with government agencies is impaired; or\n\u2022\nThe government ceases to do business with us, or significantly decreases the amount of business it does with us.\nAmong the key factors in maintaining our relationships with U.S. government agencies are our performance on individual contracts and task orders, the strength of our professional reputation and the relationships of our senior management with our customers.\nU.S. government spending levels for programs we support may change or be delayed in a manner that adversely affects our future results and limits our growth prospects.\nOur business depends upon continued U.S. government expenditures on intelligence, defense and other programs that we support. These expenditures have not remained constant over time. Over the last couple years, in the face of growing national debt and long-term fiscal challenges facing the nation, spending levels for U.S. government programs generally, and in particular the U.S. defense budget, have come under pressure. Federal budget constraints may affect future levels or timing of expenditures, place pressure on operating margins in our industry, and shift expenditures to programs in areas where we do not currently provide services, thereby adversely impacting our future results of operations. A reduction in the amount of services that we are contracted to provide, or incorporation of less favorable terms in existing or future contracts, could cause an adverse impact on our business and future results of operations.\nThe failure by Congress to approve budgets on a timely basis for the federal agencies we support could delay procurement of our services and solutions and cause us to lose future revenues.\nOn an annual basis, Congress must approve budgets that govern spending by the federal agencies that we support. In years when Congress is not able to complete its budget process before the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year on September 30, Congress typically funds government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution allows U.S. government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, it may delay funding we expect to receive from customers on work we are already performing and will likely result in new initiatives being delayed or in some cases cancelled. The U.S. government's failure to complete its budget process, or to fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution, may result in a U.S. government shutdown, such as that which occurred during the 2013 fiscal year.\nWe derive most of our revenues from contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes, and our revenue and profitability may be adversely impacted if we fail to compete effectively in such processes, or if there are delays as a result of our competitors' protests of contract awards that we receive.\nWe derive a significant portion of revenues from U.S. government contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process. We do not anticipate that this will change in the foreseeable future. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. The competitive bidding process involves risk and significant costs to businesses operating in this environment including:\n\u2022\nSpending substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, which may result in reduced profitability;\n\u2022\nExpending resources and making financial commitments (such as procuring leased premises) and bidding on programs in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen difficulties in execution, cost overruns, or, in the case of unsuccessful competition, the loss of committed costs.\n\u2022\nIncurring expense and delays due to protests or challenges of contract awards made to us from unsuccessful bidders, including the risk that any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract, which may result in reduced profitability;\n\u2022\nChanges in policy and goals by the government providing set-aside funds to small business, disadvantaged businesses and other socio-economic requirements in the allocation of contracts; and\n\u2022\nFailing to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we are awarded.\nAdditionally, many of our customers have increasingly focused on cost as a key component of the procurement evaluation process. This focus has increased competitive pricing pressures and resulted in a reduction to the profits we expect to earn on our U.S. government contracts. Specifically, the use by the U.S. government of a lowest price/technically acceptable standard for contract awards, may require us to decrease the margin by which we expect our bid price to exceed our costs.\nIf we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process, in addition to the risk that our operating results may be adversely affected, we may be unable to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for a number of years.\nWe face aggressive competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts, and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and generally encounter intense competition to win contracts, which are usually subject to competitive bidding processes. We may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts at historic levels. We compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition, financial resources and larger technical staffs than we have. We also compete with smaller, more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas. To remain competitive, we must provide superior service and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers. Our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or better contract terms than we can provide, including technical qualifications, past contract experience, geographic presence, price and the availability of qualified professional personnel. In particular, increased efforts by our competitors to meet U.S. government requirements for efficiency and cost reduction may necessitate that we become more competitive with respect to price, and thereby potentially reduce our profit margins, in order to win or maintain contracts. In addition, our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers' needs.\nOur earnings and profitability may be adversely affected if we do not accurately estimate the expenses, time and resources necessary to satisfy some of our contractual obligations.\nWe enter into three types of U.S. government contracts for our services: cost-reimbursable, time-and-materials and fixed-price. Our customers have increasingly procured our services under cost-reimbursable contracts, which tend to offer lower margin opportunities than other contract types. For our last three fiscal years, we derived revenues from such contracts as follows:\nEach of these types of contracts, to varying degrees, involves some risk that we could underestimate our cost of fulfilling the contract, which may reduce the profit we earn or lead to a financial loss on the contract.\n\u2022\nUnder cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance-based. To the extent that the actual costs incurred in performing a cost-reimbursable contract are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract and applicable regulations, we are entitled to reimbursement of our costs, plus a profit. However, if our costs exceed the ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to recover those costs. In particular, there is increasing focus by the U.S. government on the extent to which contractors are able to receive reimbursement for employee compensation.\n\u2022\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks for a fixed price. Compared to cost-plus contracts, fixed-price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities, but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns, which could result in increased costs and expenses. Because we assume such risk, an increase in the percentage of fixed-price contracts in our contract mix, whether caused by a shift by the U.S. government toward a preference for fixed-price contracts or otherwise, could increase the risk that we suffer losses if we underestimate the level of effort required to perform the contractual obligations.\n\u2022\nUnder time-and-material contracts, we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. We assume financial risk on time-and-material contracts because we assume the risk of performing those contracts at negotiated hourly rates.\nOur profits could be adversely affected if our costs under any of these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract.\nMany of our U.S. government customers execute their procurement budgets through multiple award contracts under which we are required to compete for post-award orders, or for which we may not be eligible to compete, potentially limiting our ability to win new contracts and increase revenues.\nBudgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. government customers to purchase goods and services through multiple award ID/IQ contracts and other multiple award and/or government wide acquisition contract vehicles. These contract vehicles require that we make sustained post-award efforts to obtain task orders under the relevant contract. There can be no assurance that we will obtain revenues or otherwise sell successfully under these contract vehicles. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment could harm our operating results.\nU.S. government contracts contain provisions giving government customers a variety of rights that are unfavorable to us, including the ability to terminate a contract at any time for convenience.\nU.S. government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These provisions may allow the government to:\n\u2022\nTerminate existing contracts for convenience, as well as for default;\n\u2022\nReduce orders under, or otherwise modify contracts or subcontracts;\n\u2022\nCancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u2022\nDecline to exercise an option to renew multi-year contracts or issue task orders in connection with multiple award contracts;\n\u2022\nSuspend or debar us from doing business with the U.S. government or with a government agency;\n\u2022\nProhibit future procurement awards with a particular agency as a result of a finding of an organizational conflict of interest based upon prior related work performed for the agency that would give a contractor an unfair advantage over competing contractors;\n\u2022\nSubject the award of contracts to protest by competitors, which may require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest and may also result in a requirement to resubmit offers for the contract or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract;\n\u2022\nTerminate our facility security clearances and thereby prevent us from receiving classified contracts;\n\u2022\nClaim rights in products and systems produced by us; and\n\u2022\nControl or prohibit the export of our products and services.\nIf the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may not even recover those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. If one of our government customers were to unexpectedly terminate, cancel or decline to exercise an option to renew one or more of our significant contracts or programs, our revenues and operating results would be materially harmed.\nWe may not realize as revenue the full value of our backlog, which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our backlog was $3.3 billion, of which $0.8 billion was funded. Backlog is our estimate of the remaining future revenues from existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to such contracts and including executed task orders issued under ID/IQ contracts. Backlog also includes estimates of revenues for solutions that we believe we will be asked to provide in the future under the terms of ID/IQ contracts for which we have an established pattern of revenues. Our estimates are based on our experience using such vehicles and similar contracts. However, due to the U.S. government's ability to not exercise contract options, and to terminate or modify our programs and their associated contracts, we cannot assure that all, or any, of such estimated contract revenues will be recognized. Furthermore, the actual receipt of revenue from contracts included in backlog may never occur or may be delayed because: a program schedule could change or the program could be cancelled; or a contract's funding or scope could be reduced, modified, delayed or terminated early, including as a result of a lack of appropriated funds or as a result of cost cutting initiatives and other efforts to reduce U.S. government spending. Our unfunded backlog, in particular, contains management's estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues. If we fail to realize as revenues those amounts included in our backlog, our future revenues and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution or other adverse consequences to our business.\nOne of our key operating strategies is to selectively pursue acquisitions. Our acquisitions strategy poses many risks, including:\n\u2022\nAs a result of an acquisition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings;\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulty retaining an acquired company's key employees or customers;\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen difficulties, such as incompatible accounting, information management or other control systems; and\n\u2022\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business or distract our management from other responsibilities.\nIn connection with any acquisition that we make, there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess. Acquired entities may not operate profitably or result in improved operating performance. Additionally, we may not realize anticipated synergies. If our acquisitions perform poorly, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents a significant asset on our balance sheet, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our goodwill was $851.6 million. The amount of our recorded goodwill may substantially increase in the future as a result of any acquisitions that we make. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. Impairment analysis is based on several factors requiring judgment and the use of estimates, which are inherently uncertain and based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, material changes in our financial outlook, as well as events outside of our control, such as deteriorating market conditions for companies in our industry, may indicate a potential impairment. When there is an impairment, we are required to write down the recorded amount of goodwill, which is reflected as a charge against operating income. We recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIf we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our U.S. government customers. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs. Non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. Among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are the following:\n\u2022\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation, which comprehensively regulates the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nThe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022\nThe Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nLaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data;\n\u2022\nU.S. export controls, which apply when we engage in international work; and\n\u2022\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.\nOur contracting agency customers periodically review our compliance with procurement laws and regulations, as well as our performance under the terms of our U.S. government contracts. If a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including the termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, the triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, fines and the suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies.\nAdditionally, the civil False Claims Act provides for potentially substantial civil penalties where, for example, a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the government or by other persons on behalf of the government (who may then share a portion of any recovery).\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may also suffer harm to our reputation, which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts. If we are subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation, our current business, future prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.\nUnfavorable U.S. government audits or results of other investigations could subject us to penalties or sanctions, adversely affect our profitability, harm our reputation and relationships with our customers or impair our ability to win new contracts.\nThe Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and other government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contracts and contractor systems. These agencies review a contractor's performance on its contract, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor's compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Allegations of impropriety or deficient controls could harm our reputation or influence the award of new contracts. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. In recent years, U.S. government contractors have faced increased scrutiny by the DCAA and other U.S. government agencies. For example, among other matters, the DCAA has begun to focus on the strict adherence by technology support contractors to labor qualification requirements contained in the terms of U.S. government contracts that we support. If any of our internal control systems or policies is found non-compliant or inadequate, payments may be withheld or suspended under our contracts or we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval requirements that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on our contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government. As a result, a DCAA audit could materially affect our competitive position and result in a substantial adjustment to our revenues and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors, or the failure of contractors with whom we have entered into a subcontract or prime contract relationship to meet their contractual obligations to us or our clients, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a prime contractor, we often rely on other companies to perform some of the work under a contract, and we expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for portions of our delivery of services and revenue in the foreseeable future. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, client concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, or our hiring of a subcontractor\u2019s personnel. In addition, if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized. Material losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a client terminating a contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we derived 11% and 9% of our revenues, respectively, from contracts in which we acted as a subcontractor to other contractors. As a subcontractor, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract. Poor performance on such contracts could impact our reputation, even if we perform as required. In addition, as a subcontractor, we may be unable to collect payments owed to us by the prime contractor, even if we have performed our obligations under the contract, as a result of, among other things, the prime contractor\u2019s inability to fulfill the contract.\nAdditionally, we occasionally enter into joint ventures so that we can jointly bid and perform on a particular project. The success of these and other joint ventures depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations by our joint venture partners. If our partners do not meet their obligations, the joint ventures may be unable to adequately perform and deliver their contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture, which could also affect our reputation in the industries we serve.\nInternal system or service failures, including those resulting from cyber or other security threats, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our customers, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe create, implement and maintain information technology and engineering systems, and provide services that are often critical to our customers' operations, some of which involve classified or other sensitive information in intelligence, national security and other classified or sensitive customer functions. As a result, we are subject to systems or service failures, not only resulting from our own failures or the failures of third-party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, but also from continuous exposure to cyber and other security threats, including computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or physical break-ins. In particular, as a U.S. government contractor, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to classified or other sensitive information resulting from disclosure of classified operations, an attack by computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists. Many government contractors have been the target of these types of attacks in the past and future attacks are likely to occur. If successful, these types of attacks on our network or other systems or service failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of customer or proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our customers' businesses and damage to our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our systems, communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf our systems, services or other applications have significant defects or errors, are successfully attacked by cyber and other security threats, suffer delivery delays or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we may:\n\u2022\nlose revenue due to adverse customer reaction;\n\u2022\nbe required to provide additional services to a customer at no charge;\n\u2022\nincur additional costs related to monitoring and increasing our cyber security;\n\u2022\nlose revenue due to the deployment of internal staff for remediation efforts instead of customer assignments;\n\u2022\nreceive negative publicity, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers;\n\u2022\nbe unable to successfully market services that are reliant on the creation and maintenance of secure information technology systems to U.S. government, international and commercial customers;\n\u2022\nsuffer claims for substantial damages, particularly as a result of any successful network or systems breach and exfiltration of customer information; or\n\u2022\nincur significant costs complying with applicable federal or state law, including laws governing protection of personal information.\nIn addition to any costs resulting from contract performance or required corrective action, these failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenues if they result in customers postponing subsequently scheduled work or canceling or failing to renew contracts.\nOur errors and omissions insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to some types of future claims. The successful assertion of any large claim against us could seriously harm our business. Even if not successful, these claims could result in significant legal and other costs, may be a distraction to our management and may harm our customer relationships.\nSecurity breaches in customer systems could adversely affect our business.\nMany of the programs we support and systems we develop, install and maintain involve managing and protecting information involved in intelligence, national security and other classified or sensitive customer functions. While we have programs designed to comply with relevant security laws, regulations and restrictions, a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation and prevent us from being eligible for further work on critical systems for our current customers or for other U.S. government customers generally. Losses that we could incur from such a security breach could exceed the policy limits that we have for errors and omissions and product liability insurance coverage. Damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of the systems we develop, install and maintain could materially reduce our revenues.\nIf we fail to recruit and retain skilled employees or employees with the necessary skill sets or security clearances, we might not be able to perform under our contracts or win new business and our growth may be limited.\nTo be competitive, we must have employees who have advanced information technology and technical services skills and who work well with our customers in a government or defense-related environment. Often, these employees must have some of the highest security clearances in the United States. These employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future. Recruiting, training and retention costs can place significant demands on our resources. If we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees, our ability to maintain and grow our business could be negatively impacted. If we are required to engage larger numbers of contracted personnel, our profit margins could be adversely affected. In addition, some of our contracts contain provisions requiring us to commit to staff a program with certain personnel the customer considers key to our successful performance under the contract. In the event we are unable to provide these key personnel or acceptable substitutions, the customer may terminate the contract and we may not be able to recover certain incurred costs.\nOur business depends upon obtaining and maintaining required security clearances.\nMany of our U.S. government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances complying with the Department of Defense and intelligence community requirements. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process and it is difficult to identify, recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If our employees are unable to obtain or retain security clearances or if our employees who hold security clearances terminate employment with us, the customer whose work requires cleared employees could terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration. In addition, we expect that many of the contracts on which we will bid will require us to demonstrate our ability to obtain facility security clearances and perform work with employees who hold specified types of security clearances. To the extent we are not able to obtain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract, we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts, or effectively re-bid on expiring contracts.\nCovenants in the instruments governing our revolving credit facility may restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe maintain a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The credit agreement provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility. The maturity date for the credit agreement is June 13, 2019. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with specified financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain consolidated total leverage ratios and a certain fixed charge coverage ratio, and contains negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or impose restriction on the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, make acquisitions and undertake certain other actions.\nAdditionally, any event of default under the Credit Agreement, could have a material adverse effect on our business if the creditors determine to exercise their rights.\nOur overall profit margins on our contracts may decrease and our results of operations could be adversely affected if materials and subcontract revenues grow at a faster rate than labor-related revenues.\nOur revenues are generated both from the efforts of our employees (labor-related revenues) and from the receipt of payments for the cost of materials and subcontracts we use in connection with performing our services (materials and subcontract revenues). Generally, our materials and subcontract revenues have lower profit margins than our labor-related revenues. If our materials and subcontract revenues grow at a faster rate than labor-related revenues, our overall profit margins may decrease and our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur business operations involve considerable risks and hazards. An accident or incident involving our employees or third parties could harm our reputation, affect our ability to compete for business, and if not adequately insured or indemnified, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business involves providing services that require some of our employees to operate in countries that may be experiencing political unrest, war or terrorism. As a result, during the course of such deployments we are exposed to liabilities arising from accidents or incidents involving our employees or third parties. Any of these types of accidents or incidents could involve significant potential injury or other claims by employees and/or third parties. It is also possible that we will encounter unexpected costs in connection with additional risks inherent in sending our employees to dangerous locations, such as increased insurance costs, as well as the repatriation of our employees or executives for reasons beyond our control.\nWe maintain insurance policies that mitigate risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. Substantial claims in excess of our related insurance coverage could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenues.\nFurthermore, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, may result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our reputation among our customers and the public, which could result in us losing existing and future contracts or make it more difficult to compete effectively for future contracts. This could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenues.\nOur employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could cause us to lose customers or affect our ability to contract with the U.S. government.\nBecause we are a government contractor, should an employee or subcontractor commit fraud or should other misconduct occur, such occurrences could have an adverse impact on our business and reputation. Misconduct by employees, subcontractors or joint venture partners could involve intentional failures to comply with federal laws including: U.S. government procurement regulations; requirements for handling of sensitive or classified information; the terms of our contracts; or proper time-keeping practices. These actions could lead to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties (including fines, imprisonment, suspension and/or debarment from performing U.S. government contracts) and harm our reputation. The precautions we take to prevent and detect such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses.\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nOur business operations are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in or interpretations of foreign laws or policies that may adversely affect the performance of our services;\n\u2022\nPolitical instability in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nImposition of inconsistent laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nConducting business in places where laws, business practices and customs are unfamiliar or unknown;\n\u2022\nImposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures; and\n\u2022\nCompliance with a variety of U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. export control regulations, by us or subcontractors.\nAlthough such risks have not significantly impacted our business to date, we do not know the impact that these regulatory, geopolitical and other factors could have on our business in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may be of limited significance in some cases, and as such, you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. While our financial results may be negatively affected by any of the risk factors identified in this section of our Form 10-K, a number of factors could cause our revenues, cash flows and operating results to vary from quarter-to-quarter, including:\n\u2022\nTiming of award or performance incentive fee notices;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in revenues earned on fixed-price contracts and contracts with a performance-based fee structure;\n\u2022\nCommencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u2022\nReallocation of funds to customers due to priority;\n\u2022\nTiming of significant bid and proposal costs;\n\u2022\nVariable purchasing patterns under government contracts, blanket purchase agreements and ID/IQ contracts;\n\u2022\nSeasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our workdays and staff utilization rates;\n\u2022\nStrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs and joint ventures;\n\u2022\nChanges in Presidential administrations and senior U.S. government officials that affect the timing of technology procurement;\n\u2022\nChanges in U.S. government policy or budgetary measures that adversely affect government contracts in general; and\n\u2022\nChanges in the volume of purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials.\nBecause a relatively large amount of our expenses are fixed, cash flows from our operations may vary significantly as a result of changes in the volume of services provided under existing contracts and the number of contracts that are commenced, completed or terminated during any quarter. We incur significant operating expenses during the start-up and early stages of large contracts and typically we do not receive corresponding payments in that same quarter. We may also incur significant or unanticipated expenses when a contract expires, terminates or is not renewed.\nWe may change our dividend policy in the future.\nThe Company has maintained a regular cash dividend program since 2011. We anticipate paying quarterly dividends for 2015 pursuant to such program. However, any future payment of dividends, including the timing and amount of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, liquidity, financial condition and such other factors as our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nMr. Pedersen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effectively controls our Company, and his interests may not be aligned with those of other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Mr. Pedersen owned approximately 35% of our total outstanding shares of common stock. Holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share, while holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to only one vote per share. Mr. Pedersen beneficially owned 13,192,845 shares of Class B common stock as of December 31, 2014, thus he controlled approximately 85% of the combined voting power of our stock as of December 31, 2014. Accordingly, Mr. Pedersen controls the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As long as Mr. Pedersen beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, he will have the ability, without the consent of our public stockholders, to elect all members of our Board of Directors and to control our management and affairs.\nMr. Pedersen's voting control may have the effect of preventing or discouraging transactions involving an actual or a potential change of control of the Company, regardless of whether a premium is offered over then-current market prices. Mr. Pedersen will be able to cause a change of control of the Company. Mr. Pedersen's voting control could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock if investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company with such concentrated ownership.\nMr. Pedersen could also cause a registration statement to be filed and to become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, thereby permitting him to freely sell or transfer the shares of common stock that he owns, which could have an impact on the trading price of our stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids that you and other stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our Company, even if a change of control were considered favorable by you and other stockholders. Among the provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, are provisions relating to the following:\n\u2022\nThe high vote nature of our Class B common stock;\n\u2022\nThe ability of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\nThe inability of stockholders to take action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nThe advance notice requirements for director nominations or other proposals submitted by our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 89307, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "MANT"}
