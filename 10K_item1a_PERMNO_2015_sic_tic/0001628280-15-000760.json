{"cik": "1364885", "company": "Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves risk and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties set forth below are those that we currently believe may materially and adversely affect us, our future business or results of operations, or investments in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us, our future business or results of operations or investments in our securities.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur commercial business is cyclical and sensitive to commercial airlines' profitability. The business of commercial airlines is, in turn, affected by global economic conditions and geo-political considerations.\nWe compete in the aerostructures segment of the aerospace industry. Our customers' business, and therefore our own, is directly affected by the financial condition of commercial airlines and other economic factors, including global economic conditions and geo-political considerations that affect the demand for air transportation. Specifically, our commercial business is dependent on the demand from passenger airlines and cargo carriers for the production of new aircraft. Accordingly, demand for our commercial products is tied to the worldwide airline industry's ability to finance the purchase of new aircraft and the industry's forecasted demand for seats, flights, routes and cargo capacity. Similarly, the size and age of the worldwide commercial aircraft fleet affects the demand for new aircraft and, consequently, for our products. Such factors, in conjunction with evolving economic conditions, cause the market in which we operate to be cyclical to varying degrees, thereby affecting our business and operating results.\nThe commercial airline industry is impacted by the strength of the global economy and the geopolitical events around the world. Possible exogenous shocks such as expanding conflicts or political unrest in the Middle East or Asia, renewed terrorist attacks against the industry, or pandemic health crises have the potential to cause precipitous declines in air traffic. Any protracted economic slump, adverse credit market conditions, future terrorist attacks, war or health concerns could cause airlines to cancel or delay the purchase of additional new aircraft which could result in a deterioration of commercial airplane backlogs. If demand for new aircraft decreases, there would likely be a decrease in demand for our commercial aircraft products, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft accident.\nOur operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced by us or our suppliers. While we believe that our liability insurance coverage is sufficient to protect us in the event of future product liability claims, it may not be adequate. Also, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any such liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to make payments on such liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn accident caused by one of our components could also damage our reputation for quality products. We believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aerostructures. If an accident were to be caused by one of our components, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by product warranty obligations.\nOur operations expose us to potential liability for warranty claims made by customers or third parties with respect to aircraft components that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. Material product warranty obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we depend on Boeing and, to a lesser extent, Airbus, as our largest customers, our sales, cash flows from operations and results of operations will be negatively affected if either Boeing or Airbus reduces the number of products it purchases from us or if either experiences business difficulties.\nCurrently, Boeing is our largest customer and Airbus is our second-largest customer. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, approximately 83% and 10% of our net revenues were generated from sales to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. Although our strategy, in part, is to diversify our customer base by entering into supply arrangements with additional customers, we cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in doing so. Even if we are successful in obtaining and retaining new customers, we expect that Boeing and, to a lesser extent, Airbus, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. Although we are a party to various supply contracts with Boeing and Airbus which obligate Boeing and Airbus to purchase all of their requirements for certain products from us, those agreements generally do not require specific minimum purchase volumes. In addition, if we breach certain obligations under these supply agreements and Boeing or Airbus exercises its right to terminate such agreements, our business will be materially adversely affected. Further, if we are unable to perform our obligations under these supply agreements to the customer's satisfaction, Boeing or Airbus could seek damages from us, which could materially adversely affect our business. Boeing and Airbus also have the contractual right to cancel their supply agreements with us for convenience, which could include the termination of one or more aircraft models or programs for which we supply products. Although Boeing and Airbus would be required to reimburse us for certain expenses, there can be no assurance these payments would adequately cover our expenses or lost profits resulting from the termination. In addition, we have agreed to a limitation on recoverable damages if Boeing wrongfully terminates our main supply agreement with respect to any model or program. If this occurs, we may not be able to recover the full amount of our actual damages. Furthermore, if Boeing or Airbus (1) experiences a decrease in requirements for the products which we supply to it; (2) experiences a major disruption in its business, such as a strike, work stoppage or slowdown, a supply-chain problem or a decrease in orders from its customers; or (3) files for bankruptcy protection; our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur largest customer, Boeing, operates in a very competitive business environment.\nBoeing operates in a highly competitive industry. Competition from Airbus, Boeing's main competitor, as well as from regional jet makers and other foreign manufacturers of commercial single-aisle aircraft, has intensified as these competitors expand aircraft model offerings and competitively price their products. As a result of this competitive environment, Boeing continues to face pressure on product offerings and sale prices. While we do have supply agreements with Airbus, we currently have substantially more business with Boeing and thus any adverse effect on Boeing's production of aircraft resulting from this competitive environment may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends, in large part, on sales of components for a single aircraft program, the B737.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, approximately 45% of our net revenues were generated from sales of components to Boeing for the B737 aircraft. While we have entered into long-term supply agreements with Boeing to continue to provide components for the B737 for the life of the aircraft program, including commercial and the military P-8 derivatives, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any replacement for the B737 that is not a commercial derivative model. If we were unable to obtain significant aerostructures supply business for any B737 replacement program, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends, in part, on securing work for replacement programs.\nWhile we have entered into long-term supply agreements with Boeing to provide components for the B737, B747, B767 and B777 and their commercial derivatives for the life of these aircraft programs, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any subsequent variant of these aircraft that is not a commercial derivative as defined by the Supply Agreement. Boeing has publicly announced its intention to update the B777 with a next-generation twin-engine aircraft program currently named the Boeing 777X. If the changes to the aircraft are later deemed significant enough to disqualify it as a commercial derivative of the B777 under the Supply Agreement, or Boeing successfully establishes it is not capable of being FAA certificated by amendment to an existing Type Certification through addition of a new minor model or by a Supplemental Type Certificate, there is a risk that we may not be engaged by Boeing on the 777X to generally the same extent of Spirit\u2019s involvement in the B777, or at all. If we are unable to obtain significant aerostructures supply business for any update or replacement program for the B777 or any other aircraft program for which we provide significant content, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be required to repay Boeing up to approximately $581.1 million of advance payments related to the B787 Supply Agreement. The advances must be repaid in the event that Boeing does not take delivery of a sufficient number of shipsets prior to the termination of the aircraft program.\nBoeing has made advance payments to Spirit under the B787 Supply Agreement, which advance payments are required to be repaid to Boeing by way of offset against the purchase price for future shipset deliveries. Advance repayments are scheduled to be spread evenly over the remainder of the first 1,000 B787 shipsets delivered to Boeing, except that advance repayments have been suspended for the 12-month period beginning April 1, 2014, and any repayments that otherwise would have become due during such 12-month period will be made by offset against the purchase price for shipset 1,001 and beyond.\nIn the event Boeing does not take delivery of a sufficient number of shipsets to repay the full amount of advances prior to the termination of the B787 program or the B787 Supply Agreement, any advances not then repaid will be applied against any outstanding payments then due by Boeing to us, and any remaining balance will be repaid in annual installments of $42.0 million on December 15th of each year until the advance payments have been fully recovered by Boeing.\nAccordingly, portions of the advance repayment liability are included as current and long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of advance payments and deferred revenue received by us from Boeing under the B787 Supply Agreement and not yet repaid or recognized as revenue was approximately $581.1 million.\nWe may be required to repay Airbus up to approximately $224.3 million of advance payments. The advances must be repaid in the event that Airbus does not take delivery of a sufficient number of shipsets prior to the date set out in the advance agreement.\nIn February 2012, Spirit and Airbus entered into an agreement whereby Spirit received a series of payments totaling $250.0 million, which were recorded as advance payments within our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe agreement provides for repayment of the $250.0 million in cash advances made by Airbus to be offset against the purchase price of the first 200 Section 15 A350 XWB shipsets delivered to Airbus prior to December 31, 2017. If in the course of 2015, Airbus, in its reasonable opinion, anticipates 200 units will not be ordered and paid for by the end of 2017, both Airbus and Spirit will agree in the first quarter of 2016 on a revised repayment amount to ensure the entire advance is repaid prior to December 31, 2017. In no circumstance would the repayment amount exceed the recurring price of each shipset.\nPortions of the advance repayment liability are included as current and long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of advance payments received by us from Airbus under the advance agreement and not yet repaid or recognized as revenue was approximately $224.3 million.\nThe profitability of certain of our new and maturing programs depends significantly on the assumptions surrounding satisfactory settlement of claims and assertions.\nFor certain of our new and maturing programs, we regularly commence work or incorporate customer requested changes prior to negotiating pricing terms for engineering work or the product which has been modified. We typically have the legal right to\nnegotiate pricing for customer directed changes. In those cases, we assert to our customers our contractual rights to obtain the additional revenue or cost reimbursement we expect to receive upon finalizing pricing terms. An expected recovery value of these assertions is incorporated into our contract profitability estimates when applying contract accounting. Our inability to recover these expected values, among other factors, could result in the recognition of a forward loss on these programs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face risks as we work to successfully execute on new or maturing programs.\nNew or maturing programs with new technologies typically carry risks associated with design responsibility, development of new production tools, hiring and training of qualified personnel, increased capital and funding commitments, ability to meet customer specifications, delivery schedules and unique contractual requirements, supplier performance, ability of the customer to meet its contractual obligations to us, and our ability to accurately estimate costs associated with such programs. In addition, any new or maturing aircraft program may not generate sufficient demand or may experience technological problems or significant delays in the regulatory certification or manufacturing and delivery schedule. If we were unable to perform our obligations under new or maturing programs to the customer's satisfaction or manufacture products at our estimated costs, if we were to experience unexpected fluctuations in raw material prices or supplier problems leading to cost overruns, if we were unable to successfully perform under revised design and manufacturing plans or successfully resolve claims and assertions, or if a new or maturing program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, delays or technological problems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Some of these risks have affected our maturing programs to the extent that we have recorded significant forward losses and maintain certain of our maturing programs at zero or low margins due to our inability to overcome the effects of these risks. We continue to face similar risks as well as the potential for default, quality problems, or inability to meet weight requirements and these could result in continued zero or low margins or additional forward losses, and the risk of having to write-off additional inventory if it were deemed to be unrecoverable over the life of the program. In addition, beginning new work on existing programs also carries risks associated with the transfer of technology, knowledge and tooling.\nIn order to perform on new or maturing programs we may be required to construct or acquire new facilities requiring additional up-front investment costs. In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear certain unrecoverable construction and maintenance costs and incur potential impairment charges for the new facilities. Also, we may need to expend additional resources to determine an alternate revenue-generating use for the facilities. Likewise, significant delays in the construction or acquisition of a plant site could impact production schedules.\nWe use estimates in accounting for revenue and cost for our contract blocks. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and estimates revenue and cost for contract blocks that span a period of multiple years. The contract method of accounting requires judgment on a number of underlying assumptions to develop our estimates. Due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams are generated, the variability of future period estimated revenue and cost may be adversely affected if circumstances or underlying assumptions change. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing revenue and profit, please see our discussion under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, variability of future period estimated revenue and cost may result in recording additional valuation allowances against future deferred tax assets, which could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nOur operations depend on our ability to maintain continuing, uninterrupted production at our manufacturing facilities. Our production facilities are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.\nOur manufacturing facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war, terrorist activity or sustained mechanical failure. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe, such as a fire, flood, tornado or other natural disaster at any of our sites, war or terrorist activities in any of the areas where we conduct operations or the sustained mechanical failure of a key piece of equipment could result in a prolonged interruption of all or a substantial portion of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers and we may not have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events. A large portion of our operations takes place at one facility in Wichita, Kansas and any significant damage or disruption to this facility in particular would materially adversely affect our ability to service our customers.\nWe recently divested a portion of our Tulsa site, which could disrupt our business and present risks not contemplated at the time of the divestiture.\nAs previously announced, in December 2014 we divested our Gulfstream G280 and G650 wing programs, which we produced at our Tulsa facility, to a subsidiary of Triumph Group, Inc. We continue to produce work on other programs, including the B787\nwing program, at this facility, and prior to the divestiture, we utilized certain resources for both the programs we sold and the programs we retained. In addition, as part of the divestiture, we have obligations to provide transition services to the buyer. As a result, our business is subject to certain potential risks relating to the divestiture, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of resources from the operation of the retained business in order to provide transition services to the buyer;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our existing customer, supplier and other business relationships.\nFurthermore, we actively consider other divestitures from time to time. If we decide to pursue any other divestiture, it may involve numerous potential risks, including those described above and the following:\n\u2022\ndiversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business;\n\u2022\nnegative effects on our reported results of operations from disposition-related charges, amortization expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets;\n\u2022\nthe need to agree to retain or assume certain current or future liabilities in order to complete the divestiture; and\n\u2022\nthe expenditure of substantial legal and other fees, which may be incurred whether or not a transaction is consummated\nAs a result of the aforementioned risks, among others, the pursuit of any divestiture may not lead to increased stockholder value.\nFuture commitments to our customers to increase production rates depend on our ability to expand production at our manufacturing facilities.\nBoeing and Airbus, our two largest customers, have both announced planned production rate increases for several of their major programs. In some cases, in order to meet these increases in production rates, we will need to make significant capital expenditures to expand our capacity and improve our performance or find alternative solutions such as outsourcing some of our existing work to free up additional capacity. While some of these expenditures will be reimbursed by our customers, we could be required to bear a significant portion of the costs. In addition, the increases in production rates could cause disruptions in our manufacturing lines, which could materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments to our customers, and have a resulting adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a very competitive business environment.\nCompetition in the aerostructures segment of the aerospace industry is intense. Although we have entered into supply agreements with Boeing and Airbus under which we are their exclusive supplier for certain aircraft parts, we will face substantial competition from both OEMs and non-OEM aerostructures suppliers in trying to expand our customer base and the types of parts we make.\nOEMs may choose not to outsource production of aerostructures due to, among other things, their own direct labor and other overhead considerations and capacity utilization at their own facilities. Consequently, traditional factors affecting competition, such as price and quality of service, may not be significant determinants when OEMs decide whether to produce a part in-house or to outsource.\nOur principal competitors among non-OEM aerostructures suppliers are Aernnova Aircelle S.A., Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., GKN Aerospace, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nordam, Sonaca, Triumph Group, Inc., Latecoere S.A., and Nexcelle. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do and, therefore, may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. Providers of aerostructures have traditionally competed on the basis of cost, technology, quality and service. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment in product development, engineering, supply-chain management and sales and marketing, and we may not have enough resources to make such investments. For these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully in this market or against our competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigh switching costs may substantially limit our ability to obtain business that is currently under contract with other suppliers.\nOnce a contract is awarded by an OEM to an aerostructures supplier, the OEM and the supplier are typically required to spend significant amounts of time and capital on design, manufacture, testing and certification of tooling and other equipment. For an OEM to change suppliers during the life of an aircraft program, further testing and certification would be necessary, and the OEM would be required either to move the tooling and equipment used by the existing supplier for performance under the existing\ncontract, which may be expensive and difficult (or impossible), or to manufacture new tooling and equipment. Accordingly, any change of suppliers would likely result in production delays and additional costs to both the OEM and the new supplier. These high switching costs may make it more difficult for us to bid competitively against existing suppliers and less likely that an OEM will be willing to switch suppliers during the life of an aircraft program, which could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain new work on existing aircraft programs.\nIncreases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur financial performance is affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. A majority of our workforce is represented by unions. If our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could cause us to be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis and could result in a breach of our supply agreements. This could result in a loss of business and an increase in our operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our non-unionized labor force may become subject to labor union organizing efforts, which could cause us to incur additional labor costs and increase the related risks that we now face.\nWe have agreed with Boeing to continue to operate substantial manufacturing operations in Wichita, Kansas until at least June 16, 2015 and we have other commitments to keep major programs in Wichita until 2020 in certain circumstances. This may prevent us from being able to offer our products at prices that are competitive in the marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate new business.\nIn addition, many aircraft manufacturers, airlines and aerospace suppliers have unionized work forces. Any strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by aircraft manufacturers, airlines or aerospace suppliers could reduce our customers' demand for additional aircraft structures or prevent us from completing production of our aircraft structures.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected if we lose our government, regulatory or industry approvals, if more stringent government regulations are enacted, or if industry oversight is increased.\nThe FAA prescribes standards and qualification requirements for aerostructures, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products, and licenses component repair stations within the United States. Comparable agencies, such as the JAA in Europe, regulate these matters in other countries. If we fail to qualify for or obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a qualification or license previously granted, the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be expensive and time consuming.\nFrom time to time, the FAA, the JAA or comparable agencies propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations. These changes or new regulations generally increase the costs of compliance. To the extent the FAA, the JAA or comparable agencies implement regulatory changes, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance.\nIn addition, certain aircraft repair activities we intend to engage in may require the approval of the aircraft's OEM. Our inability to obtain OEM approval could materially restrict our ability to perform such aircraft repair activities.\nOur business is subject to regulation in the United States and internationally.\nThe manufacturing of our products is subject to numerous federal, state and foreign governmental regulations. The number of laws and regulations that are being enacted or proposed by state, federal and international governments and authorities are increasing. Compliance with these regulations is difficult and expensive. If we fail to adhere, or are alleged to have failed to adhere, to any applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, or if such laws or regulations negatively affect sales of our products, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected by changes in applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, including those relating to manufacturing processes, product liability, trade rules and customs regulations, intellectual property, consumer laws, privacy laws, as well as accounting standards and taxation requirements (including tax-rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations).\nWe are subject to regulation of our technical data and goods under U.S. export control laws.\nAs a manufacturer and exporter of defense and dual-use technical data and commodities, we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations governing international trade and exports, including, but not limited to, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of State, and the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Collaborative agreements that we may have with foreign persons, including manufacturers and suppliers, are also\nsubject to U.S. export control laws. In addition, we are subject to trade sanctions against embargoed countries, administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nA determination that we have failed to comply with one or more of these export controls or trade sanctions could result in civil or criminal penalties, including the imposition of fines upon us as well as the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. Additionally, restrictions may be placed on the export of technical data and goods in the future as a result of changing geopolitical conditions. Any one or more of such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations and our ongoing operations may expose us to related liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties, including criminal sanctions, if we fail to comply with these requirements. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict with certainty what environmental legislation will be enacted in the future or how existing laws will be administered or interpreted. Our operations involve the use of large amounts of hazardous substances and regulated materials and generate many types of wastes, including emissions of hexavalent chromium and volatile organic compounds, and so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Spills and releases of these materials may subject us to clean-up liability for remediation and claims of alleged personal injury, property damage and damage to natural resources, and we may become obligated to reduce our emissions of hexavalent chromium, volatile organic compounds and/or greenhouse gases. We cannot give any assurance that the aggregate amount of future remediation costs and other environmental liabilities will not be material.\nBoeing, our predecessor at the Wichita facility, is under an administrative consent order issued by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment to contain and remediate contaminated groundwater, which underlies a majority of our Wichita facility. Pursuant to this order and its agreements with us, Boeing has a long-term remediation plan in place, and treatment, containment and remediation efforts are underway. If Boeing does not comply with its obligations under the order and these agreements, we may be required to undertake such efforts and make material expenditures.\nIn connection with the BAE Acquisition, we acquired a manufacturing facility in Prestwick, Scotland that is adjacent to contaminated property retained by BAE Systems. The contaminated property may be subject to a regulatory action requiring remediation of the land. It is also possible that the contamination may spread into the property we acquired. BAE Systems has agreed to indemnify us, subject to certain contractual limitations and conditions, for certain clean-up costs and other losses, liabilities, expenses and claims related to existing pollution on the acquired property, existing pollution that migrates from the acquired property to a third party's property and any pollution that migrates to our property from property retained by BAE Systems. If BAE Systems does not comply with its obligations under the BAE Acquisition agreement, we may be required to undertake such efforts and make material expenditures.\nIn the future, contamination may be discovered at or emanating from our facilities or at off-site locations where we send waste. The remediation of such newly discovered contamination, related claims for personal injury or damages, or the enactment of new laws or a stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require us to make additional expenditures, some of which could be material. See \"Business - Environmental Matters\".\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals have and will continue to force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex, and could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted annual investigation, disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that manufacture or contract to manufacture products that contain conflict minerals that originated from the DRC and adjoining countries. Our initial report required under these regulations was filed on June 2, 2014 (with respect to 2013). As a result of these requirements, we have and will continue to incur compliance costs, including costs related to determining the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in certain of our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict minerals from sources outside of the DRC or adjoining countries or that have been independently verified as not funding armed conflict in those countries, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain such verified minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all necessary conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement, or if we cannot satisfy any customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as \u201cconflict free.\u201d If we are not able to meet such customer\nrequirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold. We may face similar risks in connection with any other regulations focusing on social responsibility or ethical sourcing that may be adopted in the future.\nSignificant consolidation in the aerospace industry could make it difficult for us to obtain new business.\nSuppliers in the aerospace industry have consolidated and formed alliances to broaden their product and integrated system offerings and achieve critical mass. This supplier consolidation is in part attributable to aircraft manufacturers more frequently awarding long-term sole-source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers, thus reducing the total number of suppliers. If this consolidation were to continue, it may become more difficult for us to be successful in obtaining new customers.\nWe may be materially adversely affected by high fuel prices.\nDue to the competitive nature of the airline industry, airlines are often unable to pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares. Fluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it difficult to predict the future availability of jet fuel. In the event there is an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other conflicts, or significant disruptions in oil production or delivery in oil-producing areas or elsewhere, there could be reductions in the production or importation of crude oil and significant increases in the cost of fuel. If there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost, the airline industry and, as a result, our business, could be materially adversely affected.\nInterruptions in deliveries of components or raw materials, or increased prices for components or raw materials used in our products could delay production and/or materially adversely affect our financial performance, profitability, margins and revenues.\nWe are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials and purchased components from our suppliers, some of which are available only from a sole source or limited sources. Our dependency upon regular deliveries from particular suppliers of components and raw materials means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could materially adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers, to the extent alternate suppliers exist, could be made. If any of our suppliers were unable or were to refuse to deliver materials to us for an extended period of time, or if we were unable to negotiate acceptable terms for the supply of materials with these or alternative suppliers, our business could suffer.\nMoreover, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers to provide materials and components that meet specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules. Our suppliers' failure to provide expected raw materials or component parts that meet our technical specifications could adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs for us and possible forward losses on certain contracts. Even if acceptable alternatives are found, the process of locating and securing such alternatives might be disruptive to our business and might lead to termination of our supply agreements with our customers.\nOur continued supply of materials is subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022\nthe destruction of or damage to our suppliers' facilities or their distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\na work stoppage or strike by our suppliers' employees;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or in compliance with specifications;\n\u2022\nthe failure of essential equipment at our suppliers' plants;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to satisfy U.S. and international import and export control laws for goods that we purchase from such suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to meet regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nthe failure, shortage or delay in the delivery of raw materials to our suppliers;\n\u2022\ncontractual amendments and disputes with our suppliers; and\n\u2022\ninability of our suppliers to perform as a result of the weakened global economy or otherwise.\nIn addition, our profitability is affected by the prices of the components and raw materials, such as titanium, aluminum and carbon fiber, used in the manufacturing of our products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including world oil prices, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates and, in some cases, government regulation. Although our supply agreements with Boeing\nand Airbus allow us to pass on to our customers certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs in limited situations, we may not be fully compensated by the customers for the entirety of any such increased costs.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could harm our business.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, manufacturing and engineering positions. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified executives and engineers are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the aerospace industry, and in particular in Wichita, Kansas where the majority of our manufacturing and executive offices are located, can be intense. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and share-based compensation. Our share-based incentive awards consist primarily of restricted stock grants, some of which are conditioned on our achievement of certain designated financial performance targets, which makes the size of a particular year's award uncertain. If employees do not receive share-based incentive awards with a value they anticipate, if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting share-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. The failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (\"NISPOM\") for our Facility Security Clearance (\"FCL\"), which is a prerequisite for our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. Government.\nA Department of Defense (\"DOD\") FCL is required for a company to be awarded and perform on classified contracts for the DOD and certain other agencies of the U.S. Government. From time to time we have performed and may perform on classified contracts, although we did not generate any revenues from classified contracts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. We have obtained a FCL at the \"Secret\" level. If we were to violate the terms and requirements of the NISPOM or any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations, we could lose our FCL. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to maintain our FCL. If for some reason our FCL is invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform under our classified contracts in effect at that time, and we would not be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nWe derive a significant portion of our net revenues from direct and indirect sales outside the United States and are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales by Boeing and Airbus to customers outside the United States. In addition, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, direct sales to our non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 12% of our net revenues. We expect that our and our customers' international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives and consultants;\n\u2022\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs and embargos, export controls and other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws; and\n\u2022\neconomic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships and military and political alliances.\nWhile these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict, adverse developments in one or more of these areas could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOur fixed-price contracts and requirements to re-negotiate pricing at specified times may commit us to unfavorable terms.\nWe provide most of our products and services through long-term contracts in which the pricing terms are fixed based on certain production volumes. Accordingly, there is the risk that we will not be able to sustain a cost structure that is consistent with assumptions used in bidding on contracts. Increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit margins or cause us to sustain losses on these contracts. Other than certain increases in raw material costs which can be passed on to our customers, in most instances we must fully absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts and in projecting the ultimate level of sales that we may achieve. Our failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate delivery reductions, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed-price contract may reduce the profitability of a contract or cause a loss.\nThis risk particularly applies to products such as the Boeing B787, for which we had delivered two hundred eighty-two production articles as of December 31, 2014 since the inception of the program, and in respect of which our performance at the contracted price depends on our being able to achieve production cost reductions as we gain production experience (although Spirit can recoup from Boeing half of any overruns within a certain percentage of shipset prices). When we initially negotiated the B787-8 pricing, we assumed that a contractually mandated joint-effort by Boeing and Spirit to reduce costs and increase production efficiency, as well as favorable trends in volume, learning curve efficiencies and future pricing from suppliers would reduce our production costs over the life of the B787 program, thus maintaining or improving the margin on each B787 we produced. Pricing for the initial configuration of the B787-8 is generally established through 2021, with prices decreasing as cumulative volume levels are achieved. Prices are subject to adjustment for abnormal inflation (above a specified level in any year) and for certain production, schedule and other specific changes. The B787 Supply Agreement provides that initial prices for the B787-9 and B787-10 are to be determined by a procedure set out in the B787 Supply Agreement, and to be documented by amendment once that amendment has been agreed to by the parties. In November 2014, Spirit and Boeing entered into a Memorandum of Agreement pursuant to which the companies established near term interim prices for certain B787 shipsets, subject to resolution of recurring prices, future rate increases and other issues across multiple programs in 2015. During this period, while negotiations on these issues are ongoing, Spirit will record appropriate portions of the interim prices on certain 787-8 and 787-9 shipsets as deferred revenue, which will be recognized as revenue only if and when the parties reach resolution on the various issues. The parties have engaged in discussions concerning how to determine subsequent B787-9 and initial B787-10 prices, and have not yet reached agreement. Our ability to obtain fair and equitable prices for deliveries and models could impact the profitability of the overall program. Additionally, we cannot give any assurance that our development of new technologies or capabilities will be successful or that we will be able to reduce our B787 production costs over the life of the program. A failure to reduce production costs or to obtain pricing as we have anticipated could result in the need to record additional forward losses for this program.\nMany of our other production cost estimates also contain pricing terms which anticipate cost reductions over time. In addition, although we have entered into these fixed price contracts with our customers, they may nonetheless seek to re-negotiate pricing with us in the future. Any such higher costs or re-negotiations could materially adversely affect our profitability, margins and revenues.\nCertain of our long-term supply agreements provide for re-negotiation of established pricing terms at specified times. In particular, pricing terms under our supply agreement with Boeing for the B737, B747, B767 and B777 platforms, which accounted for 65% of our net revenues in 2014, expired in May 2013, thus activating interim pricing provisions under the Supply Agreement. On April 8, 2014, the parties agreed on pricing through December 31, 2015. We are required to negotiate the pricing beyond 2015 in good faith. In addition, our agreement with Boeing on interim pricing for the B787-8 and B787-9 is contingent on the parties reaching agreement by December 31, 2015 on, among other things, future pricing on the B737, B747, B767 and B777 platforms. Until we are able to agree upon future pricing on the B737, B747, B767 and B777 platforms, pricing beyond 2015 will be determined according to then-existing prices, adjusted using a quantity-based price adjustment formula and specified annual escalation. If we agree on future pricing that provides us with operating margins that are lower than those which we currently experience, or if we are unable to agree on future pricing terms and the default pricing terms remain in effect for an extended period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are involved in a number of litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In\naddition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to the heavily regulated nature of our industry and our participation on government programs. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to manage and support a variety of business activities, including procurement and supply chain, engineering support, and manufacturing. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. In addition, security failures or breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our manufacturing process could be disrupted resulting in late deliveries or even no deliveries if there is a total shutdown.\nWe do not own most of the intellectual property and tooling used in our business.\nOur business depends on using certain intellectual property and tooling that we have rights to use under license grants from Boeing. These licenses contain restrictions on our use of Boeing intellectual property and tooling and may be terminated if we default under certain of these restrictions. Our loss of license rights to use Boeing intellectual property or tooling would materially adversely affect our business. See \"Business - Our Relationship with Boeing - License of Intellectual Property.\" In addition to the licenses with Boeing, we license some of the intellectual property needed for performance under some of our supply contracts from our customers under those supply agreements. We must honor our contractual commitments to our customers related to intellectual property and comply with infringement laws governing our use of intellectual property. In the event we obtain new business from new or existing customers, we will need to pay particular attention to these contractual commitments and any other restrictions on our use of intellectual property to make sure that we will not be using intellectual property improperly in the performance of such new business. In the event we use any such intellectual property improperly, we could be subject to an infringement claim by the owner or licensee of such intellectual property.\nIn the future, our entry into new markets may require obtaining additional license grants from Boeing and/or from other third parties. If we are unable to negotiate additional license rights on acceptable terms (or at all) from Boeing and/or other third parties as the need arises, our ability to enter new markets may be materially restricted. In addition, we may be subject to restrictions in future licenses granted to us that may materially restrict our use of third party intellectual property.\nOur success depends in part on the success of our research and development initiatives.\nWe spent approximately $29.3 million on research and development during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Our expenditures on our research and development efforts may not create any new sales opportunities or increases in productivity that are commensurate with the level of resources invested.\nWe are in the process of developing specific technologies and capabilities in pursuit of new business and in anticipation of customers going forward with new programs. If any such programs do not go forward or are not successful, we may be unable to recover the costs incurred in anticipation of such programs and our profitability and revenues may be materially adversely affected.\nAny future business combinations, acquisitions, mergers, or joint ventures will expose us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses or achieve expected operating synergies.\nWe actively consider strategic transactions from time to time. We evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances and co-production programs as opportunities arise, and we may be engaged in varying levels of negotiations with potential competitors at any time. We may not be able to effect transactions with strategic alliance, acquisition or co-production program candidates on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we enter into these transactions, we also may not realize the benefits we anticipate. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing for these transactions. The integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndemands on management related to the increase in size after the transaction;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the assimilation of geographically dispersed operations and personnel, who may speak different languages;\n\u2022\ndifficulties combining operations that use different currencies or operate under different legal structures;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of departments, systems (including accounting systems), technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls (including internal accounting controls), procedures and policies;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws; and\n\u2022\nconstraints (contractual or otherwise) limiting our ability to consolidate, rationalize and/or leverage supplier arrangements to achieve integration.\nConsummating any acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances or co-production programs could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities.\nWe could be required to make future contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets.\nOur estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other post-retirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality). A dramatic decrease in the fair value of our plan assets resulting from movements in the financial markets may cause the status of our plans to go from an over-funded status to an under-funded status and result in cash funding requirements to meet any minimum required funding levels. Our results of operations, liquidity, or shareholders' equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets, the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, or changes in employee workforce assumptions.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe had previously identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as it relates to the completeness, accuracy and valuation of inventory and cost of sales related to the Airbus A350 XWB Section 15 recurring program. Specifically, we did not maintain controls over the completeness and accuracy of the bill of materials used in the contract accounting estimate for this program. As of December 31, 2014, we have remediated our material weakness. We cannot assure that additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or failure to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and/or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, potentially leading to a decline in our share price.\nOur business jet programs are sensitive to consumer preferences in the business jet market.\nOur business jet program success is tied to demand for products from the manufacturers with whom we contract. The business jet market is impacted by consumer preference for different business jet models. If demand for new aircraft from our customers decreases, there would likely be a corresponding decrease in demand for our business jet products, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business. The terms of the indentures governing our long-term bonds and our senior secured credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our company and our subsidiaries, which could also adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage by preventing us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had total debt of approximately $1,153.5 million, including approximately $534.4 million of borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, $599.5 million of long-term bonds, a $6.7 million Malaysian loan, and approximately $12.9 million of capital lease obligations. In addition to our debt, as of December 31, 2014, we had $21.6 million of letters of guarantee outstanding.\nThe terms of the indentures governing our long-term bonds and our senior secured credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\nacquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies; and\n\u2022\nincur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions or transfer assets to us.\nThese restrictions could have consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our financial flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nhaving a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the covenants in the senior secured credit facility or in the indentures governing our long-term bonds or in the instruments governing our other debt; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nOur existing senior secured revolving credit facility, which matures on April 18, 2017, is a significant source of liquidity for our business. The failure to extend or renew this agreement could have a significant effect on our ability to invest sufficiently in our programs, fund day to day operations, or pursue strategic opportunities.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness in the future or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nIn addition, despite the restrictions and limitations described above, subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. If we incur additional debt, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify.\nIn addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations, or raise additional debt or equity capital. We cannot provide assurance that we could affect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that these actions would be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from effecting certain or any of these alternatives.\nGlobal credit markets are subject to numerous risk factors, including but not limited to concerns over sovereign debt in Europe and elsewhere; the impact and effectiveness of new financial legislation and regulation in the United States and Europe; the impact of those reforms on borrowers, financial institutions and credit rating agencies; potential systemic risk resulting from the interrelationship of credit market products and participants; global governmental and central banking policies; and conflict and political instability in the Middle East and Asia. There can be no assurance that access to credit markets will continue to be available to us.\nAny reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our corporate credit ratings were a BB- rating, stable outlook by Standard & Poor's, and a Ba2, rating under review for possible upgrade by Moody's Investor Services.\nThe ratings reflect the agencies' assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal on our debt securities and credit agreements. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be considered independently of all other ratings. Lower ratings would typically result in higher interest costs of debt securities when they are sold, and could make it more difficult to issue future debt securities. In addition, a downgrade in our fixed or revolving long-term debt rating could result in an increase in borrowing costs under our senior secured credit facility and could trigger a prepayment based on the excess cash flow prepayment provision under our term loan depending on our total leverage ratio. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could thus have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nWe may sell more equity and reduce your ownership in Spirit Holdings.\nOur business plan may require the investment of new capital, which we may raise by issuing additional equity (including equity interests which may have a preference over shares of our class A common stock) or additional debt (including debt securities and/or bank loans). However, this capital may not be available at all, or when needed, or upon terms and conditions favorable to us. The issuance of additional equity in Spirit Holdings may result in significant dilution of shares of our class A common stock. We may issue additional equity in connection with or to finance acquisitions. Further, our subsidiaries could issue securities in the future to persons or entities (including our affiliates) other than us or another subsidiary. This could materially adversely affect your investment in us because it would dilute your indirect ownership interest in our subsidiaries.\nSpirit Holdings' certificate of incorporation and by-laws and our supply agreements with Boeing contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Spirit Holdings' certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 10 million shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and an additional 58,683,057 shares of class A common stock (net of shares issued but subject to vesting requirements under our benefit plans and shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding shares of class B common stock and shares issued pursuant to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan) and an additional 149,767,435 shares of class B common stock.\nIn addition, our supply agreements with Boeing include provisions giving Boeing the ability to terminate the agreements in the event any of certain disqualified persons acquire a majority of Spirit's direct or indirect voting power or all or substantially all of Spirit's assets. See \"Business - Our Relationship with Boeing.\"\nAlthough we are no longer a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d)rules, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during a one-year transition period.\nAs of June 2014, the Onex entities no longer control a majority of our voting common stock. As a result, we no longer qualify as a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. The NYSE rules require that we appoint a majority of independent directors to the Board of Directors within one year of the date we no longer qualify as a \"controlled company.\" The NYSE rules also require that we appoint at least one independent member to each of the compensation and nominating and governance committees prior to the date we no longer qualify as a \"controlled company,\" and that each such committee be composed of at least a majority of independent members within 90 days of such date and that each such committee be composed entirely of independent directors within one year of such date. During these transition periods, we may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nAccordingly, during these transition periods, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nPrice fluctuations in our class A common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in aerostructures pricing;\n\u2022\nour competitors' and customers' announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nchanges in our growth rates or our competitors' and customers' growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe timing or results of regulatory submissions or actions with respect to our business;\n\u2022\nour inability to finance or raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nconditions of the aerostructure industry, in the financial markets, or economic conditions in general; and\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our class A common stock, other comparable companies or the aerospace industry in general.", "PERMNO": 91594, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "SPR"}
