{"cik": "1005817", "company": "TOMPKINS FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur Company's success is dependent on management's ability to identify and manage the risks inherent in our financial services business. These risks include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and reputation risk. We list below the material risk factors we face. Any of these risks could result in a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow, or may cause our results to vary materially from recent results, or from the results implied by any forward-looking statements made by us.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nThe Company is subject to increased business risk because the Company has a significant concentration of commercial real estate and commercial business loans, repayment of which is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower.\nThe Company offers different types of commercial loans to a variety of businesses, and we believe commercial loans will continue to comprise a significant concentration of our loan portfolio in 2019 and beyond. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral-based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan-to-collateral values. As such, declines in real estate valuations in the Company\u2019s market area would lower the value of the collateral securing these loans. Additionally, the Company has experienced, and expects to continue experiencing, increased competition in commercial real estate lending. This increased competition may inhibit the Company's ability to generate additional commercial real estate loans or maintain its current inventory of commercial real estate loans. The Company\u2019s commercial business loans are made based primarily on the cash flow and creditworthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower, with liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. The borrowers\u2019 cash flow may be difficult to predict, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment. As of December 31, 2018, commercial and commercial real estate loans totaled $3.4 billion or 70.7% of total loans.\nThe Company\u2019s agricultural loans are often dependent upon the health of the agricultural industry in the location of the borrower, and the ability of the borrower to repay may be affected by many factors outside of the borrower\u2019s control.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s commercial business lending activities, the Company originates agricultural loans, consisting of agricultural real estate loans and agricultural operating loans. As of December 31, 2018, $277.7 million or 5.7% of the Company\u2019s total loan portfolio consisted of agriculturally-related loans, including $170.2 million in agricultural real estate loans and $107.5 million in agricultural operating loans. Payments on agricultural loans are dependent on the profitable operation or management of the related farm property. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields (such as hail, drought and floods), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products and the impact of governmental regulations and subsidies (including changes in price supports and environmental regulations). Many farms are dependent upon a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. While agricultural operating loans are generally secured by a blanket lien on the farm\u2019s operating assets, any repossessed collateral in respect of a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding balance.\nAdditionally, the profitable operation or management of the related farm properties, and the value thereof, is impacted by changes in U.S. government trade policies. In 2018, the U.S. government implemented tariffs on certain products, and certain countries or\nentities, such as Mexico, Canada, China and the European Union, have issued or continue to threaten retaliatory tariffs against products from the United States, including agricultural products. Tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that farm properties related to our agriculturally-related loans import or export could cause the costs of such farm operations and management to increase, could cause the price of products from such farm operations to increase, could cause demand for such products to decrease and could cause the margins on such products to decrease. Such potential adverse effects on related farm property operations and management could reduce the related farm properties\u2019 revenues, financial results and ability to service debt, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nDeclines in asset values may result in impairment charges and may adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA majority of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio is comprised of securities which are collateralized by residential mortgages. These residential mortgage-backed securities include securities of U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored entities, and private-label collateralized mortgage obligations. The Company\u2019s securities portfolio also includes obligations of\nU.S. government-sponsored entities, obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof, U.S. corporate debt securities and equity securities. A more detailed discussion of the investment portfolio, including types of securities held, the carrying and fair values, and contractual maturities is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. Gains or losses on these instruments may have a direct impact on the results of operations, including higher or lower income and earnings, unless we adequately hedge our positions. The fair value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the obligations themselves, such as rating downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate, a lack of liquidity for resale of certain investment securities and changes in interest rates. For example, decreases in interest rates and increases in mortgage prepayment speeds, which are influenced by interest rates and other factors, could adversely impact the value of our securities collateralized by residential mortgages, causing a significant acceleration of purchase premium amortization on our mortgage portfolio because a decline in long-term interest rates shortens the expected lives of the securities. Conversely, increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations and mortgage prepayment speeds, directly impacting the value of these securities collateralized by residential mortgages. The Company periodically, but not less than quarterly, evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). A decline in the fair value of the securities in our investment portfolio could result in an other-than temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) write-down that could reduce our earnings. Further, given the significant judgments involved, if we are incorrect in our assessment of OTTI, this error could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nA decline in the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had $99.9 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company is required to test its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis. A significant decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets. If we make an impairment determination in a future reporting period, the Company\u2019s earnings and the book value of these intangible assets would be reduced by the amount of the impairment. Further, a goodwill impairment charge could significantly restrict the ability of our banking subsidiaries to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FASB has recently issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASU 2016-13\") , which replaces the current \"incurred loss\" model for recognizing credit losses with an \"expected loss\" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held to maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model required under current U.S. GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, the Company expects that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine the\nallowance for loan losses and could require the Company to increase our allowance significantly. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If the Company is required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. The most important counterparty for the Company, in terms of liquidity, is the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\u201cFHLBNY\u201d). The Company also has a relationship with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (\u201cFHLBPITT\u201d). The Company uses FHLBNY as its primary source of overnight funds and also has long-term advances and repurchase agreements with FHLBNY. The Company has placed sufficient collateral in the form of commercial and residential real estate loans at FHLBNY. In addition, the Company is required to hold stock in FHLBNY and FHLBPITT. The amount of borrowed funds and repurchase agreements with the FHLBNY and FHLBPITT, and the amount of FHLBNY and FHLBPITT stock held by the Company, at its most recent fiscal year-end are discussed in Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K.\nThere are 11 branches of the FHLB, including New York and Pittsburgh. The FHLBNY and the FHLBPITT are jointly and severally liable along with the other Federal Home Loan Banks for the consolidated obligations issued on behalf of the Federal Home Loan Banks through the Office of Finance. Dividends on, redemption of, or repurchase of shares of the FHLBNY\u2019s or FHLBPITT\u2019s capital stock cannot occur unless the principal and interest due on all consolidated obligations have been paid in full. If another Federal Home Loan Bank were to default on its obligation to pay principal or interest on any consolidated obligations, the Federal Home Loan Finance Agency (the \u201cFinance Agency\u201d) may allocate the outstanding liability among one or more of the remaining Federal Home Loan Banks on a pro rata basis or on any other basis the Finance Agency may determine. As a result, the FHLBNY\u2019s or FHLBPITT\u2019s ability to pay dividends on, to redeem, or to repurchase shares of capital stock could be affected by the financial condition of one or more of the other Federal Home Loan Banks. Any such adverse effects on the FHLBNY or FHLBPITT could adversely affect our liquidity, the value of our investment in FHLBNY or FHLBPITT common stock, and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nSystemic weakness in the FHLB could result in higher costs of FHLB borrowings, reduced value of FHLB stock, and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive, such as brokered time deposits, the discount window at the Federal Reserve, or lines of credit with correspondent banks. Any of these scenarios could adversely affect our liquidity, the value of our investment in FHLB common stock and our financial condition.\nThe Company relies on cash dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its operations, and payment of those dividends could be discontinued at any time.\nThe Company is a financial holding company whose principal assets and sources of income are its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries, and therefore the Company relies primarily on dividends from these banking and other subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to provide funds for the payment of dividends to the Company\u2019s shareholders, to the extent declared by the Company\u2019s board of directors. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company and impose regulatory capital and liquidity requirements on the Company and its banking subsidiaries. Further, as a holding company, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors (including, in the case of the Company\u2019s banking subsidiaries, the banks\u2019 depositors). If the Company were unable to receive dividends from its subsidiaries it would materially and adversely affects the Company\u2019s liquidity and its ability to service its debt, pay its other obligations, or pay cash dividends on its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by general economic conditions in local and national markets, the possibility of the economy\u2019s return to recessionary conditions and the possibility of further turmoil or volatility in the financial markets.\nGeneral economic conditions impact the banking and financial services industry. The U.S. and global economies have experienced volatility in recent years and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will not deteriorate. Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions can be caused by many macro and micro factors, including declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, the timing and impact of changing governmental policies and other factors. The Company is particularly affected by U.S domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates, the\nunemployment rate, housing prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending, the number of personal bankruptcies and other factors. A decline in U.S. domestic business and economic conditions, without rapid recovery, could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nconsumer and business confidence levels could be lowered and cause declines in credit usage, adverse changes in payment patterns, decreases in demand for loans or other financial products and services and decreases in deposits or investments in accounts with Company;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches the Company uses to select, manage and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future behaviors;\n\u2022\ndemand for and income received from the Company's fee-based services, including investment services and insurance commissions and fees, could continue to decline, the cost to the Company to provide any or all products and services could increase and the levels of assets under management could materially impact revenues from our trust and wealth management businesses; and\n\u2022\nthe credit quality or value of loans and other assets or collateral securing loans may decrease.\nOur business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the general geographic markets in which we operate.\nOur operations are heavily concentrated in the New York State and, to a lesser extent, Pennsylvania and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in the economic conditions in those areas. Therefore, the Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay the principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing these loans, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, particularly New York State and Pennsylvania. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Although our clients\u2019 business and financial interests may extend well beyond these markets, adverse economic conditions that affect these markets could disproportionately reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our clients to repay their loans to us, affect the value of collateral underlying loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets. For additional information on our market area, see Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Report on Form 10-K.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in fiscal and monetary policy in the United States.\nUncertainties surrounding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. For example, actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including the announced changes in the size of its balance sheet and the announced changes to its \"quantitative easing\" program and \u201ctapering,\u201d are beyond our control, difficult to predict and can affect interest rates and the value and credit quality of our loan portfolio and the value of our other assets, and can adversely impact our borrowers\u2019 ability to borrow and ability to repay their debt to us. We cannot predict the timing or extent of future changes in fiscal and monetary policy and, as a result, we cannot predict the effect on our operations and revenues.\nOur insurance agency subsidiary\u2019s commission revenues are based on premiums set by insurers and any decreases in these premium rates could adversely affect our operations and revenues.\nOur insurance agency subsidiary, Tompkins Insurance, derives the bulk of its revenue from commissions paid by insurance underwriters on the sale of insurance products to clients. Tompkins Insurance does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are based. Insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. As a result, insurance brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile. Revenue from insurance commissions and fees could be negatively affected by fluctuations in insurance premiums and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including changes in laws and regulations impacting the healthcare and insurance markets. In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, increased use of self-insurance, captives, and risk retention groups. Even if Tompkins Insurance is able to participate in these activities, it is unlikely to realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities. We cannot predict the timing or extent of future changes in premiums and thus commissions. As a result, we cannot predict the effect that future premium rates will have on our operations. Decreases in premium rates could adversely affect our operations and revenues.\nThe Company is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and other market risks, which could materially and adversely affect our earnings, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings, financial condition and liquidity are susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates. Interest rates are affected by many factors which are outside of our control, including financial regulation, economic/monetary policy, and political conditions, and other factors. In particular, the recent changes in U.S. economic and monetary policy may indicate that the FRB will continue to raise short-term interest rates over the next several quarters. The announced ending of the FRB\u2019s program of \"quantitative easing\", and initiation of a \u201ctapering\u201d program, which may lead to a smaller FRB balance sheet and, in turn, impact market interest rates and liquidity availability. Net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings, is our primary source of revenue, and could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. For example, if interest rates rise, our funding costs, particularly the cost of deposits, may also begin to rise with a trajectory influenced by the absolute level of interest rates, the pace of interest rate increases and the rate of loan growth.\nA rise in the costs of deposits, influenced by the rates that our competitors pay on deposits, may result in an increase in our funding cost, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding, either of which may adversely impact our net interest margin and net interest income. The cost of deposits has risen and may continue to rise. Changes in interest rates may have a different effect on the interest earned on our assets than it does on the interest paid on our borrowings or other liabilities. This is because our assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. Generally, the impact on earnings stemming from interest rate shifts is more adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens; that is, when short-term interest rates increase more than long-term interest rates or when long-term interest rates decrease more than short-term interest rates. The level of net interest income is dependent upon the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the level of nonperforming assets, and the level and trend of interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will also affect the level of prepayments on the Company\u2019s loans and payments on mortgage-backed securities, resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including: inflation, economic growth, employment levels, monetary policy and international markets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. The Company\u2019s efforts to manage interest rate risk may not be sufficient to prevent these adverse outcomes.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for the Company\u2019s borrowers, which increase the potential for default by our borrowers. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates. Changes in interest rates can also affect the value of loans, securities and other assets which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nFor information about how the Company manages its interest rate risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d of this Report.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient cash flow and liquid assets to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. As we continue to grow, we are likely to become more dependent on these sources, which may include various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, proceeds from the sale of loans, and borrowings from the FHLBNY and FHLBPITT and others. We also maintain available lines of credit with the FHLBNY and FHLBPITT that are secured by loans. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could make it difficult or impossible for us to access these additional funding sources and could make our existing funds more volatile. Our financial flexibility could be materially constrained if we are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In that case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Further, the volatility inherent in some of these funding sources, particularly including brokered deposits, may increase our exposure to liquidity risk. Any interruption in these sources of liquidity when needed could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow or regulatory capital levels. In addition, reduced liquidity could result from circumstances beyond our control, such as general market disruptions or operational problems that affect us or third parties. Management\u2019s efforts to closely monitor our liquidity position for compliance with internal policies may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in liquidity.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely impacted by current or future laws and regulations due to increased compliance costs, potential fines for noncompliance, and restrictions on our ability to offer products or buy or sell businesses.\nThe Company is subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations, supervision and legislation that affect how it\nconducts its business. The majority of these laws and regulations are for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds. The regulations influence such things as the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, and dividend policy. The Dodd-Frank Act, which established the CFPB, and enacted other reforms, has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. Compliance with these regulations and other initiatives negatively impacts revenue and increases the cost of doing business on an ongoing basis. Further, under the current climate of regulatory reform, the future of currently effective, proposed and potential future regulations and legislation is unclear. New regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could necessitate changes to the Company\u2019s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Refer to \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 - \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Report on Form 10-K for additional information on material laws and regulations impacting the Company\u2019s business.\nAs discussed above under the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section, under Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act the federal banking agencies established stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and bank holding companies. These requirements, and any additional requirements adopted in the future, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends, or could require it to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, banking regulators are authorized to take supervisory actions that may restrict or limit a financial institution's activities. Regulatory restrictions on our activities could adversely affect our costs and revenues, and may impair our ability to execute our strategic plans. In addition, if our regulators identify a compliance failure, we may be assessed a fine, prohibited from completing a strategic acquisition or divestiture, or subject to other actions imposed by the regulatory authorities. The recent regulatory activity and increased scrutiny have resulted, and may continue to result, in increases in our costs of doing business, and could result in decreased revenues and net income, reduce our ability to effectively compete to attract and retain customers, or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services. Any future changes in federal or state law and regulations, as well as the interpretations and implementations, or modifications or repeals, of such laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an organization focused on building comprehensive relationships with clients, employees and the communities we serve, our reputation is critical to our business, and damage to it could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nOur success as a Company relies on maintaining the value of our brand and our good reputation with our current and potential customers and employees. Through our branding, we communicate to the market about our Company and our product and service offerings. Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining clients and employees. Accordingly, reputational damage would likely have a materially adverse impact on our business prospects and our ability to execute on our business strategy. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including regulatory actions or fines, improperly handled conflicts of interest, operating system failures or security breaches, customer complaints, litigation, actual or perceived employee misconduct, misconduct by our outsourced service providers or other counterparties, or other unethical or improper behavior conducted by our Company or affiliated service providers or other counterparties could all cause harm to our reputation, impair our ability to attract and retain customers, make it more difficult or expensive to obtain external funding and have other adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding us or any of our subsidiaries, whether or not accurate, may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company could be subject to environmental risks and associated costs on real estate properties owned by the Company, real estate properties that collateralize the Company\u2019s loans or real estate properties that the Company obtains title to.\nThe Company owns various properties used in the operation of its business. In addition, from time to time, the Company forecloses on properties or may be deemed to become involved in the management of its borrowers\u2019 properties. The Company could be subject to environmental liabilities imposed by applicable federal and state laws with respect to any of these properties. For example, we may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases, at a property, or may be subject to common law claims by third parties for damages and costs\nresulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Additionally, a significant portion of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 was secured by real estate and, if the real estate securing our assets is subject to environmental liability, our collateral position may be substantially weakened. Any such environmental liabilities imposed on the Company could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company may be exposed to regulatory sanctions or liability if we do not timely detect and report money laundering or other illegal activities.\nWe are required to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws. These laws and regulations require us, among things, to enact policies and procedures to confirm the identity of our customers, and to report suspicious transactions to regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations are complex and require costly, sophisticated monitoring systems and qualified personnel. The policies and procedures that we have adopted in order to detect and prevent such illegal transactions may not be successful in eliminating all instances of such transactions. To the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, we face the possibility of fines or other penalties, such as restrictions on our business activities, and we may also suffer reputational harm, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Refer to \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 - \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Report on Form 10-K for additional information on anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws impacting the Company\u2019s business.\nWe will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements if we exceed $10 billion in total consolidated assets.\nBased on our historical growth rates and current size, it is possible that our total assets could exceed $10 billion dollars in the future. Our total consolidated assets on December 31, 2018 were $6.8 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose enhanced supervisory requirements on bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets.\nIn addition to the additional regulatory requirements that we will become subject to upon crossing this asset threshold, federal financial regulators may require the Company to, or the Company may proactively, take actions to prepare for compliance with such increased regulations before we exceed $10 billion in total consolidated assets. We may, therefore, incur significant compliance costs in an effort to ensure compliance before we reach $10 billion in total consolidated assets. These additional compliance costs, if they occur, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local tax law or interpretations of existing tax law could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates. The estimated impact of the new law is based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results in fiscal 2018 and our further analysis of the new law. Refer to \"Note 14 Income Taxes\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Report for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive industry and market areas.\nCompetition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the Company\u2019s market areas. In one or more aspects of its business, the Company\u2019s subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, Internet-based financial services companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices, or otherwise solicit deposits, or have announced plans to do so in the Company\u2019s market areas. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities than the Company and may offer services that the Company does not currently provide. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive Federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and Federally-insured banks. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Additionally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Failure to compete effectively to attract new and\nretain current customers could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological changes and the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could hurt our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services which increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to serve customers better and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to leverage technology to increase our operational efficiency as well as address the current and evolving needs of our customers. However, our competitors may have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, we may not always have capital levels which are sufficient to support a robust investment in our technology infrastructure or we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to offer our customers an evolving suite of products and services, and we may not be able to effectively manage the risks inherent in the development of financial products and services.\nWe continually monitor our suite of products and services, and prioritize new offerings based on our determination of customer demand, within regulatory parameters for financial products. We may invest significant time and resources in new products which become obsolete, or do not generate the revenues we had anticipated, or which are ultimately deemed unacceptable by regulatory authorities. As we expand the range and complexity of our products and services, we are exposed to increasingly complex risks, including potential fraud, and our employees and risk management systems may not be adequate to mitigate such risks effectively. Our failure to effectively identify and manage these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by fraud.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is inherently exposed to operational risk in the form of theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, customers and other third parties targeting the Company and/or the Company\u2019s customers or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Although the Company devotes substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, the Company may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud. Fraudulent activity could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of sensitive data, which is subject to extensive regulation and oversight and exposes our business to additional risks.\nIn our ordinary course of business, we collect and retain large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal Company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by cybersecurity threats attempting to misappropriate passwords, bank account information or other personal information. Our attempts to mitigate these threats may not be successful as cybercrimes are complex and continue to evolve. Publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could cause us to incur reputational harm and discourage our customers from using our electronic or web-based applications or solutions, which could harm their utility as a means of conducting commercial transactions.\nEven the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in breach attempts or other disruptions are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. A security breach or other significant disruption of our information systems or those related to our customers, merchants and our third party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our internal, or our third-party vendors\u2019, networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers; (iii) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose the us to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; (iv) require significant management attention\nand resources to remedy the damages that result; or (v) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA breach of information or other technological security, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business we rely on electronic communications and information systems, both internal and provided by external third parties, to conduct our operations and to store, process, and/or transmit sensitive data on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the Internet. We cannot be certain that all of our systems, or third-party systems upon which we rely, are free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses, phishing, denial of service attacks and other means of intrusion that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer or employee information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. If information security is breached or difficulties or failures occur, despite the controls we and our third party vendors have instituted, information may be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs, reputational harm or damages and litigation, regulatory investigation costs or remediation costs to us or others. While we maintain specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of many breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. Furthermore, because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some breaches may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has significantly increased, in part due to the expansion of new technologies, the increased use of the Internet and mobile services and the increased intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world. The threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe Company is subject to risks presented by acquisitions, which, if realized, could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s strategic initiatives include diversification within its markets, growth of its fee-based businesses, and growth internally and through acquisitions of financial institutions, branches, and financial services businesses. As such, the Company has acquired, and from time to time considers acquiring, banks, thrift institutions, branch offices of banks or thrift institutions, or other businesses within markets currently served by the Company or in other locations that would complement the Company\u2019s business or its geographic reach. In 2018, the Company did not initiate or complete any acquisitions considering, in part, the increased competition with other regional banks for strategic acquisitions. Additionally, future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include: the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the potential disruption of our ongoing business, the inability of management to realize or maximize anticipated financial and strategic positions, increased operating costs, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, the difficulty and cost of obtaining adequate financing, the potential for litigation risk, the potential loss of members of a key executive management group, the potential reputational damage and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of an acquired company may deteriorate after the acquisition agreement is signed or after the acquisition closes. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions and any of these risks, if realized, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's operations may be adversely affected if its external vendors do not perform as expected or if its access to third-party services is interrupted.\nThe Company relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain the day-to-day operations of the Company. Some of the products and services provided by vendors include key components of our business infrastructure including data processing and storage and internet connections and network access, among other products and services. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations. If we are unable to find alternative sources for our vendors\u2019 services and products quickly and cost-effectively, the failures of our vendors could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may be volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, including: actual or anticipated variations in our operating results; recommendations by securities analysts; significant acquisitions or business combinations; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to Tompkins; new technology used, or services offered by our competitors; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry; and changes in government regulations. Other factors, including general market fluctuations, industry-wide factors and economic and general political conditions and events, including foreign and national governmental policy decisions, terrorist attacks, economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends or currency fluctuations, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s stock price even though they do not directly pertain to the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of larger financial services companies, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is traded on the NYSE American. The trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock is less than that of larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire the Company\u2019s common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment.\nWe may not pay, or may reduce, the dividends paid on our common stock.\nHolders of Tompkins\u2019 common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as its board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. While Tompkins has a long history of paying dividends on its common stock, Tompkins is not required to pay dividends on its common stock and could reduce or eliminate its common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of Tompkins\u2019 common stock. Also, Tompkins is a bank holding company, and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for a description of certain material limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to shareholders.", "PERMNO": 10308, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TMP"}
