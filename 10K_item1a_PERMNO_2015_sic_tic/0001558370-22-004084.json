{"cik": "1011509", "company": "Golden Minerals Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A:RISK FACTORS\nInvestors in Golden Minerals should consider carefully, in addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors:\nRisk Factors related to our Financial Circumstances\nWe are an exploration stage company and do not have a long-term source of revenue.\nWe have a history of operating losses. Although our Rodeo project generated revenue and free cash flow commencing in 2021, that project is short-lived and is not expected to generate significant cash flow beyond 2023. We are evaluating other potential mining activities, including a potential restart of mineral extraction at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties. However, we do not currently have any mining activities scheduled to commence after the termination of mining at the Rodeo Property. If we are unable to generate revenue from another mining property, we will be dependent on future external financing to fund our corporate expenses and exploration activities. There is no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. See \u201cRisk Factors - We may not have access to sufficient future capital.\u201d\nOur results of operations, cash flows and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the market prices of gold and silver and certain base metals, and these prices can be volatile.\nThe profitability of our mining operations and the value of our mining properties are directly related to the market price of gold, silver, and certain base metals. The price of gold and silver may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock. The market prices of these metals historically have fluctuated significantly and are\naffected by numerous factors beyond our control, including (i) global or regional consumption patterns; (ii) supply of and demand for silver and gold on a worldwide basis; (iii) speculative and hedging activities; (iv) expectations for inflation; (v) political and economic conditions; (vi) supply of, and demand for, consumables required for extraction and processing of metals, and (vii) general economic conditions worldwide.\nIn the event metal prices decline or remain low for prolonged periods of time, we might be unable to develop our exploration properties, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance, and cash flows. An asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our Rodeo mine or the market value of our non-producing properties, including a material diminution in the price of metals.\nWe may not continue to be profitable.\nProfitability at our Rodeo mine is subject to uncertainty. See \u201cRisk Factors - The assumptions behind our estimates of cash flow and profitability at the Rodeo mine are inherently subject to uncertainty.\u201d Unexpected interruptions in our mining business may cause us to incur losses, or the revenue that we generate from extraction may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations including exploration and development costs. Our failure to generate future profits may adversely affect the price of our common stock and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. Metal prices have a significant impact on our profit margin and there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the future. See \u201cRisk Factors - Our results of operations, cash flows and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the market prices of gold and silver and certain base metals, and these prices can be volatile.\u201d\nWe may not have access to sufficient future capital.\nAlthough the Rodeo Property is expected to generate revenue and free cash flow through much of 2023, we expect to require additional external financing to fund our continuing business activities. We may be required to expend significant funds to determine if mineral reserves exist at any of our other properties, continue exploration, and if warranted, develop our existing properties and identify and acquire additional properties to diversify our property portfolio.\nWe do not have a credit, off-take or other commercial financing arrangement in place that would finance our general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities in the future, and we believe that securing credit for these purposes would be challenging. In addition, commercial financing arrangements may not be available on favorable terms or on terms that would not further restrict our flexibility and ongoing ability to meet our cash requirements over a reasonable period of time.\nWe also may not be able to obtain funding by monetizing additional non-core exploration or other assets at an acceptable price. Although we may be able to access public equity markets, including through issuances under our At the Market Offering Program with H.C. Wainwright & Co. (\u201cATM Program\u201d), significant equity issuances may be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing to fund our general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities in the future on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further mining operations or exploration and construction and the possible partial or total loss of our interest in our properties.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nIncreased operating and capital costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOperating costs at our Rodeo mine are subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing-related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make mineral extraction less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs could have a significant effect on our results of operations and operating cash flow.\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control, such as inflation or due to supply chain constraints or delays. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects, or may make the development of future projects uneconomic.\nThe assumptions behind our estimates of cash flow and profitability at the Rodeo mine are inherently subject to uncertainty.\nWe have not established mineral reserves as defined under S-K 1300 at the Rodeo mine. As a result, despite the fact that we have undertaken confirmatory drilling to provide additional certainty regarding the Rodeo deposit, there is increased uncertainty and risk that may result in economic or technical failure which may adversely impact our future profitability. In making the decision to commence mining, we made certain assumptions regarding operating and capital costs and project economic returns. These estimates of average cash operating costs are based upon, among other things, (i) anticipated tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed; (ii) anticipated recovery rates of silver and other metals from the ore; (iii) cash operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment; and (iv) anticipated climatic conditions. Actual cash operating costs, production and economic returns may differ significantly from those anticipated by our studies and estimates.\nWe are party to a collective bargaining agreement with a union in Mexico that, together with labor and employment regulations, could adversely affect our mining activities and financial condition.\nMine employees in Mexico are typically represented by a union, and our relationship with our employees is, and we expect in the future will be, governed in part by collective bargaining agreements. Any collective bargaining agreement that we enter into with a union is likely to restrict our mining flexibility in and impose additional costs on our mining activities. In addition, relations between us and our employees in Mexico may be affected by changes in regulations or labor union requirements regarding labor relations that may be introduced by the Mexican authorities or by labor unions. Changes in legislation or in the relationship between us and our employees may have a material adverse effect on our mining activities and financial condition.\nCompetition in the mining industry is intense, and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete.\nCompetition in the mining industry for desirable properties, investment capital and human capital is intense. Numerous companies headquartered in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere throughout the world compete for properties and human capital on a global basis. We are a small participant in the mining industry due to our limited financial and human capital resources. We presently operate with a limited number of people and we anticipate operating in the same manner going forward. We compete with other companies in our industry to hire qualified employees and consultants when needed to successfully operate the Rodeo mine, the Velarde\u00f1a processing facility, and to advance our exploration\nproperties. We may be unable to attract the necessary human capital to fully explore, and if warranted, develop our properties and be unable to acquire other desirable properties. We believe that competition for acquiring mineral properties, as well as the competition to attract and retain qualified human capital, will continue to be intense in the future.\nProducts processed from our Rodeo project or other mines in the future could contain higher than expected contaminants, thereby negatively impacting our financial condition.\nTreatment charges paid to smelters and refineries include penalties for certain elements, including arsenic and antimony that exceed contract limits. If the material mined from our Rodeo project includes higher than expected contaminants, this would result in higher treatment expenses and penalty charges that could increase our costs and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. This could occur due to unexpected variations in the occurrence of these elements in the material mined, problems that occur during blending of material from various locations in the mine prior to processing and other unanticipated events.\nConditions of our mining and processing activities are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining activities.\nWater is critical to our business, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our management approach. Across the globe, water is a shared and regulated resource. Mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our properties in Mexico and Argentina are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development are dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although we believe that our operations currently have sufficient water rights and claims to cover operating demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water (or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in our inability to maintain mineral extraction at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining operations and prevent us from pursuing expansion or any development opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting our operations.\nProcessing activities at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties require significant amounts of water. At the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, our ability to have sufficient water is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims. Water is provided for all of the mines comprising our Velarde\u00f1a Properties by wells located in the valley adjacent to the Velarde\u00f1a Properties. We hold title to three wells located near the sulfide plant and hold certificates of registration to three wells located near the oxide plant. We are licensed to pump water from all six wells up to a permitted amount. We are currently using water from the three wells associated with the oxide plant and from two of the three wells associated with the sulfide plant. We are required to make annual payments to the Mexican government to maintain our rights to these wells. We are required to pay a fine to the Mexican Government each year if we use too much water from a particular well or alternatively if we do not use a minimum amount of water from a particular well. In addition to these fines, the Mexican Government reserves the right to cancel our title to the wells for abuse of these rules.\nWe believe we currently have a sufficient amount of water for our expected processing activities at the plant. However, if we began processing material through both the sulfide and oxide plants in the future, we may face shortages in our water supply, and therefore will need to obtain water from outside sources at higher costs. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our wells, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights would require us to seek water from outside sources at higher costs and could require us to curtail or shut down mining and processing in the\nfuture. Laws and regulations may be introduced in the future which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in mining activities, thus adversely affecting our business.\nThe nature of mineral exploration, mining, and processing activities involves significant hazards, a high degree of risk, and the possibility of uninsured losses.\nExploration for and the production of minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization, and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined. While we are not currently conducting mining operations at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, we are evaluating a potential restart of mineral extraction. Because the Velarde\u00f1a mines are underground, potential mining activities, as well as the conduct of our exploration programs that frequently require rehabilitation of and drilling in underground mine workings, are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent in underground mines. Our operations are, and any future mining operations or construction we may conduct will be, subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and mining of mineral properties, such as, but not limited to:\n\u25cf Fluctuation in production costs that make mining uneconomic;\n\u25cf Labor disputes;\n\u25cf Unanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems;\n\u25cf Environmental hazards, noxious fumes and gases;\n\u25cf Water conditions;\n\u25cf Difficult surface or underground conditions;\n\u25cf Industrial accidents;\n\u25cf Metallurgical and other processing problems;\n\u25cf Mechanical and equipment performance problems;\n\u25cf Failure of pit walls, dams, declines, drifts and shafts;\n\u25cf Unusual or unexpected rock formations;\n\u25cf Personal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins, seismic activity and landslides; and\n\u25cf Decrease in the value of mineralized material due to lower gold, silver and metal prices.\nThese occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or processing facilities, equipment, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced extraction and processing and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although we maintain insurance against risks inherent in the conducting of our business in amounts that we consider reasonable, this insurance contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, and will not cover all potential risks associated with mining and exploration activities, and related liabilities might exceed policy limits. As a result of any or all of the forgoing, we could incur significant liabilities and costs that may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or that we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may also not be insured against all interruptions to our operations. Losses from these or other events may cause us to incur significant costs which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our properties. A significant loss could force us to reduce or suspend our operations and development.\nRisks related to our Exploration Activities\nOur properties are in the exploration stage.\nOur exploration properties may not contain mineral reserves.\nWe have not established that our properties contain any mineral reserve, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to do so. A mineral reserve is defined by the SEC in Regulation S-K 1300 as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The probability of an individual prospect ever having a \u201creserve\u201d that meets the requirements of Regulation S-K 1300 is extremely remote; in all probability our mineral properties do not contain any \u201creserves\u201d and any funds that we spend on exploration could be lost. Even if we do eventually discover mineral reserves on our properties, there can be no assurance that they can be developed into producing mines and we can extract those minerals. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few mineral properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.\nOur mineral resource estimates are inherently imprecise.\nWe have released estimates of mineral resources at the Rodeo project and the Velarde\u00f1a Properties. Mineral resource figures based on estimates made by geologists are inherently imprecise and depend on geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling that may prove to be unreliable or inaccurate. We cannot assure you that these estimates are accurate, and even if the estimates are accurate, the economic viability of the Velarde\u00f1a project may not justify exploitation, or in the case of Rodeo mine, the estimates may not accurately reflect the future revenue we receive from mineral extraction.\nThe exploration of our mineral properties is highly speculative in nature, involves substantial expenditures and is frequently non-productive.\nMineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and frequently results in no or very little return on amounts invested to evaluate a particular property. Substantial expenditures are required to (i) establish the existence of a potential ore body through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques; (ii) determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to process metal from the ore; (iii) determine the feasibility of mine development and mineral extraction; and (iv) construct, renovate or expand mining and processing facilities. If we discover a deposit or ore at a property, it usually takes several years from the initial phases of exploration until mineral extraction is possible, if at all. During this time, the economic feasibility of a project may change because of increased costs, lower metal prices or other factors. As a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs may not result in the identification of proven and probable mineral reserves in sufficient quantities to justify developing a particular property.\nWe may acquire additional mining properties and our business may be negatively impacted if reserves are not located on acquired properties or if we are unable to successfully execute and/or integrate the acquisitions.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, acquire additional mining properties. There can be no assurance that reserves will be identified on any properties that we acquire. We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we complete acquisitions of additional properties and reserves are not located on acquired properties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any acquisitions successfully, or that any acquisition will achieve anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock\nWe may not mine the Velarde\u00f1a Properties again.\nIn mid-November 2015, we shut down the mines and sulfide processing plant at our Velarde\u00f1a Properties and placed them on care and maintenance. Commencing mining again is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including: whether we are able to create a mine plan or gold recovery improvements that can achieve sustainable cash positive results\nat current and future metals prices; unexpected events, including difficulties in maintaining the properties on a care and maintenance basis, potential sabotage or damage to the assets related to the suspension of mining, and variations in ore grade and relative amounts, grades and metallurgical characteristics of oxide and sulfide ores; whether gold and silver prices will achieve or remain at sufficiently high levels to permit us to achieve sustainable cash positive results; whether actual holding and care and maintenance costs exceed current estimates or whether unanticipated costs arise; whether we are able to retain sufficient numbers of skilled mining and management personnel and otherwise maintain satisfactory relations with the unionized workforce on site; and our ability to obtain additional funding for general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities as currently conducted and possibly for a potential restart of our Velarde\u00f1a Properties. Based on these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that we will restart mining activities at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur operations are subject to ongoing permitting requirements which could result in the delay, suspension or termination of our operations.\nOur operations, including our ongoing exploration drilling programs and mining, require ongoing permits from governmental and local authorities. Future mining and current processing at our Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties and the continued evaluation of the El Quevar project and other exploration activities will require additional permits from various governmental authorities. We may also be required to obtain certain property rights to access or use our properties. Obtaining or renewing licenses and permits, and acquiring property rights, can be complex and time-consuming processes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire all required licenses, permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, and that such terms will not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or that the issuance of such licenses, permits or property rights will not be challenged by third parties. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits or if there is a delay in receiving future permits, our timetable and business plan will be adversely affected and may prevent or make future mining and processing at our Rodeo or Velarde\u00f1a properties and other continued processing activities economically unfeasible.\nOur exploration activities are in countries with developing economies and are subject to the risks of political and economic instability associated with these countries.\nWe currently conduct exploration activities almost exclusively in countries with developing economies, including Argentina and Mexico. These countries and other emerging markets in which we may conduct business have from time to time experienced economic or political instability. We may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with conducting exploration activities in countries with developing economies, including:\n\u25cfpolitical instability and violence;\n\u25cfwar and civil disturbance;\n\u25cfexpropriation or nationalization;\n\u25cfchanging fiscal, royalty and tax regimes;\n\u25cffluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cfhigh rates of inflation;\n\u25cfuncertain or changing legal requirements respecting the ownership and maintenance of mineral\nproperties, mines and mining activities, and inconsistent or arbitrary application of such legal\nrequirements;\n\u25cfuncertain or changing economic and environmental policies of governmental authorities in Mexico\nor Argentina;\n\u25cfunderdeveloped industrial and economic infrastructure;\n\u25cfcorruption; and\n\u25cfunenforceability of contractual rights.\nChanges in mining or investment policies or shifts in the prevailing political climate in any of the countries in which we conduct exploration activities could adversely affect our business.\nOur El Quevar exploration property is located in Argentina and is subject to various levels of political, economic, legal, social and other risks.\nOur El Quevar exploration property is located in Argentina and, as such, is exposed to various levels of political, economic, legal, social and other risks and uncertainties, including high interest rates; abrupt changes in currency values; high levels of inflation; stability and competitiveness of the Argentine peso against foreign currencies; wage and price controls; regulations to import equipment and other necessities relevant for operations; changes in governmental economic (including export duties and import regulations) or tax policies; and political and social tensions.\nThe Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in recent decades, characterized by periods of low or negative gross domestic product growth, high and variable levels of inflation and currency depreciation and devaluation. Financial and securities markets in Argentina, and the Argentine economy, are influenced by economic and market conditions in other markets worldwide. The Argentine government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the course of Argentina\u2019s economy, and taken other actions which do, or may be perceived to weaken the nation\u2019s economy especially as it relates to foreign investors and the overall investment climate.\nThe Argentine government has not only historically exercised significant influence over the country\u2019s economy, but the country\u2019s legal and regulatory frameworks have at times suffered radical changes due to political influence and significant political uncertainties as well. For example, in April 2014, there were nationwide strikes that paralyzed the Argentine economy, shutting down air, train and bus traffic, closing businesses and ports, emptying classrooms, shutting down non-emergency hospital attention and leaving trash uncollected. This is consistent with past periods of significant economic unrest and social and political turmoil. Future government policies to preempt, or in response to, social unrest may include expropriation, nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, suspension of the enforcement of creditors\u2019 rights, new taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and changes in laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment. Such policies could destabilize the country and adversely and materially affect the economy, and thereby our business.\nMost of our properties are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations which could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur exploration, mining, and processing operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment which control the exploration and mining of mineral properties and their effects on the environment, including air and water quality, mine reclamation, waste generation, handling and disposal, the protection of different species of flora and fauna and the preservation of lands. These laws and regulations require us to acquire permits and other authorizations for conducting certain activities. In many countries, there is relatively new comprehensive environmental legislation, and the permitting and the authorization processes may not be established or predictable. We may not be able to acquire necessary permits or authorizations on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in acquiring any permit or authorization could increase the cost of our projects and could suspend or delay the commencement of extraction and processing of mineralized material.\nOur Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties are subject to regulation by SEMARNAT, the environmental protection agency of Mexico. In order to permit new facilities at or expand existing facilities, regulations require that an environmental impact statement, known in Mexico as a Manifestaci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental (the \u201cManifestaci\u00f3n\u201d), be prepared by a third-party contractor for submission to SEMARNAT. Studies required to support the Manifestaci\u00f3n include a detailed analysis of soil, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The Manifestaci\u00f3n is then\npublished on SEMARNAT\u2019s web page and in its official gazette in a national and local newspaper. The Manifestaci\u00f3n is discussed at various open hearings, including hearings in the local communities, at which third parties may voice their views. We would be required to provide proof of local community support of the Manifestaci\u00f3n as a condition to final approval. We may not be able to obtain community support of future projects.\nEnvironmental legislation in Mexico and in many other countries is evolving in a manner which will likely require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Future changes in environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties are located may adversely affect our business, make our business prohibitively expensive, or prohibit it altogether. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations, as well as potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may (i) necessitate significant capital outlays, (ii) cause us to delay, terminate or otherwise change our intended activities with respect to one or more projects, or (iii) materially adversely affect our future exploration activities.\nMany of our properties are located in areas of prior mining activity and we may encounter legacy environmental damage.\nThe Velarde\u00f1a Properties and many of our exploration properties are located in historic mining districts where prior owners, including ECU in the case of the Velarde\u00f1a Properties, may have caused environmental damage that may not be known to us or to applicable regulators. At the Velarde\u00f1a Properties and in most other cases, we have not conducted comprehensive environmental analyses of our mineral properties. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and mining) is not generally available. To the extent environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we currently hold interests, or may hold interests in the future, that are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by us, or previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally, and to the extent we are subject to environmental requirements or liabilities, the cost of compliance with these requirements and satisfaction of these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to fully fund the cost of remediation of any environmental condition, we may be required to suspend activities or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remediation.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations could impact our business.\nWe are subject to physical risks associated with climate change which could seriously harm our results of operations and increase our costs and expenses. The occurrence of severe adverse weather conditions, including increased temperatures and droughts, fires, longer wet or dry seasons, increased precipitation, floods, hail, snow, or more severe storms, may have a potentially devastating impact on our operations. Adverse weather may result in physical damage to our operations, instability of our infrastructure and equipment, washed-out roads to our projects, and alter the supply of water and electricity to our properties, mining sites, and oxide plant. Increased temperatures may also decrease worker productivity at our projects and raise cooling costs. Should the impacts of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time in the areas in which we operate, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nChanges in the quantity of water, whether in excess or deficient amounts, may impact exploration and development activities, mining and processing operations, water storage and treatment facilities, tailings storage facilities, closure and reclamation efforts, and may increase levels of dust in dry conditions and land erosion and slope stability in case of prolonged wet conditions. Increased precipitation, extreme rainfall events or increased snowfall may potentially impact tailings storage facilities through flooding of the water management infrastructure, exceeding surface water runoff network capacity, overtopping the facility, or undermining the slope stability of the structure. Increased amounts of water may also result in extended periods of mine pit flooding, maintenance and storage facilities; or may exceed current water\ntreatment facility capacity to store and treat water physical conditions resulting in an unintended overflow either on or off of the mine site property.\nU.S. and international legislative and regulatory action intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing and evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Transitioning our business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations may cause us to incur lower economic returns than originally estimated for new exploration projects and development plans of existing operations.\nTitle to the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other properties and rights may be defective or may be challenged.\nOur policy is to seek to confirm the validity of our rights to, title to, or contract rights with respect to, each mineral property in which we have a material interest. However, we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance is not available for our mineral properties, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure rights to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. Accordingly, the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. In addition, we may be unable to conduct activities on our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties, and the title to our mineral properties may also be impacted by state action. We have not conducted surveys of all of the exploration properties in which we hold direct or indirect interests and, therefore, the precise area and location of these exploration properties may be in doubt.\nIn most of the countries in which we operate, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners. Any such loss, reduction or imposition of partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUnder the laws of Mexico, mineral resources belong to the state, and government concessions are required to explore for or exploit mineral reserves. Mineral rights derive from concessions granted, on a discretionary basis, by the Ministry of Economy, pursuant to the Mexican mining law and regulations thereunder. We hold title to the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and our other properties in Mexico through these government concessions, but there is no assurance that title to the concessions comprising the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and other properties will not be challenged or impaired. The Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties and other properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, interests or native land claims, and title may be affected by undetected defects. There could be valid challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties that, if successful, could impair mining with respect to such properties in the future. A defect could result in our losing all or a portion of our right, title, and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.\nOur Rodeo project mining concessions, Velarde\u00f1a Properties mining concessions and our other mining concessions in Mexico may be terminated if our obligations to maintain the concessions in good standing are not satisfied, including obligations to explore or exploit the relevant concession, to pay any relevant fees, to comply with all environmental and safety standards, to provide information to the Ministry of Economy and to allow inspections by the Ministry of Economy. In addition to termination, failure to make timely concession maintenance payments and otherwise comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in reduction or expropriation of entitlements. Additionally, in 2014, new mining concessions became subject to additional review and approval by the Mexico Ministry of Energy, and in recent years the federal government has been reluctant to issue new mining concessions at all.\nMining concessions in Mexico give exclusive exploration and exploitation rights to the minerals located in the concessions but do not include surface rights to the real property, which requires that we negotiate the necessary\nagreements with surface landowners. Many of our mining properties are subject to the Mexican ejido system requiring us to contract with the local communities surrounding the properties in order to obtain surface rights to land needed in connection with our mining exploration activities. In connection with our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, we have contracts with two ejidos to secure surface rights with a total annual cost of approximately $25,000. The first contract is a ten-year contract with the Velarde\u00f1a ejido, which provides surface rights to certain roads and other infrastructure at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties through 2021. The second contract is a 25-year contract with the Vista Hermosa ejido signed in March 2013, which provides exploration access and access rights for roads and utilities for our Velarde\u00f1a Properties. Similar to our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, the Rodeo project is subject to the Mexican ejido system. We believe, although we cannot be certain, that our agreement with the local ejidos to allow access to the property will be sufficient to conduct our proposed mining activities. We also have a separate surface rights agreement in place with a local private landowner that allows us to conduct mining operations on the two concessions that make up the Rodeo Property. Our inability to maintain and periodically renew or expand these surface rights on favorable terms or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMost of our mining properties, including our Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties, are located in Mexico and are subject to various levels of political, economic, legal, social and other risks.\nOur Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties are located in Mexico, and, as such, are exposed to various levels of political, economic, legal and other risks and uncertainties, including local acts of violence, such as violence from drug cartels; military repression; extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labor unrest; the risks of war or civil unrest; expropriation and nationalization; renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits and contracts; illegal mining; acts of political corruption; changes in taxation policies; restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation; and changing political conditions, currency controls and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nIn the past, Mexico has been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties, which have resulted in changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Mexico\u2019s status as a developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required funding for our Rodeo project, Velarde\u00f1a Properties or other projects in Mexico in the future.\nOur Mexican properties are subject to a variety of governmental regulations governing health and worker safety, employment standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development, protection of endangered and protected species, purchase, storage and use of explosives and other matters. Specifically, our activities related to the Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties are subject to regulation by SEMARNAT, the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Agua, which regulates water rights, and Mexican mining laws. Mexican regulators have broad authority to shut down and levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards.\nOur Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties and mineral exploration activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to our mining and exploration activities or the maintenance of our properties.\nChanges, if any, in mining or investment policies, changes or increases in the legal rights of indigenous populations or in the difficulty or expense of obtaining rights from them that are necessary for our Rodeo or Velarde\u00f1a properties or shifts in political attitude may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Our mining and exploration activities may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to restrictions on extraction, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, income and other taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety. Restart of mining or use of both the oxide and sulfide plant may also require us to assure the availability of adequate supplies of water and power, which could be affected by government policy and competing businesses in the area. The\noccurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our mining and exploration activities and financial condition.\nFuture changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could negatively impact current or planned exploration or mining activities at our Rodeo or Velarde\u00f1a properties or in respect of any of our other projects in Mexico or projects with which we become involved in Mexico. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption of mining and exploration or material fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nOur ability to develop our Mexican properties is subject to the rights of the Ejido (agrarian cooperatives) who use or own the surface for agricultural purposes.\nOur ability to mine minerals is subject to maintaining satisfactory arrangements and relationships with the Ejido for access and surface disturbances. Ejidos are groups of local inhabitants who were granted rights to conduct agricultural activities on the property. We must negotiate and maintain a satisfactory arrangement with these residents in order to disturb or discontinue their rights to farm.\nIn connection with our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, we have contracts with two ejidos to secure surface rights with a total annual cost of approximately $25,000. The first contract is a ten-year contract with the Velarde\u00f1a ejido, which provides surface rights to certain roads and other infrastructure at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties through 2021and is currently being renewed for an additional 10-year period. The second contract is a 25-year contract with the Vista Hermosa ejido signed in March 2013, which provides exploration access and access rights for roads and utilities for our Velarde\u00f1a Properties. Similar to our Velarde\u00f1a Properties, the Rodeo project is subject to the Mexican ejido system. We also have a separate surface rights agreement in place with a local private landowner that allows us to conduct mining operations on the two concessions that make up the Rodeo Property. Our inability to maintain and periodically renew or expand these surface rights on favorable terms or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMost of our costs are subject to exchange control policies, the effects of inflation, and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso.\nOur revenue and external funding are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, certain mining, processing, maintenance and exploration costs at the Rodeo and Velarde\u00f1a properties and most of our exploration properties are denominated in Mexican pesos. These costs principally include electricity, labor, water, maintenance, local contractors and fuel. The appreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in U.S. dollar terms in Mexico, which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Conversely, depreciation of the Mexican peso decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in U.S. dollar terms. When inflation in Mexico increases without a corresponding devaluation of the Mexican peso, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. The annual average inflation rate in Mexico was approximately 7.3% in 2021, 3.2% in 2020, and 3.6% in 2019. At the same time, the peso has been subject to fluctuation, which may not have been proportionate to the inflation rate and may not be proportionate to the inflation rate in the future. The value of the peso decreased by 2.6% in 2021, decreased by 4.7% in 2020, and increased by 3.6% in 2019. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our financial results. There can be no assurance that the Mexican government will maintain its current policies with regard to the peso or that the peso's value will not fluctuate significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that currency fluctuations, inflation and exchange control policies will not have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, earnings and cash flows.\nLack of infrastructure could forestall or prevent further exploration and advancement.\nExploration activities, as well as any advancement activities, depend on adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are important factors that affect capital and operating costs and the feasibility and economic viability of a project. Unanticipated or higher than expected costs and unusual or infrequent weather phenomena,\nor government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our Common Stock\nOne of our stockholders owns a significant percentage of our common stock and could block decisions or transactions that could be beneficial to other stockholders.\nOne of our stockholders, The Sentient Group, through the Sentient executive funds (\u201cSentient\u201d), owns approximately 23% of our outstanding common stock. With this level of ownership, Sentient could exert significant control over us, including over the election of directors, changes in the size or the composition of the board of directors, and mergers and other business combinations involving us. Through greater control of the board of directors and increased voting power, including the potential to prevent a quorum at stockholders meetings, Sentient could control certain decisions, including decisions regarding qualification and appointment of officers, operations of the business including acquisition or disposition of our assets or purchases and sales of mining or exploration properties, dividend policy, and access to capital (including borrowing from third-party lenders and the issuance of equity or debt securities). Sentient\u2019s large share ownership will also make it difficult, if not impossible, for us to enter into a change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial for our other shareholders.\nThe existence of a significant number of warrants may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 10.8 million warrants outstanding with a weighted average exercise price per share of $0.35. The existence of securities available for exercise and resale is referred to as an \u201coverhang,\u201d and, particularly if the warrants are \"in the money,\" the anticipation of potential sales could exert downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nFailure to meet the maintenance criteria of the NYSE American may result in the delisting of our common stock, which could result in lower trading volumes and liquidity, lower prices of our common shares and make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain that listing, we must meet certain requirements, including g maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American; or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nOn August 19, 2019, we received written notification (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the NYSE American that were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d). We are required to report a stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million or more if we have reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. The Notice noted that we reported a stockholders\u2019 equity of $4,380,000 as of June 30, 2019 and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in each of its five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2018. As a result, we became subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide and were required to submit a plan of compliance by September 18, 2019 to the NYSE American addressing how we intended to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide by February 19, 2021. On January 14,\n2021, we received notice from the NYSE American that we had resolved the continued listing deficiency with respect to Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide and had regained compliance with all of the NYSE American continued listing requirements.\nIf we are unable to remain in compliance with the NYSE American continued listing requirements, our common stock may be suspended from trading on and/or delisted from the NYSE American. Although we have not been notified of any delisting proceedings, there is no assurance that we will not receive such notice in the future or that we will be able to then comply with NYSE American listing standards. If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations. In particular, if we are delisted from the NYSE American, we will be unable to sell our common stock pursuant to the ATM Program.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer could find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing on the NYSE American, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. These factors could significantly negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital.\nGeneral Risks\nOur operations may be further disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe novel strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, poses a risk to our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend exploration activities and/or development projects which may impact liquidity and financial results. These restrictions have significantly disrupted economic activity in the world, national and local economies and have caused volatility in capital markets. For example, in compliance with a directive of the Mexican Federal Government to suspend all non-essential activities, including mining, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended processing activities at the Velarde\u00f1a Properties in the State of Durango, Mexico, during portions of April and May 2020. If the Mexican Federal Government were to resuspend non-essential activities, including mining, this may significantly lower the revenue we expect to receive from production at our Rodeo Property. The various government restrictions arising due to the virus have curtailed the travel of our executives, which might adversely affect our operations on a long-term basis. The effects of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 and related government responses have caused and could continue to cause disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and productivity and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on us, including reduced demand for our products, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets and impairment of our ability to develop and construct new mines and operate existing projects and to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets. In particular, these effects could disrupt or delay mining at our operating projects, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flow and financial condition. Due to circumstances beyond our control, including\nthe availability and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, we are unable to determine the long-term impact that the COVID-19 outbreak will have on operations.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to our operations, indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness.\nWe depend upon the services of a number of key executives and management personnel. These individuals include our executive officers and other key employees. If any of these individuals were to die, become disabled or leave our company, we would be forced to identify and retain individuals to replace them. We may be unable to hire a suitable replacement on favorable terms should that become necessary.\nOur success is also dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to execute on our strategy. There continues to be competition over highly skilled personnel in our industry. If we lose key personnel or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 related laws and policies could make hiring and retaining highly skilled key employees more difficult in the future.\nOur business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience periods where our employees are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced temporary workforce disruptions and periods where we temporarily placed certain sites in care and maintenance. These events, or if similar events occur in the future, could have a material adverse impact on the business in the future.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, which are subject to certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our business. Any significant breakdown, invasion, virus, cyber attack, security breach, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact our business. To the extent any invasion, cyber attack or security breach results in disruption to our business, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks, we may suffer such losses in the future. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures. We also may be subject to significant litigation, regulatory investigation and remediation costs associated with any information security vulnerabilities, cyber attacks or security breaches.", "PERMNO": 93285, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "AUMN"}
