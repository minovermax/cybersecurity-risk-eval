RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Note on Forward Looking Statements\nIn addition to the other information in this annual report the factors listed below should be considered in evaluating our business and prospects. This annual report contains a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere herein, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. In this report, the words \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cfuture\u201d and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned to consider the specific factors described below and not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements, to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date hereof.\nFinancial Risks\nWe May Not be Able to Continue as a Going Concern. We have incurred significant historical losses and negative cash flow from operations and have an accumulated deficit of $82.8 million at March 31, 2016. Other than cash on hand, we have no other sources of financing currently available as of March 31, 2016. We may incur additional losses in the future until licensing or other revenues are sufficient to sustain continued profitability. Until we can demonstrate sustained profitability, our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and may be dependent upon obtaining additional financing. There is no assurance that we will be successful in generating or raising funds, if necessary, to sustain its operations for twelve months or beyond. Should we be unable to generate funds or obtain required financing, we may have to curtail operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Uncertainty as to the outcome of these factors raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe Have Not Achieved Consistent Profitability and May Incur Future Losses. We have recently experienced losses and profitable periods have been sporadic as revenues vary significantly between periods as a result of license activity. Historically we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations and we have an accumulated deficit of $82.8 million at March 31, 2016. Previous historical profitable years have been the result of one-time patent licensing revenues and there is no assurance of future licensing revenues from new licensees. Accordingly, we could continue to incur losses in the future until licensing revenues are sufficient to sustain continued profitability. Failure to achieve and maintain profitability will likely negatively impact the value of our securities.\nOur licensing and enforcement cycle is lengthy and costly, and our sales and legal efforts may be unsuccessful. We incur significant administrative, research and legal expenses prior to entering into license agreements and generating license revenues. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins. We most often need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial and the outcomes are unpredictable.\nIf We Encounter Unforeseen Difficulties and Cannot Obtain any Required Additional Funding on Favorable Terms, Our Business May Suffer. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents on hand totaled $701,481 at March 31, 2016. In recent periods we have relied primarily on service revenues and payments from licensees to generate the funds needed to finance our operations. We do not expect future service revenues due to the discontinuance of our eVU business. If we continue to incur losses in future periods or we encounter unforeseen difficulties in the future, including difficulties arising as a result of the outside influences identified below, we may deplete our capital resources. As a result, we may be required to obtain additional financing in the future through debt or equity financings or otherwise. If we are required to raise additional capital in the future, such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain additional capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Expect Our Operating Results to Fluctuate Significantly. Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. This fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 Uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of any future patent licensing revenues\n\u00b7 Changes in research and development costs\n\u00b7 Changes in general economic conditions\n\u00b7 Changes in technology\nWe do not Anticipate Paying Dividends. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. An investment in our common stock, therefore, may be more suitable for an investor that is seeking capital appreciation rather than current yield and, as a consequence, may be more speculative. Accordingly, investors should not purchase our common stock with an expectation of receiving regular dividends.\nRisks Related to our Patent Licensing and Enforcement Strategy\nWe Face Uncertain Revenue Prospects from our Patent Enforcement Strategy. Our current intellectual property portfolios have not been thoroughly tested in court and there is no assurance we can prevail in any current or future patent enforcement. Future court rulings or rulings from any reexamination of patent claims by the USPTO could have a significant positive or negative impact on future licensing activity. The licensing demand for our patent portfolio is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which target infringers agree to pay royalties or settle future enforcement actions, if any. There can be no assurance of future revenues from our strategy of enforcing our patent portfolio. Due to the nature of our licensing business and uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of the receipt of future license fees, if any, from potential infringers, stemming primarily from uncertainties regarding the outcome of enforcement actions, rates of adoption of our patented technologies, the growth rates of our prospective licensees and other factors, our revenues may vary significantly in the future, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, cause our quarterly and annual results to be below market expectations and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Fee Arrangement with Patent Enforcement Counsel Subjects Us to Certain Risks and Substantial Costs and Fees and Could Limit Our Net Proceeds From Any Successful Patent Enforcement Actions. Our agreement for legal services and partial contingent fee arrangement with Handal and Associates provides that Handal is our legal counsel in connection with the assertion of our Nunchi patents and microSignet patents against infringers. Handal is advancing certain costs and expenses including travel expenses and court costs. We have agreed to pay Handal a monthly retainer fee of $30,000 and a fee ranging from 33-40% of any license or litigation recovery related to patent enforcement matters, less prior retainers and expenses. We are not in control of the timing, costs and fees, which could be substantial and we could be required to pay substantial litigation support costs without any recovery. Costs and fees paid by Handal could also limit our share of proceeds, if any, from future patent enforcement actions. There can be no assurance Handal will diligently and timely pursue patent enforcement actions on our behalf.\nNew Legislation, Regulations or Rules Related to Obtaining or Enforcing Patents Could Make Our Patent Enforcement More Difficult, Significantly Increase Our Operating Costs and Decrease Our Revenues. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented by Congress, the USPTO or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, such changes could negatively affect our business by making our patent enforcement efforts more difficult, costly and decrease opportunities for future revenues. Recently, United States patent laws were amended with the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which took effect on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual allegedly-infringing parties by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the America Invents Act enacted a new inter-partes review process at the USPTO which can be, and often is, used by defendants, and other individuals and entities, to separately challenge the validity of any patent. At this time, it is not clear what, if any, overall impact the America Invents Act will have on the operation of our enforcement business. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies. Also, in 2014, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, initiated a study under Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act to evaluate the patent assertion practice and market impact of Patent Assertion Entities, or PAEs. It is expected that the results of the PAE study by the FTC will be provided to Congress and other agencies, such as the DOJ, who could take action, including legislative proposals, based on the results of the study.\nFinally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions. In addition, recent federal court decisions have lowered the threshold for obtaining attorneys\u2019 fees in patent infringement cases and increased the level of deference given to a district court\u2019s fee-shifting determination. These decisions may make it easier for district courts to shift a prevailing party\u2019s attorneys' fees to a non-prevailing party if the district court believes that the case was weak or conducted in an abusive manner. As a result, defendants in patent infringement actions may elect not to settle because these decisions make it much easier for defendants to get attorneys\u2019 fees.\nChanges in patent law could adversely impact our business. Patent laws may continue to change, and may alter the historically consistent protections afforded to owners of patent rights. Such changes may not be advantageous for us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents against infringing parties. Increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes which increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions. For instance, the United States Congress is considering a bill that would require, among other things, non-practicing entities that bring patent infringement lawsuits to pay legal costs of the defendants, if the lawsuits are unsuccessful and certain standards are not met.\nShould Litigation Be Required to Enforce Our Patents, Trial Judges and Juries Often Find It Difficult to Understand Complex Patent Enforcement Litigation, and as a Result, We May Need to Appeal Adverse Decisions By Lower Courts In Order to Successfully Enforce Our Patents. It is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies, and as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed revenue. Although we intend to diligently pursue enforcement litigation if necessary to monetize our patents, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries and trial courts.\nFederal Courts are Becoming More Crowded, and as a Result, Patent Enforcement Litigation is Taking Longer. Any patent enforcement actions we may be required to take to monetize our patents will most likely be prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear patent enforcement actions also hear other cases that may take priority over any actions we may take. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete any enforcement actions.\nAs Patent Enforcement Litigation Becomes More Prevalent, It May Become More Difficult for Us to Voluntarily License Our Patents. We believe that the more prevalent patent enforcement actions become, the more difficult it will be for us to voluntarily license our patents to major technology firms as they may increasingly become more reluctant to settle and license. As a result, we may need to increase the number of our patent enforcement actions and/or expend additional resources on enforcement actions to cause infringing companies to license our patents or pay damages for lost royalties. This may increase the risks associated with an investment in our Company.\nIn Connection With Patent Enforcement Actions That We May Conduct, a Court May Rule That We Have\nViolated Certain Statutory, Regulatory, Federal, Local or Governing Rules or Standards, Which May Expose Us\nTo Certain Material Liabilities. In connection with any of our patent enforcement actions, it is possible that a defendant may request and/or a court may rule that we have violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. In such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against us or award attorney\u2019s fees and/or expenses to a defendant(s), which could be material, and if we are required to pay such monetary sanctions, attorneys\u2019 fees and/or expenses, such payment could materially harm our operating results and our financial position.\nRisks Related to Operations\nIf We Lose Key Personnel or Are Unable to Attract and Retain Additional Highly Skilled Personnel Required For the Expansion of Our Activities Our Business Will Suffer. Our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our key technical, sales and senior management personnel and their ability to execute our strategy. The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or certain other key employees or our intellectual property consultant may harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees and consultants. Competition for employees in our industry is intense. We may be unable to retain our key employees or to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Government Regulation\nFailing to Protect Our Proprietary Rights to Our Technology Could Harm Our Ability to Compete, as well as Our Results of Our Operations. Our success and ability to compete substantially depends on our internally developed software, technologies and trademarks, which we protect through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws. Patent applications or trademark registrations may not be approved. Even when they are approved, our patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated. If our trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own such trademarks, our use of these trademarks would be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with the third-party owners, which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic and industry partners, and generally control access to and distribution of our software, technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our solutions or technologies. The steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We have licensed, and we may license in the future, certain proprietary rights to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our business partners maintain the quality of our brand, they may take actions that could impair the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation. In addition, these business partners may not take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies.\nWe May Face Intellectual Property Infringement Claims That May Be Difficult to Defend and Costly to Resolve, Which Could Harm Our Business. Although we do not believe we infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert such claims against us in the future or that such claims will not be successful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources to defend any claims relating to proprietary rights, which could harm our business. In addition, we are obligated under certain agreements to indemnify the other party for claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. If we are required to indemnify parties under these agreements, our business could be harmed. If someone asserts a claim relating to proprietary technology or information against us, we may seek licenses to this intellectual property. We may not be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights may harm our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation, Content and Intellectual Property Government Regulation May Subject Us to Liability and Require Us to Change the Way We Do Business. Our business is subject to rapidly changing laws and regulations. Although our operations are currently based in California, the United States government and the governments of other states and foreign countries have attempted to regulate activities on the Internet. Evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business include privacy law, copyright law, proposed encryption laws, content regulation and import/export regulations. Because of this rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory environment, we cannot predict how these laws and regulations might affect our business. In addition, these uncertainties make it difficult to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing the Internet. These laws and regulations could harm us by subjecting us to liability or forcing us to change how we do business.\nRisks Related to Trading in Our Common Stock\nOur Disclosure Controls and Procedures May Not Prevent or Detect All Acts of Fraud. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Our management expects that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nFailure to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Could Harm Stockholder and Business Confidence In Our Financial Reporting, Our Ability to Obtain Financing and Other Aspects of Our Business. Maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC require us to include in our Form 10-K a report by management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the respective fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. While our management has concluded that we did not have any material weaknesses as of March 31, 2016, material weaknesses have been identified in prior years and it is possible that material weaknesses will be identified in the future. In addition, components of our internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time. If management is unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s stock price.\nEvolving Regulation of Corporate Governance and Public Disclosure May Result In Additional Expenses and Continuing Uncertainty. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, conversion to International Financial Reporting Standards, XBRL interactive SEC filings, and new SEC regulations are creating uncertainty for public companies. We continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nWe are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and we may be harmed.\nInvesting in a Technology Stock (Such as Ours) May Involve Greater Risk Than Other Investments Due to Market Conditions, Stock Price Volatility and Other Factors. The trading price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations to date, and will likely be subject to wide fluctuations in the future due to:\n\u00b7 Quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results\n\u00b7 Announcements of technological innovations by us, our customers or competitors\n\u00b7 New innovations or achievements by us or our competitors\n\u00b7 The legal and regulatory environment for patent enforcement actions\n\u00b7 General financial market conditions\n\u00b7 Market conditions for technology stocks\n\u00b7 Litigation or changes in operating results or estimates by analysts or others\n\u00b7 Other events or factors\nIn addition, potential dilutive effects of future sales of shares of common stock by stockholders and by the Company and subsequent sale of common stock by the holders of options could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.\nWe do not endorse and accept any responsibility for the estimates or recommendations issued by stock research analysts or others from time to time or comments on any electronic chat boards. The public stock markets in general, and technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many high technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future.\nLow-Price Stocks and Stocks Traded on the OTCQB Marketplace are Subject to Special Regulations and may have Increased Risk. Our shares of common stock are traded on the OTCQB Marketplace, an electronic, screen-based trading system operated by OTC Markets Group. Securities traded on the OTCQB are, for the most part, thinly traded and are subject to special regulations not imposed on securities listed or traded on the NASDAQ system or on a national securities exchange. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of, our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our outstanding common stock in the public market could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. To date, the price of our common stock has been extremely volatile with the sale price fluctuating from a low of $0.0351 to a high of $0.1149 in the last fiscal year. In addition, our common stock is subject to Rules 15g-1-15g-6 promulgated under the Exchange Act that imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally, a person with assets in excess of $1,000,000, excluding the value of such person\u2019s primary residence, or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with his or her spouse). For transactions covered by this rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company\u2019s securities and may affect the ability of investors to sell their securities in the secondary market. The SEC has also adopted regulations which define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the regulations require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nImportant Factors Related to Forward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks. This prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act and we intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. These forward-looking statements include our plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to the products and our future economic performance. The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions that competitive conditions within the computer and technology markets will not change materially or adversely, that the computer and technology markets will continue to experience growth, that demand for our technologies will increase, that we will obtain and/or retain existing development partners and key management personnel, that our forecasts will accurately anticipate market demand and that there will be no material adverse change in our operations or business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect, among other things, to future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in forward-looking information will be realized. In addition, as disclosed above, our business and operations are subject to substantial risks which increase the uncertainty inherent in such forward-looking statements. Any of the other factors disclosed above could cause our net sales or net income (or loss), or our growth in net sales or net income (or loss), to differ materially from prior results. Growth in absolute amounts of costs of sales and selling and administrative expenses or the occurrence of extraordinary events could cause actual results to vary materially from the results contemplated in the forward-looking statements. Budgeting and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments, the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing, capital expenditure or other budgets, which may in turn affect our results of operations. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.", "PERMNO": 79099, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "EDIG"}
