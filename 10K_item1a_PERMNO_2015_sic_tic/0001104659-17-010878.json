{"cik": "103145", "company": "VEECO INSTRUMENTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nKey Risk Factors That May Impact Future Results\nStockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and stock price.\nUnfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our operating results.\nConditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile and have deteriorated significantly in many of the countries and regions in which we do business and may remain or become further depressed in the future. We have experienced and may continue to experience customer rescheduling and, to a lesser extent, cancellations of orders for our products. Adverse market conditions relative to our products could result in:\n\u00b7 reduced demand for our products;\n\u00b7 rescheduling and cancellations of orders for our products, resulting in negative backlog adjustments;\n\u00b7 increased price competition leading to lower margin for our products;\n\u00b7 increased competition from sellers of used equipment or lower-priced alternatives to our products;\n\u00b7 increased inventory obsolescence;\n\u00b7 increased uncollectable amounts due from our customers resulting in increased reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 disruptions in our supply chain as we reduce our purchasing volumes and limit our contract manufacturing operations; and\n\u00b7 higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.\nIf the markets in which we participate fail to experience a recovery or experience a further downturn, this could have a further negative impact on our sales and revenue generation, margins and operating expenses, and profitability.\nA reduction or elimination of foreign government subsidies and economic incentives may adversely affect the future order rate for our MOCVD equipment.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue in China. In recent years, the Chinese government has provided various incentives to encourage development of the LED industry, including subsidizing a significant portion of the purchase cost of MOCVD equipment. These subsidies have enabled and encouraged certain customers in this region to purchase more of our MOCVD equipment than these customers might have purchased without these subsidies. The availability of these subsidies has varied over time and may end at some point in the future. A reduction or elimination of these incentives may result in a reduction in future orders for our MOCVD equipment in this region, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, in an effort to promote Chinese competition, the Chinese government could impose restrictions on the receipt of these subsidies, including requirements that the purchased equipment be sourced locally.\nA related risk is that many customers use or had planned to use Chinese government subsidies, in addition to other incentives from the Chinese government, to build new manufacturing facilities or to expand existing manufacturing facilities. Delays in the start-up of these facilities or the cancellation of construction plans altogether, together with other related issues pertaining to customer readiness, could adversely impact the timing of our revenue recognition, could result in order cancellations, a reduction in order backlog, and could have other negative effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe cyclicality of the industries we serve directly affects our business.\nOur business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers in the LED, mobile communication, data storage, and other device markets. We are subject to the business cycles of these industries, the timing, length, and volatility of which are difficult to predict. These industries have historically been highly cyclical and have experienced significant economic downturns in the last decade. As a capital equipment provider, our revenue depends in large part on the spending patterns of these customers, who often delay expenditures or cancel or reschedule orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions. In downturns, we must be able to quickly and effectively align our costs with prevailing market conditions, as well as motivate and retain key employees. However, because a portion of our costs are fixed, our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue shortfalls may be limited. Downturns in one or more of these industries have had and will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Alternatively, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to acquire and/or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand and attract, hire, assimilate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified people. We cannot give assurances that our net sales and operating results will not be adversely affected if our customers experience economic downturns or slowdowns in their businesses.\nWe operate in industries characterized by rapid technological change.\nEach of the industries in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to enhance existing products and develop and manufacture new products in a timely and cost effective manner and to accurately predict technology transitions. Because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales, we must anticipate the future demand for products when selecting which development programs to fund and pursue. Our financial results depend to a great extent on the successful introduction of several new products, many of which require achieving increasingly stringent technical specifications. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting, developing, manufacturing, and marketing new products or new technologies or in enhancing existing products. Our performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately predict evolving market trends and related customer needs and to effectively allocate our resources among new and existing products and technologies.\nWe are also exposed to potential risks associated with unexpected product performance issues. Our product designs and manufacturing processes are complex and could contain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced. Unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs and damages, including increased service and warranty expenses, the need to provide product replacements or modifications, reimbursement for damages caused by our products, product recalls, related litigation, and product write-offs and disposal costs. These costs could be\nsubstantial and our reputation could be harmed, resulting in reduced demand for our products and could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have a concentrated customer base, located primarily in a limited number of regions, which operate in highly concentrated industries.\nOur customer base continues to be highly concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for, and likely will continue to account for, a substantial portion of our net sales, which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to us. Our five largest customers accounted for 39% of our total net sales in 2016. Customer consolidation activity involving some of our largest customers could result in an even greater concentration of our sales in the future. Management changes at key customer accounts could result in a loss of future sales due to vendor preferences or other reasons and may introduce new challenges in managing customer relationships.\nIf a principal customer discontinues its relationship with us or suffers economic setbacks, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers. We cannot be certain that we will be able to do so. In addition, because a relatively small number of large manufacturers, many of whom are our customers, dominate the industries in which they operate, it may be especially difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business. A significant portion of orders in our backlog are orders from our principal customers.\nIn addition, a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line. As a result, once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor\u2019s capital equipment, we believe that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor. Accordingly, if a customer selects a competitor\u2019s product over ours, we could experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time.\nFurthermore, we do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales, and we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each new order we attempt to obtain. Our failure to obtain new sales orders from new or existing customers would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur customer base is also highly concentrated in terms of geography, and the majority of our sales are to customers located in a limited number of countries. In 2016, 26% of our total net sales were to customers located in China. Dependence upon sales emanating from a limited number of regions increases our risk of exposure to local difficulties and challenges, such as those associated with regional economic downturns, political instability, fluctuating currency exchange rates, natural disasters, social unrest, pandemics, terrorism, or acts of war. Our reliance upon customer demand arising primarily from a limited number of countries could materially adversely impact our future results of operations.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing resources than us. Other competitors are located in regions with lower labor costs and other reduced costs of operation. In addition, our ability to compete in foreign countries against local manufacturers may be hampered by nationalism, social attitudes, laws, regulations, and policies within such countries that favor local companies over U.S. companies or that are otherwise designed to promote the development and growth of local competitors. Furthermore, we face competition from smaller emerging equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services we offer, with a focused approach on innovative technology for specialized markets. New product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing or prior generation products. Increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business.\nTo remain competitive, we may enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers, and other third parties to explore new market opportunities and possible technological advancements. These alliances may require significant investments of capital and other resources and often involve the exchange of sensitive confidential information. The success of these\nalliances may depend on factors over which we have limited control and will likely require ongoing cooperation and good faith efforts from our strategic partners. Strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe timing of our orders, shipments, and revenue recognition may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high-priced systems. As a result, the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material effect on our sales and operating results for a particular fiscal period. As is typical in our industry, orders, shipments, and customer acceptances often occur during the last few weeks of a quarter. As a result, a delay of only a week or two can impact which period revenue is reported in and can cause volatility in our revenue for a given reporting period. Our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect this trend to continue. If our orders, shipments, net sales, or operating results in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur sales cycle is long and unpredictable.\nHistorically, we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles (the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer). Our sales cycle can exceed twelve months. The timing of an order often depends on the capital expenditure budget cycle of our customers, which is completely out of our control. In addition, the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications typically ranges from three to six months. When coupled with the fluctuating amount of time required for shipment, installation, and final acceptance, our sales cycles often vary widely, and variations in length of this period can cause further fluctuations in our operating results. As a result of our lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research, development, selling, general, and/or administrative expenses before we generate revenues for these products. We may never generate the anticipated revenues if a customer cancels or changes plans. Variations in the length of our sales cycle could also cause our sales and, therefore, our cash flow and results of operations to fluctuate widely from period to period.\nOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification which could result in decreased sales, increased inventory obsolescence, and/or liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed.\nCustomer purchase orders may be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer, sometimes with limited or no penalties, which may result in increased and/or unrecoverable costs for the Company. We adjust our backlog for such cancellations, contract modifications, and delivery delays that result in a delivery period in excess of one year, among other items. A downturn in one or more of our businesses could result in increases in order cancellations and/or postponements.\nWe write-off excess and obsolete inventory based on historical trends, future usage forecasts, and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the write-off required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. In addition, we place orders with our suppliers based on our customers\u2019 orders. If our customers cancel their orders with us, we may not be able to cancel our orders with our suppliers or may be required to take a charge for these cancelled commitments to our suppliers. Any such charges could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in inventory obsolescence, liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed, and/or manufacturing interruptions or delays which could affect our ability to meet customer demand.\nOur business depends on our ability to accurately forecast and supply equipment, services, and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components, and subassemblies (collectively, \u201cparts\u201d) from suppliers. Uncertain worldwide economic conditions and market instabilities make it difficult for us (and our customers and our suppliers) to accurately forecast future product demand. If actual demand for our products is different than expected, we may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing, or expediting delivery of parts. If we overestimate the demand for our products,\nexcess inventory could result, which could be subject to heavy price discounting, which could become obsolete, and/or which could subject us to liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed. Similarly, we may be harmed in the event that our competitors overestimate the demand for their products and engage in heavy price discounting practices as a result. In addition, the volatility of demand for capital equipment increases capital, technical, and other risks for companies in our supply chain.\nFurthermore, some key parts may be subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the United States. We may experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs, or customer order cancellations as a result of:\n\u00b7 the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts;\n\u00b7 volatility in the availability and cost of materials;\n\u00b7 difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\n\u00b7 information technology or infrastructure failures;\n\u00b7 natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, or storms); or\n\u00b7 other causes (such as regional economic downturns, pandemics, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) that could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies, increased costs, or order cancellations.\nIn addition, in the event of an unanticipated increase in demand for our products, our need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity may be limited by working capital constraints of our suppliers and may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully manage our outsourcing activities or failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as anticipated could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to adapt to fluctuating order volumes.\nTo better align our costs with market conditions, increase the percentage of variable costs relative to total costs, and to increase productivity and operational efficiency, we have outsourced certain functions to third parties, including the manufacture of our MOCVD systems. We rely heavily on our outsourcing partners to perform their contracted functions to allow us the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions, including periods of significantly diminished order volumes. If our outsourcing partners do not perform as required, or if our outsourcing model does not allow us to realize the intended cost savings and flexibility, our results of operations (and those of our third party providers) may be adversely affected. Disputes and possibly litigation involving third party providers could result, and we could suffer damage to our reputation. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing may also adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market. Although we attempt to select reputable providers, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect. In addition, the role of third party providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and adopt new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers in order to realize operational efficiencies, assure quality, and protect our intellectual property. If we do not effectively manage our outsourcing strategy or if third party providers do not perform as anticipated, we may not realize the benefits of productivity improvements, and we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, manufacturing and/or installation interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of our supply chain, loss of intellectual property rights, quality issues, increased product time-to-market and/or inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, some of whom are our sole source for particular components.\nWe currently outsource certain functions to third parties, including the manufacture of our MOCVD systems. We rely on a small number of suppliers for the manufacturing of these systems. While we maintain some level of internal manufacturing capability for these systems, the failure of our suppliers to meet their contractual obligations under our supply arrangements and our inability to make alternative arrangements or resume the manufacture of these systems\nourselves could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with our customers and/or our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, certain of the components and sub-assemblies included in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our inability to develop alternative sources, if necessary, could result in a prolonged interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of one or more components, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees, including those in executive, managerial, engineering, and marketing positions, as well as highly skilled and qualified technical personnel and personnel to implement and monitor our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems. Attracting, retaining, and motivating such qualified personnel may be difficult due to challenging industry conditions, competition for such personnel by other technology companies, consolidations and relocations of operations, and workforce reductions, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting or retaining key personnel. We have entered into employment agreements with certain key personnel but our inability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur acquisition strategy subjects us to risks associated with evaluating and pursuing these opportunities and integrating these businesses.\nWe have completed several significant acquisitions in the past, and we will consider acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 difficulties and increased costs in integrating the personnel, operations, technologies, and products of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention while evaluating, pursuing, and integrating the business to be acquired;\n\u00b7 the inability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated, resulting in obligations to pay professional and other expenses, including any applicable termination fees;\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, especially if a relocation or change in responsibilities is involved;\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations in a cost-effective manner;\n\u00b7 the unattainability of expected synergies;\n\u00b7 unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities;\n\u00b7 increased amortization expense relating to intangible assets; and\n\u00b7 other adverse effects on our business, including the potential impairment and write-down of amounts capitalized as intangible assets and goodwill as part of the acquisition, as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company.\nOur inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition, the ownership percentage of our then-current shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by these shareholders could be diluted, which could adversely affect the price of our stock. If we use cash to pay for an acquisition, the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or other purposes.\nTiming of market adoption of LED technology for general lighting is uncertain.\nOur future business prospects depend largely on the market adoption of products that incorporate our technologies. Potential barriers to such adoption include higher initial costs and customer familiarity with, and substantial investment\nand know-how in, existing technologies. These barriers apply to the adoption of LED technology for general illumination applications, including residential, commercial, and street lighting markets. While the use of LED technology for general lighting has grown in recent years, challenges remain and widespread adoption (and the related demand for our products) may not occur at currently projected rates. Furthermore, the adoption of, or changes in, government policies that discourage the use of traditional lighting technologies may impact LED adoption.\nOur sales to manufacturers are highly dependent on sales of consumer electronics applications, which can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors and materially adversely impact our future results of operations.\nThe demand for LEDs, HDDs, and our other products is highly dependent on sales of consumer electronics, such as televisions and computer monitors, computers, tablets, digital video recorders, smartphones, cell phones, and other mobile devices. Manufacturers of LEDs are among our largest customers and account for a substantial portion of our revenue. Factors that could influence the levels of spending on consumer electronic products include consumer confidence, access to credit, volatility in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers\u2019 products and, in turn, on our customers\u2019 demand for our products and services impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, manufacturers of LEDs have in the past overestimated their potential for market share growth. If this growth is overestimated, we may experience cancellations of orders in backlog, rescheduling of customer deliveries, obsolete inventory, and/or liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed.\nIn addition, the demand for some of our customers\u2019 products can be even more volatile and unpredictable due to the possibility of competing technologies, such as flash memory as an alternative to HDDs. Unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our customers\u2019 products or rapid shifts in demand from our customers\u2019 products to alternative technologies could materially adversely impact our future results of operations.\nOur operating results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by tightening credit markets.\nAs a global company with worldwide operations, we are subject to volatility and adverse consequences associated with economic downturns in different parts of the world. In the event of a downturn, many of our customers may delay or further reduce their purchases of our products and services. If negative conditions in the credit markets prevent our customers from obtaining credit or necessary financing, product orders in these channels may decrease, which could result in lower revenue. In addition, we may experience cancellations of orders in backlog, rescheduling of customer deliveries, and pricing pressures. If our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses, they may become unable to continue to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products, which could impair our operations.\nIn addition, we finance some of our sales through trade credit. In addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition, we seek to mitigate our credit risk by obtaining deposits and/or letters of credit on certain of our sales arrangements. We could suffer significant losses if a customer whose accounts receivable we have not secured fails or is otherwise unable to pay us, or if financial institutions providing letters of credit become insolvent. A significant loss in collections on our accounts receivable would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business, including the need to obtain export licenses for certain of our shipments and political risks in the countries we operate.\nMost of our sales are to customers located outside of the United States. We expect sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our sales in the future. Our non-U.S. sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, many of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, managing distributors and representatives, and repatriating cash in a tax efficient manner;\n\u00b7 regional economic downturns, varying foreign government support, and unstable political environments;\n\u00b7 political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations, and policies within countries that favor local companies over U.S. companies, including government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n\u00b7 pressures from foreign customers and foreign governments for us to increase our operations and sourcing in the foreign country;\n\u00b7 longer sales cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 multiple, conflicting, and changing governmental laws and regulations, including varying labor laws, tax regulations, import/export controls, changes to trade treaties, possible trade wars and other trade barriers and uncertainties;\n\u00b7 reliance on various information systems and information technology to conduct our business, which may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, misuse or other causes that could result in business disruptions, loss of or damage to intellectual property, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, or other adverse consequences should our security practices and procedures prove ineffective; and\n\u00b7 different customs and ways of doing business.\nThese challenges, many of which are associated with sales into the Asia-Pacific region, may continue and recur again in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, political instability, terrorism, acts of war, tsunamis, or epidemics in regions where we operate may adversely affect or disrupt our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, products which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) when exported to and re-exported from international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction\u2019s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Currently, our MOCVD deposition systems and certain of our other products are controlled for export under the EAR. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain countries. Obtaining an export license requires cooperation from the customer and customer-facility readiness and can add time to the order fulfillment process. While we have generally been successful in obtaining export licenses in a timely manner, there can be no assurance that this will continue or that an export license can be obtained in each instance where it is required. If an export license is required but cannot be obtained, then we will not be permitted to export the product to the customer. The administrative processing, potential delay, and risk of ultimately not obtaining an export license pose a particular disadvantage to us relative to our non-U.S. competitors who are not required to comply with U.S. export controls. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations could result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of commodities. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any of our shipments violate applicable export regulations, we could be fined significant sums and/or our export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and any determination that we violated these or similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials, as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, many of our customers have policies limiting or prohibiting us from providing certain types or amounts of entertainment, meals, or gifts to their employees. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees and representatives. However, our safeguards may prove to be ineffective and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. In addition, we may acquire a company that has engaged in unlawful conduct in the past, and be held responsible for this conduct through successor liability principles. Violations of the FCPA or similar laws or similar customer policies may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions or the loss of supplier privileges to a customer, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any delays or difficulty in satisfying these requirements or negative reports concerning our internal controls could adversely affect our future results of operations and our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex, costly, time-consuming, and is subject to significant judgment. If our internal controls are ineffective or if our management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal controls, our ability to file timely and accurate periodic reports may be impeded. Any delays in filing may cause us to face the following risks and concerns, among others:\n\u00b7 concern on the part of our customers, partners, investors, and employees about our financial condition and filing delay status, including the potential loss of business opportunities;\n\u00b7 significant time and expense required to complete delayed filings and the distraction of our senior management team and board of directors as we work to complete delayed filings;\n\u00b7 investigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities of the Company and/or our management;\n\u00b7 limitations on our ability to raise capital;\n\u00b7 suspension or termination of our stock listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market and the removal of our stock as a component of certain stock market indices; and\n\u00b7 general reputational harm.\nAny or all of the foregoing could result in the commencement of stockholder lawsuits against the Company. Any such litigation, as well as any proceedings that could arise as a result of a filing delay and the circumstances which gave rise to it, may be time consuming and expensive, may divert management attention from the conduct of our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may expose us to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or other personnel, regardless of the outcome of such matters, which may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future. New rules, changes to existing rules, or the questioning of our current or past practices, such as those associated with our transfer pricing, may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nOur income taxes can change.\nWe are subject to income tax on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis and significant judgment is required in certain instances to allocate our taxable income to a jurisdiction and to determine the related income tax expense and benefits. Losses in one jurisdiction generally may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions. As a result, changes in the mix of our earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions, among other factors, could alter our overall effective income tax rate, possibly resulting in significant tax rate increases.\nWe are regularly audited by various tax authorities. Income tax audit assessments or changes in tax laws, regulations, or other interpretations may result in increased tax provisions which could materially affect our operating results in the period or periods in which such determinations are made or changes occur.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate could increase if we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that we are able to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets, if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we are otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.\nWe may be required to take additional impairment charges on assets.\nWe are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. In the future, a significant decline in the market price of our common stock could indicate a decline in the fair value of our reporting unit such that goodwill becomes impaired. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes which could adversely affect our financial position, prevent us from implementing our strategy, and dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.\nIn January of 2017, we issued $345 million of 2.70% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). The Convertible Notes are convertible into Company common stock at an initial conversion rate of 24.98 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The Company is obligated to repurchase the Convertibles Notes upon the occurrence of certain events described in the indenture relating to the Convertible Notes. The degree to which we are leveraged could have negative consequences, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate, or other purposes may be limited;\n\u00b7 a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations in the future may be required for the payment of the principal amount of our existing indebtedness when it becomes due; and\n\u00b7 we may elect to make cash payments upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes, which would reduce our cash on hand.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under the Convertible Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors, as well as other factors, that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFurthermore, if the Convertible Notes are converted into shares of Company common stock, the issuance of additional shares of Company common stock would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders and could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the Convertible Notes. In addition, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC\n470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash can be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method or that we will continue to expect to settle the principal balance in cash. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nThe price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly.\nThe stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility. If these industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:\n\u00b7 difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis and a failure of large financial institutions;\n\u00b7 receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products;\n\u00b7 issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7 announcements of financial developments or technological innovations;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts;\n\u00b7 changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysts;\n\u00b7 strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs;\n\u00b7 the dilutive impact of our Convertible Notes; and\n\u00b7 the occurrence of major catastrophic events.\nSignificant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive and/or divert our limited resources.\nOur success depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies, and processes. We own various U.S. and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to certain of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be circumvented, invalidated, or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or through efforts by others to reverse engineer our products or design around patents that we own. Given these limitations, our success will depend in part upon our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.\nFurthermore, policing unauthorized use of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming, and the laws of other countries may less effectively protect our proprietary rights than U.S. laws. Our outsourcing strategy requires that we share certain portions of our technology with our outsourcing partners, which poses additional risks of infringement and trade secret misappropriation. Infringement of our rights by a third party, possibly for purposes of developing and selling competing products, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. Similar exposure could result in the event that former employees seek to compete with us through their unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws. Further, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country, including the United States, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing will not be changed in a way detrimental to the sale or use of our products or technology.\nWe may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, incur substantial unexpected costs, and jeopardize relationships with current or prospective customers or suppliers. Any action we take to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, failure to protect our trademark rights could impair our brand identity.\nWe may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by others.\nFrom time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent or other rights which they believe cover certain of our products. We also periodically receive notice from customers who believe that we are required to indemnify them for damages they may incur related to infringement claims made against these customers by third parties. Our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider the available alternatives, including whether to seek a license, if appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. If we are not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risks.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that are inherent in our anticipated sales, sales commitments, and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, hedging activities may not always be available or adequate to mitigate the impact of our exchange rate exposure. Failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage foreign currency risks properly could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIf we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations.\nWe manage, store, and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and/or third party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities.\nThe costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customers or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe have adopted certain measures that may have anti-takeover effects which may make an acquisition of our Company by another company more difficult.\nWe have adopted, and may in the future adopt, certain measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our Company, any of which a holder of our common stock might not consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest. These measures include:\n\u00b7 \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u00b7 a classified board of directors; and\n\u00b7 certain other certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights (including voting rights), preferences, and privileges of these shares (\u201cblank check\u201d preferred). Such preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock. As a result, the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock.\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes with each class serving a staggered three-year term. The existence of a classified board makes it more difficult for our shareholders to change the composition (and therefore the policies) of our board of directors in a relatively short period of time.\nWe have adopted certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions which have anti-takeover effects. These include: (a) requiring certain actions to be taken at a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent, (b) requiring a super-majority of shareholders to approve certain amendments to our bylaws, (c) limiting the maximum number of directors, and (d) providing that directors may be removed only for \u201ccause.\u201d These measures and those described above may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our Company that a holder of our common stock might consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer, or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest.\nDespite the above measures, an activist shareholder could undertake action to implement governance, strategic, or other changes to the Company which a holder of our common stock might not consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans, be costly and time consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees.\nWe are subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations in connection with our business operations, including but not limited to regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of our products, recycling and disposal of related materials, and the operation and use of our facilities and real property. Failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines, and/or the suspension or termination of research, development, or use of certain of our products, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, some of our operations involve the storage, handling, and use of hazardous materials that may pose a risk of fire, explosion, or environmental release. Such events could result from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or operational failures and may result in injury or loss of life to our employees and others, local environmental contamination, and property damage. These events might cause a temporary shutdown of an affected facility, or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result. Each of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nWe have significant operations in locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or other significant disruption.\nOur operations in the United States, the Asia-Pacific region, and in other areas could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, hurricanes, floods, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers, destruction of facilities, and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, various regions of the world in which we do business are subject to the threat of terrorism and acts of war. Any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries in which we operate could result in significant harm to us, including the loss of life and property, manufacturing and transportation delays, disruptions in our supply chain, the need to comply with enhanced security measures, and other increased costs.\nIf we are unable to complete our contemplated acquisition of Ultratech, Inc., our expected financial results and the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOn February 2, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Ultratech, Inc. to acquire all of Ultratech\u2019s issued and outstanding stock through a merger of Ultratech with one of our subsidiaries, Ulysses Acquisition Subsidiary Corp. (the \u201cmerger\u201d). Consummation of the merger is subject to customary conditions to closing, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. If any condition to the merger is not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed. The parties also may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances. Any or all of the preceding could jeopardize our ability to consummate the merger on the negotiated terms. To the extent the merger is not completed for any reason, we would have devoted substantial resources and management attention to the transaction without realizing the accompanying benefits expected by our management, and our financial condition and results of operations and the market value of our stock may be adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties associated with the merger include:\n\u00b7 various conditions to the closing of the merger may not be satisfied or waived;\n\u00b7 the inability to obtain consents from third parties who have \u201cchange of control\u201d or similar clauses in their agreements with Ultratech;\n\u00b7 the failure to consummate the merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community;\n\u00b7 litigation relating to the merger could be commenced, which may prevent the merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame, if at all;\n\u00b7 required regulatory approvals from governmental entities may delay the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could cause the abandonment of the merger; and\n\u00b7 the attention of our employees and management may be diverted due to activities related to the merger, which may harm our relationships with our employees, customers, distributors, suppliers, and other business partners, may impair our ability to continuously innovate to meet the industry inflections, and may result in a loss of or a substantial decrease in purchases by our customers.\nEven if the Ultratech merger is consummated, we may not be able to successfully integrate the business of Ultratech with our own or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices with those of Ultratech. Potential difficulties that the combined company may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u00b7 the inability to successfully combine our business with Ultratech in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the merger;\n\u00b7 the loss of customers and strategic partners who may not wish to continue their relationships with the combined company;\n\u00b7 required regulatory approvals from governmental entities may result in limitations, additional costs or placement of restrictions on the conduct of the combined company, imposition of additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger;\n\u00b7 complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other business partners; and\n\u00b7 potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger.\nIn addition, we have operated and, until the completion of the merger will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the diversion of the attention of our management and the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing business. These and other factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other partners, and our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.", "PERMNO": 81116, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "VECO"}
