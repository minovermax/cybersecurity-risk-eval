A sustained period of low of oil prices is likely to adversely affect our future financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nOil prices are the most important determinant of our operational and financial success. Oil prices are highly impacted by worldwide oil supply, demand and prices, and have historically been subject to significant price changes over short periods of time. Over the last few years, NYMEX oil prices have been volatile, decreasing to a low of $43 in mid-2017 and gradually improving to hit a three-year peak of $76 in October 2018, before retreating to the low $40s in late December 2018 and generally averaging in the low $50s to mid $60s range throughout 2019. Based on past commodity cycles, volatility will remain, and prices could move downward or upward on a rapid or repeated basis, which can make planning and budgeting, acquisition and divestiture transactions, capital raising, valuations and sustaining business strategies more difficult. Our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil, as oil comprised approximately 97% of our 2019 production and approximately 98% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2019. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe level of worldwide consumer demand for oil and natural gas, which has recently been negatively affected by concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus, and the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas and levels of domestic oil and natural gas storage;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which domestic oil and natural gas production affects worldwide supply of crude oil or its price;\n\u2022\nworldwide political events, conditions and policies, including actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations; and\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions.\nNegative movements in oil prices could harm us in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nlower cash flows from operations may require reduced levels of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nreduced levels of capital expenditures in turn could lower our present and future production levels, and lower the quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves, which constitute our major asset;\n\u2022\nour lenders could reduce our borrowing base, and we may not be able to raise capital at attractive rates in the public markets;\n\u2022\nwe could have difficulty repaying or refinancing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe could be forced to increase our level of indebtedness, issue additional equity, or sell assets;\n\u2022\nwe could be required to impair various assets, including a write-down of our oil and natural gas assets or the value of other tangible or intangible assets; and/or\n\u2022\nour potential cash flows from our commodity derivative contracts that include sold puts could be limited to the extent that oil prices are below the prices of those sold puts.\nFurthermore, some or all of our tertiary projects could become or remain uneconomical. We may also decide to suspend future expansion projects, and if prices were to drop below our operating cash break-even points for an extended period of time, we may decide to shut-in existing production, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition and reduce our production.\nWe must refinance, extend or repurchase $1.18 billion principal amount of our indebtedness which matures between May 2021 and May 2022 in order to maintain our continuing financial viability.\nAs of December 31, 2019, of our total outstanding debt principal of $2.3 billion, almost 50% becomes due and payable within 17 to 29 months, with $614.9 million due in May 2021. Our anticipated level of free cash flow during 2020, taken together with current borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, is not sufficient to repay all of our debt that is scheduled to mature in 2021 and 2022.\nWe are evaluating potential transactions to reduce, and/or extend maturities of, our long-term debt, focusing particularly on our second lien debt maturing in May 2021 and in March 2022. In conjunction with our debt reduction and extension efforts, we may engage in transactions of various types, including public or private capital raising, debt exchange transactions, debt repurchases\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nwith proceeds from joint ventures or asset sales, or some combination of these methods. However, our ability to restructure or refinance our long-term debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time and could be affected by concentration in holdings of our long-term debt. Any refinancing of our long-term debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous debt covenants, which could further restrict our business operations or financial flexibility.\nWithout long-term access to capital, continued funding from lenders or sufficient generation of cash flow from our business operations, there continues to be substantial risk that we may be unable to repay or refinance our long-term indebtedness that matures in 2021 and 2022. Any failure to make timely payments of interest and principal when due on any of our outstanding long-term indebtedness could result in cross-defaults of all of our outstanding long-term indebtedness, which could then lead to acceleration of the maturities of such indebtedness and enforcement actions by the holders thereof to collect such indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets to raise sufficient capital to meet our obligations in light of recent trends affecting the financing of the exploration and production sector.\nRecent reluctance of traditional capital sources to invest in the exploration and production sector based on market volatility, perceived underperformance and environmental, social and governance (ESG) trends, has raised concerns regarding capital availability for the sector. The cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards and reduced (and in some cases ceased to provide) funding to borrowers. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access them or alternative financing sources on acceptable terms, we may be unable to repay our long-term debt or carry out our business strategy, with an accompanying negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to service our indebtedness.\nConstraints on liquidity could limit our operational flexibility and growth.\nIn recent years, we have been successful in managing our capital expenditures so that they do not exceed our cash flows. Although our liquidity has been, and in 2020 is expected to remain, sufficient to support our capital expenditures and service our indebtedness, liquidity restrictions coming from lower oil prices and restraints on traditional capital sources for the exploration and production industry could negatively affect our level of capital expenditures, and thus our maintenance of production and operational cash flow. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity pressure, and might be required to dispose of material assets at unfavorable prices.\nIf we cannot meet the \u201cprice criteria\u201d for continued listing on the NYSE, the NYSE may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock, or the trading prices of our 6\u215c% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024.\nIf we do not maintain an average closing price of $1.00 or more for our common stock over any consecutive 30 trading-day period, the NYSE may delist our common stock for a failure to maintain compliance with the NYSE price criteria listing standards. As of February 25, 2020, the average closing price of our common stock over the immediately preceding 30 consecutive trading day period was $1.04 per share, and our closing price was $0.84 per share on February 25, 2020. Despite NYSE rules and processes that provide a period of time to cure non-compliance with this NYSE standard (during which time the issuer\u2019s common stock generally continues to be traded on the NYSE), there is no assurance that trading prices of our common stock or other steps we take (such as a reverse stock split) would be successful in assuring our long-term listing on the NYSE. A delisting of our common stock from the NYSE would likely reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock and the trading prices of our 6\u215c% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024, reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, and negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing.\nA financial downturn in one or more of the world\u2019s major markets could negatively affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition to the impact on the demand for oil, drops in domestic or foreign economic growth rates, regional or worldwide increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions, significant international currency fluctuations, evolving political and military tensions in the Middle East, a sustained credit crisis, or a worsening of the actual or anticipated future drop in worldwide oil demand due to the COVID-19 coronavirus, a severe economic contraction either regionally or worldwide or turmoil in the global financial system, could materially affect our business and financial condition or impact our ability to finance operations. Negative credit market conditions could inhibit our lenders from funding our senior secured bank credit facility or cause them to restrict our\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nborrowing base or make the terms of our senior secured bank credit facility more costly and more restrictive. Negative economic conditions could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers or cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by increases in interest rates. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow, affect our interest costs under our senior secured bank credit facility, or increase the cost of any new debt financings.\nOur bank credit facility maturity date \u201csprings forward\u201d to dates earlier than December 9, 2021 if certain conditions are not satisfied.\nThe Company\u2019s senior secured bank credit facility provides for acceleration of its December 9, 2021 maturity date to earlier dates during 2021, keyed to the maturity dates during 2021 of our 9% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due May 15, 2021 (the \u201c2021 Senior Secured Notes\u201d) and our 6\u215c% Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2021 (the \u201c2021 Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), as follows:\n\u2022\nTo February 12, 2021, if on that date the sum of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and borrowing availability under the senior secured bank credit facility is less than 120% of the amount of the then outstanding 2021 Senior Secured Notes;\n\u2022\nTo May 14, 2021, if either (a) prior to that date the 2021 Senior Secured Notes have not been repaid or otherwise redeemed in full, or (b) on that date the sum of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and borrowing availability under the senior secured bank credit facility is less than 120% of the amount of the then outstanding 2021 Senior Subordinated Notes; or\n\u2022\nTo August 13, 2021, if prior to that date the 2021 Senior Subordinated Notes have not been repaid or otherwise redeemed in full.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings and $87.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under our senior secured bank credit facility. The average outstanding balance under the credit facility as of the last day of each month during 2019 was $40.6 million. Our inability to repay amounts owing under our senior secured bank credit facility on any of the above springing maturity dates could trigger a cross-default under, and potentially an acceleration of, all of our other long-term indebtedness then outstanding. Based upon our use of the senior secured bank credit facility for short-term working capital purposes, we anticipate that any amounts outstanding from time to time under the credit facility during 2020 and 2021 can be repaid using our then-available cash flow from operations.\nInability to meet financial performance covenants in our bank credit facility may require us to seek modification of covenants, force a reduction in our borrowing base, or cause repayment of amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility.\nIn August 2018, we extended the maturity of our bank credit facility to December 2021 and reset certain financial performance covenants based on projections and oil price expectations that existed at that time. Oil prices subsequent to August 2018 have been volatile, and if oil and natural gas prices decrease for an extended period of time, we may not be able to remain in compliance with our senior secured bank credit facility\u2019s covenants. As such, we may be required to seek modifications of these covenants or a waiver at a significant cost to the Company, or the banks could force a reduction in our bank borrowing base and repayment of amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had no bank debt outstanding, but we did have $87.2 million of letters of credit outstanding. If necessary, we may not be able to successfully modify these covenants or obtain a waiver of compliance with these covenants. For more information on our senior secured bank credit facility, see Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Senior Secured Bank Credit Facility.\nOur bank borrowing base is determined semiannually, and upon requested unscheduled special redeterminations, in each case at the banks\u2019 discretion, and the amount is established and based, in part, upon certain external factors, such as commodity prices. We do not know, nor can we control, the results of such redeterminations or the effect of then-current oil and natural gas prices on any such redetermination. A future redetermination lowering our borrowing base could limit availability under our senior secured bank credit facility or require us to seek different forms of financing arrangements. If the outstanding debt under our senior secured bank credit facility were to ever exceed the borrowing base, we would be required to repay the excess amount over a period not to exceed six months.\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nCertain of our operations may be limited during certain periods due to severe weather conditions and other regulations.\nOur operations in the Gulf Coast region may be subjected to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, which can also increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations. Certain of our operations in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, including the construction of CO2 pipelines, the drilling of new wells and production from existing wells, are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions including severe cold, snow and rain, which conditions may cause such operations to be hindered or delayed, or otherwise require that they be conducted only during non-winter months, and depending on the severity of the weather, could have a negative effect on our results of operations in these areas. Further, the potential impacts of climate change on our operations may include unusually intense rainfall and storm patterns, rising sea levels and increased high temperatures.\nCertain of our operations in the Rocky Mountain region are confined to certain time periods due to environmental regulations, federal restrictions on when drilling can take place on federal lands, and lease stipulations designed to protect certain wildlife, which regulations, restrictions and limitations could slow down our operations, cause delays, increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us.\nGiven the political uncertainty about proposals to combat climate change and how it should be dealt with, it is possible that legislation and regulations could affect our financial condition and operating performance. However, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by our industry could harm our reputation and impact operations.\nOil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident and inherent to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including, without limitation, pipe failure; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks and well blowouts, cratering or explosions. In addition, our operations are sometimes near populated commercial or residential areas, which adds additional risks. The nature of these risks is such that some liabilities could exceed our insurance policy limits or otherwise be excluded from, or limited by, our insurance coverage, as in the case of environmental fines and penalties, for example, which are excluded from coverage as they cannot be insured.\nWe could incur significant costs related to these risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or could have an adverse effect upon the profitability of our operations. Additionally, a portion of our production activities involves CO2 injections into fields with wells plugged and abandoned by prior operators. However, it is often difficult (or impracticable) to determine whether a well has been properly plugged prior to commencing injections and pressuring the oil reservoirs. We may incur significant costs in connection with remedial plugging operations to prevent environmental contamination and to otherwise comply with federal, state and local regulations relative to the plugging and abandoning of our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells. In addition to the increased costs, if wells have not been properly plugged, modification to those wells may delay our operations and reduce our production.\nDevelopment activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, and winter conditions and forest fires in the Rocky Mountain region that can delay or impede operations;\nDenbury Resources Inc.\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, pipelines and services; and\n\u2022\ntitle problems.\nEstimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.\nEstimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including future production rates, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental rules and regulations. There are numerous uncertainties about when a property may have proved reserves as compared to potential or probable reserves, particularly relating to our tertiary recovery operations. Forecasting the amount of oil reserves recoverable from tertiary operations, and the production rates anticipated therefrom, requires estimates, one of the most significant being the oil recovery factor. Actual results most likely will vary from our estimates. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor for reporting purposes, as prescribed by the SEC, may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which our business, and the oil and natural gas industry in general, are subject. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions, or changes of conditions, could result in a revision of the quantities and net present value of our reserves.\nThe reserves data included in documents incorporated by reference represents estimates only. Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions, including first-day-of-the-month average oil and natural gas prices for the 12-month period preceding the date of the assessment. The representative oil and natural gas prices used in estimating our December 31, 2019 reserves were $55.69 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.58 per MMBtu for natural gas, both of which were adjusted for market differentials by field. Our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic conditions, including oil and natural gas prices, as well as due to production results, results of future development, operating and development costs, and other factors. Downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in our estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 10% of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and may require successful drilling operations. The reserves data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, but these assumptions may not be accurate, and these expenditures and operations may not occur.\nIf commodity prices decline appreciably, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nUnder full cost accounting rules related to our oil and natural gas properties, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation, with the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling. The present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves included in the cost center ceiling is based on the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period prior to the end of a particular reporting period. Future material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties, as well as future impairment of other long-lived assets, could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which such write-down and/or impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to long-lived assets and equity. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nOur planned tertiary operations and the related construction of necessary CO2 pipelines could be delayed by difficulties in obtaining pipeline rights-of-way and/or permits, and/or by the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered.\nThe production of crude oil from our planned tertiary operations is dependent upon having access to pipelines to transport available CO2 to our oil fields at a cost that is economically viable. Our future construction of CO2 pipelines will require us to obtain rights-of-way from private landowners, state and local governments and the federal government in certain areas. Certain states where we operate have considered or may again consider the adoption of laws or regulations that could limit or eliminate the ability of a pipeline owner or of a state, state\u2019s legislature or its administrative agencies to exercise eminent domain over private property, in addition to possible judicially imposed constraints on, and additional requirements for, the exercise of eminent domain. We also conduct operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases inhabited by species that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, which listing could lead to tighter restrictions as to federal land use and other land use where federal approvals are required. These laws and regulations, together with any other changes in law related\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nto the use of eminent domain or the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered, could inhibit or eliminate our ability to secure rights-of-way or otherwise access land for current or future pipeline construction projects and may require additional regulatory and environmental compliance, and increased costs in connection therewith, which could delay our CO2 pipeline construction schedule and initiation of our pipeline operations, and/or increase the costs of constructing our pipelines.\nThe ultimate cost of our planned 105-mile CCA pipeline extension may exceed our estimates, and there may be limited availability of capital for its construction. We may not be successful in entering into a joint venture for the extension and may be unable to raise third-party funds for our CCA pipeline extension spend in 2020. In addition, while we anticipate completion of the CCA pipeline extension by the end of 2020, the actual date of completion may be later due to, among other factors, capital constraints and the regulatory issues discussed above.\nOur future performance depends upon our ability to effectively develop our existing oil and natural gas reserves and find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nUnless we can successfully develop our existing reserves and/or replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations. We have historically replaced reserves through both acquisitions and internal organic growth activities. For internal organic growth activities, the magnitude of proved reserves that we can book in any given year depends on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response, as well as the success of exploitation projects. In the future, we may not be able to continue to replace reserves at acceptable costs. The business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive. We may not be able to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if our cash flows from operations are reduced, whether due to current oil or natural gas prices or otherwise, or if external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Further, the process of using CO2 for tertiary recovery, and the related infrastructure, requires significant capital investment prior to any resulting and associated production and cash flows from these projects, heightening potential capital constraints. If our capital expenditures are restricted, or if outside capital resources become limited, we will not be able to maintain our current production levels.\nCommodity derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss.\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative contracts in order to economically hedge a portion of our forecasted oil and natural gas production. As of February 24, 2020, we have oil derivative contracts in place covering 39,500 Bbls/d for the first half of 2020 and 35,500 Bbls/d for the second half of 2020. Such derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received, when the cash benefit from hedges including a sold put is limited to the extent oil prices fall below the price of our sold puts, or when the counterparty to the derivative contract is financially constrained and defaults on its contractual obligations. In addition, these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas.\nShortages of or delays in the availability of oil field equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, causing periodic shortages in such personnel. In the past, there have been shortages of oil field and other necessary equipment, including drilling rigs, along with increased prices for such equipment, services and associated personnel. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill wells and conduct our operations, possibly causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation lines and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. When these facilities are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends, in part, upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation lines owned by third parties. In general, we do not control these transportation facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied. A significant disruption in the availability of, and access to, these transportation lines or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations.\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nOur production will decline if our access to sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide is limited.\nOur long-term strategy is primarily focused on our CO2 tertiary recovery operations. The crude oil production from our tertiary recovery projects depends, in large part, on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring and industrial-sourced CO2. Our ability to produce oil from these projects would be hindered if our supply of CO2 was limited due to, among other things, problems with our current CO2 producing wells and facilities, including compression equipment, catastrophic pipeline failure or our ability to economically purchase CO2 from industrial sources. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our anticipated future crude oil production from tertiary operations is also dependent on the timing, volumes and location of CO2 injections and, in particular, on our ability to increase our combined purchased and produced volumes of CO2 and inject adequate amounts of CO2 into the proper formation and area within each of our tertiary oil fields.\nThe development of our naturally occurring CO2 sources involves the drilling of wells to increase and extend the CO2 reserves available for use in our tertiary fields. These drilling activities are subject to many of the same drilling and geological risks of drilling and producing oil and gas wells (see Oil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks above). Furthermore, recent market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of construction of plants that produce industrial-source CO2 as a byproduct that we can purchase, thus limiting the amount of industrial-source CO2 available for our use in our tertiary operations.\nA cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, among other things, to process and record financial and operating data; analyze seismic and drilling information; monitor and control pipeline and plant equipment; and process and store personally identifiable information of our employees and royalty owners. Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could compromise our process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to our business operations, harm to the environment or our assets, disruptions in access to our financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of our critical data and proprietary information, including our business information and that of our employees, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing may be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident. Cyber attacks could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAlthough we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing and causing us to suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our procedures and controls or to investigate and remediate any digital and operational systems, related infrastructure, technologies and network security vulnerabilities, which could increase our costs.\nWe may lose key executive officers or specialized technical employees, which could endanger the future success of our operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers, other key management and specialized technical personnel. Our employees, including our executive officers, are employed at will and do not have employment agreements. We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are costly and stringent.\nOur exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the protection of endangered species. These laws and regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the\nDenbury Resources Inc.\nimposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes, without regard to fault, or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators.\nEnactment of executive, legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.\nAlthough the current Administration has moved away from the trend of proposing stricter standards and increasing oversight and regulation over the exploration and production industry at the federal level, it is possible that other proposals affecting the oil and gas industry could be enacted or adopted in the future, including state or local regulations, any of which could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions that could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold.\nThe loss of one or more of our large oil and natural gas purchasers could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, three purchasers individually accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues and, in the aggregate, for 54% of such revenues. The loss of a large single purchaser could adversely impact the prices we receive or the transportation costs we incur.", "PERMNO": 82196, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "DNRCQ"}
