RISK FACTORS\nWithout additional financing, our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to repay an outstanding promissory note and fund our operations if the promissory note is called for redemption by the holder. Under Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, that contingency creates substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern because the call for redemption of the promissory note is outside of our control and resolving that contingency depends upon our raising additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms.\nIn August 2014, the FASB released ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, which requires a company to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within the one year period subsequent to the date that the financial statements are issued or within the one year period subsequent the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. This accounting guidance was effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our cash resources and cash flows from operations have been sufficient to pay our obligations and debts as they become due. However, our current capital resources may not be sufficient to repay a promissory note payable to Elutions Capital Ventures S.\u00e0 r.l, a subsidiary of Elutions, in an aggregate original principal amount of $3.3 million (\"Elutions Note\"), if it were to be called for redemption, and to fund our operations going forward. The Elutions Note matures on March 18, 2019, but may be called for redemption by the holder at any time and is payable 30 days after it is called for redemption. In addition, we are obligated to pay the earn-out consideration that is potentially payable in connection with the acquisition of the Farncombe Entities in 2015. The earn-out consideration that is potentially payable represents 40% of the notional purchase price of the Farncombe Entities and may be up to \u00a3719,483 pounds sterling (approximately US$0.9 million based on an exchange rate of \u00a31.000 = US$1.234 as of December 31, 2016) and up to 461,055 shares of Company common stock (approximately \u00a31,024,765 pounds sterling or US$1.3 million based on an exchange rate of \u00a31.000= US$1.234 as of December 31, 2016). We are not in default under the Elutions Note and do not have any reason to currently expect that the Elutions Note will be called for redemption, given that (i) we are paying our debts as they become due (including making timely payments of interest on the Elutions Note), (ii) a call by the holder of the Elutions Note would cause Elutions to no longer have the right to purchase shares of stock pursuant to the Tracking Warrant and (iii) Elutions is a significant stockholder of the Company and a call by the holder of the Elutions Note for redemption may adversely affect the value of Elutions' other equity holdings in the Company. Under the Tracking Warrant, Elutions has the right to purchase up to 996,544 shares of common stock of the Company for $3.28 per share. The Tracking Warrant expires March 18, 2020. Although we do not have any reason to currently expect that the Elutions Note will be called for redemption, any determination by the holder of the Elutions Note is outside of our control.\nWe have entered into receivable financing and factoring arrangements with respect to certain accounts receivable, provided that our ability to finance receivables is subject to limitations, including in certain arrangements the willingness of the purchaser to purchase individual accounts receivable that are offered by us. If the Elutions Note is called for redemption by the holder or if we realize significant negative cash flows from operations, we will be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. As further described in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\", Elutions has certain rights of first offer in connection with debt financings by us, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, if we obtain debt financing from other lenders, subject to certain exceptions, Elutions may require us to redeem the Elutions Note and to repurchase the shares of our common stock originally acquired by Elutions at a price based upon market prices over 15 trading days prior to the repurchase. In addition, Elutions has certain preemptive rights in connection with equity issuances by us, subject to certain exceptions, and we and our subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of Elutions, issue options, warrants or similar rights or convertible securities, other than with respect to certain excluded issuances.\nWe are exploring alternatives to address our liquidity needs in the event the Elutions Note is called for redemption. However, there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our ability to secure new financing may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions. If financing is obtained through the sale of additional equity securities or debt securities with equity features, it could result in dilution to our stockholders. If adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Management has concluded under the new accounting standard that there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern if the Company is unable to arrange financing sufficient to pay off the Elutions note upon a call for redemption. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to (i) initiate litigation or seek protection under bankruptcy reorganization laws, or (ii) liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty, including any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of large clients for a major portion of our revenues, and the loss of a major client or the cancellation of a significant contract could substantially reduce revenues and harm our business and liquidity.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of clients. This results in part from a conscious strategy to market our services to the largest and most stable companies in the industry, but our concentration of revenues with a small number of clients does expose us to risk. Our revenues and financial condition could be impaired if a major client stopped using our services. The services required by any one client may be affected by industry consolidation or adverse industry conditions, technological developments, economic slowdown or the client's internal strategy or budget constraints. As a result, the volume of work performed for specific clients varies from period to period, and a major client in one period may not use our services in a subsequent period.\nOur business is affected by conditions in the communications, digital media, and technology industries, and any adverse changes in conditions in these industries may adversely affect the demand for our services.\nWe focus extensively on customers in the converging communications, media and entertainment industry and investment banking and private equity firms investing in that industry. The sector in which we operate is currently going through significant consolidation. Consolidation within the sector tends to result in increased consolidation of competitors for services we provide. The supply chain divisions within larger clients, given sector consolidation, also tend to reduce the number of vendors utilized and to negotiate volume programs with select preferred vendors. This consolidation could result in further price reductions, fewer client projects, under-utilization of consultants, reduced operating margins and loss of market share. In addition, the rate of change brought about by new technology within the communications and media sector and related impact on our clients' business models may cause our clients to cancel or delay consulting initiatives. These trends could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to raise capital. Other factors outside of our control could also cause companies to delay new product or business initiatives or to seek to control expenses by reducing the use of outside consultants. Future client financial difficulties and/or bankruptcies could require us to write-off receivables that are in excess of bad debt reserves, which would harm our results of operations in future periods.\nWe have experienced losses from operations, and any future losses and negative cash flows from operations could materially adversely affect our limited liquidity.\nWe incurred a net loss of $13.9 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and a net loss of approximately $7.7 million in the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016. Our cash used by operations was $2.3 million and $2.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. We had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million and working capital of $4.0 million as of December 31, 2016. If we do not achieve sustained profitable operations and positive cash flows from operations, we could experience significant liquidity challenges.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors. Any of these factors could adversely affect our stock price. Factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include:\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the communications industry and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nglobal economic, industry and political conditions and related risks, including acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nthe beginning and ending of significant contracts during a quarter;\n\u2022\nthe size and scope of projects;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key clients or cancellation or deferral of significant engagements;\n\u2022\nthe form of customer contracts changing primarily from time and materials to fixed price or contingent fee, based on project results;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key management or consultants, which could cause clients to end their relationships with us;\n\u2022\nthe ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our services resulting from client budget cuts, or project delays, industry consolidations or downturns or similar events;\n\u2022\nreductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors;\n\u2022\nseasonality during the summer, vacation and holiday periods, especially in Europe;\n\u2022\nconsultant utilization and billing rates; and\n\u2022\nour use of estimates of the costs and timing to complete ongoing projects.\nBecause a significant portion of our non-consultant expenses are relatively fixed, a variation in the number of client assignments or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter-to-quarter. To the extent the addition of consultant employees is not followed by corresponding increases in revenues, additional expenses would be incurred that would not be matched by corresponding revenues. Therefore, profitability would decline and we could potentially experience further losses.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security, which could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business and financial results of operations.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely store, process, use and transmit electronic information and to communicate among our locations in the U.S., U.K. and Europe and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors. Such information includes intellectual property, both our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continue to grow, the potential risk of cyber-attacks increases. Such cyber-attacks, whether through computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses, human errors, system failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, may lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and the potential for unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information.\nIn providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize, store and transmit sensitive or confidential client or Cartesian data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or Cartesian data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. These monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant. Failure to maintain sufficient controls to ensure privacy and the security of electronic information could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client, employee or Cartesian data, whether by our employees or third parties, including through system failure, human error or a cyber-attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, malware, worms or other malicious software programs, may result in significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our cyber risk and other insurance might not be sufficient to cover us against claims related to security incidents, cyber-attacks and other related events. Attempting to protect our information technology networks and systems may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third-party security experts and consultants.\nSystem disruption, failures or breaches may result in customer dissatisfaction, customer loss or both, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results.\nOur systems are an integral part of our ability to serve our customers and maintain our ongoing business operations. The continued and uninterrupted performance of these systems is critical to our success. Customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide services to them. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our services significantly and could result in decreased demand for our products and services.\nOur ability to serve our customers depends on our ability to protect our computer systems against damage from fire, power loss, water damage, telecommunications failures, earthquake, terrorism attack, vandalism and similar unexpected adverse events. Despite our efforts to implement network security measures, our systems are also vulnerable to computer viruses, attacks, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. There can be no assurance that a material failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it will be adequately addressed.\nWe have experienced systems outages and service interruptions in the past. To date, these outages have not had a material adverse effect on us. Given the rapidly expanding and changing cybersecurity threat landscape that exists today, it is not commercially reasonable to expect that some sort of cybersecurity event will never occur to Cartesian or the systems of any third-party providers Cartesian relies upon. This is particularly true because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and attacks can originate from a wide array of sources, including third parties outside the Company, such as persons involved in organized crimes or associated with external service providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients.\nWe are evaluating our cybersecurity program to put a greater focus on prevention, detection and incident response. However, in the future, a prolonged system-wide outage or frequent outages could cause harm to our reputation and could cause our customers to make claims against us for damages allegedly resulting from an outage or interruption. Any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations could result in material harm to our business and expose us to material liabilities. Should these measures be insufficient, fail or be breached our operations could be adversely affected, possibly materially.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results.\nWe maintain internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or a failure to establish appropriate controls or to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results.\nWe are subject to operational risk, and resulting losses from operational risk could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results.\nWe are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct certain of our business activities. Although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls, resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities, any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results.\nA significant portion of our business is represented by fixed fee contracts, which expose us to additional risks.\nFixed fee contracts entail subjective judgments and estimates about revenue recognition and are subject to uncertainties and contingencies. Fixed fee contracts expose us to the risk that our costs of performing the contract may be higher than expected, which may reduce or eliminate our profit margin from the contract or result in a loss.\nThe market in which we operate is intensely competitive, and actions by competitors could render our services less competitive, causing revenues and income to decline.\nThe market for communications consulting services remains intensely competitive, highly fragmented and rapidly changing. We face competition from major business and strategy consulting firms, large systems integration and major global outsourcing firms as a result of the outsourcing of business support systems and operating support systems by communications companies, offshore development firms from the Asian markets, equipment and software firms that have added service offerings, boutique consulting firms and customers' internal resources. We believe that there has been a significant increase in recent years in demand for firms that can bundle business process outsourcing, or BPO, with systems and technical integration. Many of our competitors are large organizations that provide a broad range of services to companies in many industries, including the communications industry. In addition, we compete with boutique firms that maintain specialized skills and/or geographical advantages. Many information technology consulting firms also maintain significant practice groups devoted to the communications industry. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than us. We may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors. If we are unable to compete effectively, our market position, and therefore our revenues and profitability, would decline.\nOur international operations expose us to a number of business and economic risks, which could result in increased expenses and declining profitability.\nA substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign markets and a substantial portion of our revenues and costs are derived from our international business. Our international operations expose us to a number of business and economic risks, including:\n\u2022\nunfavorable foreign currency exchange rates or fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activity;\n\u2022\ncompetition from domestic and foreign-based consulting companies;\n\u2022\nour ability to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in trading policies and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlegal uncertainties inherent in transnational operations such as export and import regulations, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nthe impact of foreign laws, regulations and trade customs;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign taxation issues;\n\u2022\noperational issues such as longer customer payment cycles and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nlanguage and cultural differences;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign communications markets;\n\u2022\nincreased cost of marketing to and servicing international clients;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic trends, including economic conditions in foreign markets and the potential impact of terrorist attacks or international hostilities; and\n\u2022\nexpropriations of assets, including bank accounts, intellectual property and physical assets by foreign governments.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully execute our business plan in foreign markets. If we are unable to achieve anticipated levels of revenues from or efficiently manage our international operations, our overall revenues and profitability may decline.\nOur engagements with clients may not be profitable or may be terminated by our clients on short notice, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnexpected costs, delays or failure to achieve anticipated cost reductions could make our contracts unprofitable. We have many types of contracts, including time and materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contingent fee contracts. When making proposals for engagements, we estimate the costs and timing for completing the projects. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding our costs, as well as the efficiencies of our methodologies and professionals as we plan to deploy them on our projects. Any increased or unexpected costs, delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost reductions in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable, which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin.\nUnder many of our contracts, the payment of some or all of our fees is conditioned upon our performance. We have increasingly moved away from contracts that are priced solely on a time and materials basis and toward contracts that also include incentives related to factors such as benefits produced. The trend to include greater incentives in our contracts may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts, and may expose us to greater risk of loss on the contracts if we do not perform successfully. Additionally, the estimates required for revenue recognition on these contracts expose us to variability in financial results.\nA majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant penalty. Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive, engagement-by-engagement basis, rather than under exclusive long-term contracts. A majority of our consulting engagements are less than 12 months in duration. The advance notice of termination required for contracts of shorter duration and lower revenues is typically 30 days. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts generally require a longer notice period for termination and may include an early termination charge to be paid to us. Additionally, large client projects involve multiple engagements or stages, and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements. These terminations, cancellations or delays could result from factors unrelated to our work product or the project, such as business or financial conditions of the client, changes in client strategies or the economy in general. When contracts are terminated, we lose the associated revenues and we may not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner. Consequently, our profit margins in subsequent periods may be lower than expected.\nOur profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control costs.\nOur profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to obtain for our services and the utilization rate, or chargeability, of our professionals. If we do not maintain pricing for our services and an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals without corresponding cost reductions, our profitability will suffer. We are under increasing price competition from competitors, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe must continually enhance our services to meet the changing needs of the convergence of communications customers with media and entertainment, or we may lose future business to our competitors.\nOur future success will depend upon our ability to enhance existing services and to introduce new services to meet the requirements of customers in a rapidly developing and evolving market, particularly in the areas of wireless communications and next-generation technologies supporting the convergence of communications, media and entertainment. Present or future services may not satisfy the needs of the communications market. If we are unable to anticipate or respond adequately to customer needs, we may lose business and our financial performance will suffer.\nIf we are not able to effectively recruit and retain management and consulting personnel that provide us with new talent sets enabling the implementation of new strategic offerings in a rapidly changing market, our financial performance may be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to adapt to changing market conditions will depend on our ability to recruit and retain talented personnel, which cannot be assured. We may face two critical challenges in the recruitment of new management personnel. The first is the ability to recruit talented management personnel with the skill sets necessary to capitalize on an industry undergoing revolutionary change, and the second is the ability to execute such recruitment with an appropriate compensation arrangement. If we are unable to recruit and retain the people we need to perform our consulting engagements in a rapidly changing environment, our business may suffer.\nThe number of potential consultants that meet our hiring criteria is relatively small, and there is significant competition for these consultants from direct competitors and others in our sector. Competition for these consultants may result in significant increases in our costs to attract and retain the consultants, which could reduce margins and profitability. Any inability to recruit new consultants or retain existing consultants could impair our ability to service existing engagements or undertake new engagements. If we are unable to attract and retain quality consultants, our revenues and profitability would decline.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key personnel, and the loss of these individuals could harm our competitive position and financial performance.\nOur business consists primarily of the delivery of professional services and, accordingly, our success depends upon the efforts, abilities, business generation capabilities and project execution of our executive officers and key consultants. Our success is also dependent upon the managerial, operational, marketing, and administrative skills of our executive officers. The loss of any executive officer, business unit manager or key consultant or group of consultants, or the failure of these individuals to generate business or otherwise perform at or above expectations, could result in a loss of customers or revenues or increases in expenses, any of which could harm our financial performance.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with strategic alliances.\nWe have strategic alliances, such as our strategic alliance with Elutions, and we may enter into or develop strategic alliances in the future in order to expand our reach into markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find suitable business relationships as we develop new products, services or strategies. The success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners. Strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances, certain of which may have substantially greater financial, marketing or technological resources than us, will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future, discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors.\nWe depend on subcontractors or the third parties with whom we partner for certain projects and service offerings. If these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or we are unable to maintain these relationships, our financial performance and business prospects could be adversely affected.\nCertain of our projects and service offerings require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions integrate with the software, systems, or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers. Our ability to serve our clients and deliver and implement our solutions in a timely manner depends on our ability to retain and maintain relationships with subcontractors, vendors, and service providers and the ability of these subcontractors, vendors, and service providers to meet their obligations in a timely manner, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractors or customer concerns about the subcontractors. Disputes with subcontractors could lead to litigation. Adverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. In addition, if any of our subcontractors fails to perform on a timely basis the agreed-upon services, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in the termination of our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability for damages and have an adverse effect on our financial performance and our ability to compete for future contracts.\nWe previously classified a large number of service providers and subcontractors as independent contractors for tax and employment law purposes. If these firms or personnel were to be reclassified as employees, we could be subject to back taxes, interest, penalties and other legal claims.\nWe previously provided a significant percentage of consulting services through independent contractors and, therefore, did not pay federal or state employment taxes or withhold income taxes for such persons. We generally did not include these independent contractors in our benefit plans. In the future, the Internal Revenue Service, or state authorities may challenge the status of consultants as independent contractors. Independent contractors may also initiate proceedings to seek reclassification as employees under state law. In either case, if persons engaged by us as independent contractors were determined to be employees by the Internal Revenue Service, any state taxation department, or a court, we could become liable for amounts required to be paid or withheld in prior periods along with interest and penalties. In addition, we could be required to include such contractors in benefit plans retroactively and going forward.\nWe could be subject to claims for professional liability, which could harm our financial performance.\nAs a provider of professional services, we face the risk of liability claims. A liability claim brought against us could harm our business. We may also be subject to claims by clients for the actions of our consultants and employees arising from damages to clients' business or otherwise, or clients may demand a reduction in fees because of dissatisfaction with our services or the services of our independent contractors.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and financial performance.\nDespite our efforts to protect proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, parties, including former employees or consultants, may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our solutions or technologies. The steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information could make our solutions and methodologies available to others and harm our competitive position.\nWe may not be able to use some or all of our net operating loss carry-forwards to offset future income.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized will expire at various times between 2020 and 2036. If we continue to report net operating losses for financial reporting in either our domestic or international operations, no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses, since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize the net operating loss carry-forwards in the future. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, these carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitation on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards, or net operating losses, to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change, as may future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price. If an ownership change has occurred or does occur in the future, our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset income if we attain profitability may be limited.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe possible issuance of common stock subject to options and warrants may dilute the interest of stockholders.\nWe granted warrants to purchase a total of 4,396,544 shares of our common stock under the Tracking Warrant and the Incentive Warrant (each as defined below) issued to Elutions in connection with our strategic relationship with Elutions, as more fully described in Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc., in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d of this report. In addition, the warrants include economic anti-dilution provisions, which provide that if we issue shares of common stock in the future below market price in certain transactions, the number of shares of common stock that could be acquired by Elutions may increase, further diluting the ownership interests and voting rights of our other stockholders.\nThe warrants also permit Elutions (subject to certain exceptions) to purchase shares in future equity offerings made by us on a pro rata basis to all stockholders, and our Investment Agreement with Elutions grants it preemptive rights with respect to certain other equity issuances by us. Although the purchase rights provisions in the warrants and preemptive rights provisions in the Investment Agreement are intended to allow Elutions to maintain its potential ownership percentage, such provisions may cause Elutions' ownership percentage to increase if other stockholders do not exercise their purchase rights in a rights offering that triggers the purchase rights under the warrants or if we do not sell all of the remaining shares in an offering for which Elutions was granted preemptive rights under the Investment Agreement, subject to certain limits on Elutions' percentage ownership of our common stock, as described below.\nIn addition, our agreement with Elutions requires us to negotiate in good faith with Elutions for the purchase by Elutions of additional shares of our common stock equal to 6.5% of outstanding shares from us or in open market purchases if Elutions then owns or is vested with the right to acquire 38.5% of the shares of our common stock then outstanding, subject to any applicable stockholder approval requirements. These additional issuances would substantially dilute the ownership interests and voting rights of our other stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, and investors may experience investment losses.\nOur stock price is volatile and could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nany failure to achieve sustained profitable operations and positive cash flow;\n\u2022\nany adverse changes in our liquidity;\n\u2022\nvariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations that could render our talent outdated;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions of and future trends in the sector in which we operate;\n\u2022\nfuture acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or others in the industry;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve financial analysts' or our own estimates of revenues or operating results;\n\u2022\nour relatively small public float and the relatively low volume at which our stock trades;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of performance or recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nany future reduction in our revenues; and\n\u2022\nany future adverse market conditions in the communications industry or the economy as a whole.\nIn addition, the stock market itself experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations particularly affect the market prices of the securities of many technology and communications companies. These broad market fluctuations could harm the market price of our common stock. Our market capitalization may also discourage analysts and investors from following us. Because of our limited public float, our stock price can be susceptible to significant fluctuations based upon a comparatively low trading volume. Additionally, due to the limited public float of our common stock, investors may find their investment illiquid, and suffer losses.\nThe largest beneficial owner of our common stock may have substantial influence over us.\nIn connection with the entering into our strategic relationship with Elutions, as more fully described in Note 3, Strategic Alliance and Investment by Elutions, Inc., in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d of this report, we issued to Elutions 609,756 shares of our common stock and a Tracking Warrant to purchase 996,544 shares of our common stock. These issuances, together, represent approximately 16.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis after such potential issuance under the Tracking Warrant, based on the shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016. In addition, together with the Incentive Warrant, the total potential ownership amount of Elutions would represent approximately 37.4% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis after such potential issuances under the Warrants, based on the shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Accordingly, Elutions is the largest beneficial owner of our shares of common stock and has substantial current and potential future influence over all matters submitted to the stockholders for approval (including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets).\nIn addition, Elutions has certain rights under the Investment Agreement in connection with its investment in Cartesian. We agreed to certain affirmative and negative covenants in the Investment Agreement with respect to the promissory note issued in the transaction with Elutions. Also, as further described in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\", Elutions has certain rights of first offer in connection with debt financing by us and has certain preemptive rights in connection with equity issuances by us, subject in each case to certain exceptions. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of Elutions, issue options, warrants or similar rights or convertible securities, other than with respect to certain excluded issuances.\nThere can be no assurance that Elutions' interests will not be adverse to the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership of our shares of common stock and other rights may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, any of which could be beneficial to our stockholders. Elutions, or other persons who control a substantial percentage of our common stock, including members of our Board of Directors, may experience conflicts between their own interests or the interests of their investors and the interests of our public stockholders.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds in the future, which may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions.\nWe may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing in the future to support our operations or complete acquisitions. There can be no assurances any such capital would be available to us on acceptable terms. Any additional equity financing, if available, may be dilutive to our stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, which may limit our operating flexibility. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution in the voting power or net book value per share of their stock. Any additional equity securities could also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nWe may not satisfy The NASDAQ Capital Market's requirements for continued listing. If we cannot satisfy these requirements, NASDAQ could delist our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. To continue to be listed on NASDAQ, we are required to satisfy a number of conditions. In August 2016, we received two letters from NASDAQ, with the first letter notifying us of our failure to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 over the preceding 30 consecutive business days for our common stock. The second letter notified us of our failure to maintain a minimum of $10,000,000 in stockholders' equity as required for companies trading on The NASDAQ Global Market. In response to the second letter, we transferred our securities to The NASDAQ Capital Market in September 2016 to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders' equity requirement. On January 23, 2017, we received notification from NASDAQ that since the closing bid price of our common shares had been at $1.00 per share or greater for 10 consecutive business days, we were again in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy the NASDAQ listing requirements in the future. If we are delisted from NASDAQ, trading in our shares of common stock may be conducted, if available, on the \"OTC Bulletin Board Service\" or, if available, via another market. In the event of such delisting, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of the shares of our common stock, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of the shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could be severely limited.\nAnti-takeover provisions, our right to issue preferred stock and our agreements with Elutions could make a third party acquisition difficult.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Rights Agreement and anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company. The anti-takeover provisions, in addition to our relatively small public float, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if such transactions were in the best interest of our stockholders.\nElutions' rights under the Investment Agreement (including Elutions' right to require us to assign to Elutions certain customer contracts obtained jointly with Elutions if a competitor acquires control of us and Elutions' right of first offer to loan funds to us in the future if we intend to incur or assume certain indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions), could make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue an acquisition of us. In addition, in the event of a change of control of us, any shares subject to the Incentive Warrant that are \"locked in\" at the time of the change of control, i.e. a client contract or client statement of work has been signed, shall immediately vest. By potentially discouraging initiation of any such unsolicited takeover attempts or acquisition proposals, Elutions' increased ownership position and other rights may limit the opportunity for our stockholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or acquisition proposals.", "PERMNO": 87424, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "CRTN"}
