{"cik": "1593034", "company": "Endo International plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and we face competition in both our U.S. and international branded and generic pharmaceutical business. Competitive factors include, without limitation, product development, technological innovation, safety, efficacy, commercialization, marketing, promotion, product quality, price, cost-effectiveness, reputation, service, patient convenience and access to scientific and technical information. Many of our competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater resources than we do and we cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of competitors\u2019 products and commercialization strategies. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry include market consolidation, which may further concentrate financial, technical and market strength and increase competitive pressure in the industry. It is possible that our competitors may make greater R&D investments and have more efficient or superior processes and systems and more experience in the development of new products that permit them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demand which may make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. If we fail to compete successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our branded products do not currently compete with on-market generic products but are likely to face generic competition in the future. While the entrance of generic competitors could occur at any time and cannot be predicted with certainty, generic competition often follows shortly after the loss of patent protection. See \u201cPatents, Trademarks, Licenses and Proprietary Property\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 of this report \u201cBusiness\u201d for additional information. Similarly, generic products we currently sell with generic exclusivity could in the future be subject to competition from other generic competitors. Some of our other products, including both branded and generic products, already face generic competition. For these products, we face the risk of additional generic competitors entering the market. Manufacturers of generic products typically invest far less in R&D than research-based companies. Additionally, generic competitors, including Asian or other overseas generic competitors, may be able to produce products at costs lower than us. For these reasons, competitors may be able to price their products lower than we can, and such differences could be material. Due to lower prices, generic versions, where available, may be substituted by pharmacies or required in preference to branded versions under third-party reimbursement programs. As a result, generic competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Legislation encouraging early and rapid approval of generic drugs could also increase the degree of generic competition we face. See the risk factor \u201cIf other pharmaceutical companies use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic, over-the-counter or other competing versions of our drugs, our sales may suffer\u201d for more information.\nIn addition, our generics business faces competition from brand-name pharmaceutical companies, which have taken and may continue to take aggressive steps to thwart or delay competition from generic equivalents of their brand-name products, including bringing litigation alleging patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The actions taken by competing brand-name pharmaceutical companies may increase the costs and risks associated with our efforts to introduce generic products and may delay or prevent such introduction altogether. For example, if a brand-name pharmaceutical company\u2019s patent was held to be valid and infringed by our generic products in a particular jurisdiction, we would be required to either obtain a license from the patent holder or delay or cease the manufacture and sale of such generic product. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sales may also suffer as a result of changes in consumer demand for our products, including as a result of fluctuations in consumer buying patterns, changes in market conditions or actions taken by our competitors, including the introduction of new products or price reductions for existing products. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf other pharmaceutical companies use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic, over-the-counter or other competing versions of our drugs, our sales may suffer.\nVarious manufacturers have filed ANDAs seeking FDA approval for generic versions of certain of our key pharmaceutical products including, but not limited to, LIDODERM\u00ae, VASOSTRICT\u00ae, ADRENALIN\u00ae and AVEED\u00ae. In connection with such filings, these manufacturers have challenged the validity and/or enforceability of one or more of the underlying patents protecting our products. In the case of LIDODERM\u00ae, we no longer have patent protection in the markets where we sell these products. Our revenues from LIDODERM\u00ae have been negatively affected by multiple competing generic versions of LIDODERM\u00ae. We anticipate that these revenues could decrease further should one or more additional generic versions of LIDODERM\u00ae launch.\nAdditionally, in early 2019, we received notice from a competing pharmaceutical company that manufactures one of our products of its intent to seek approval to launch a competing OTC version of such product. We cannot predict whether this, or any other manufacturer, will take similar actions with respect to other products. Any launch of competing OTC versions of any of our products could decrease the revenue of such products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur practice is to vigorously defend and pursue all available legal and regulatory avenues in defense of the intellectual property rights protecting our products. Despite our efforts, litigation is inherently uncertain, and we cannot predict the timing or outcome of our efforts. If we are not successful in defending our intellectual property rights or opt to settle, or if a product\u2019s marketing or data exclusivity rights expire or become otherwise unenforceable, our competitors could ultimately launch generic, biosimilar, OTC or other competing versions of our products. Upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of our products, or upon the \u201cat-risk\u201d launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products, our sales and revenues of the affected products would likely decline rapidly and materially, which could require us to write off a portion or all of the intangible assets associated with the affected product and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the case of VASOSTRICT\u00ae, beginning in April 2018, Par Sterile Products, LLC (PSP LLC) and Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (PPI) received notice letters from Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eagle), Sandoz, Inc., Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC, American Regent and Fresenius advising of the filing by such companies of ANDAs for generic versions of VASOSTRICT\u00ae (vasopressin IV solution (infusion)). The Paragraph IV notices refer to patents that we have listed in the Orange Book covering either vasopressin-containing pharmaceutical compositions or methods of using a vasopressin-containing dosage form to increase blood pressure in humans. Beginning in May 2018, PPI, PSP LLC and Endo Par Innovation Company, LLC (EPIC) filed lawsuits against the companies in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and New Jersey within the 45-day deadline to invoke a 30-month stay of FDA approval pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman legislative framework. We intend to pursue all available legal, business and regulatory avenues in defense of VASOSTRICT\u00ae, including enforcement of our intellectual property rights. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful. If a generic version of VASOSTRICT\u00ae were introduced to the market, our revenues from VASOSTRICT\u00ae would decrease significantly and, depending on the timing of such introduction and its effect on VASOSTRICT\u00ae pricing, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are currently ongoing legal proceedings brought by us and/or our subsidiaries and, in certain cases, our third party partners, against manufacturers seeking FDA approval for generic versions of our products. For a description of the material related legal proceedings, see Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nWe also believe it is likely that manufacturers may seek FDA approvals for generic, OTC or other competing versions of other of our key pharmaceutical products, either through the filing of ANDAs, through the OTC monograph process or through the use of other means. We cannot determine what effect section 610 of the FCAA 2020 may have on manufacturers developing generic, OTC or other competing versions of our products.\nIf pharmacies or outsourcing facilities produce compounded versions of our products, our sales may suffer.\nCompounded drugs do not typically require the same R&D investments as either branded or generic drugs and, therefore, can compete favorably on price with both branded and generic versions of a drug. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1. While we have successfully challenged an FDA interim policy that would have permitted the compounding of vasopressin, the active ingredient in VASOSTRICT\u00ae, the introduction of compounded versions of our products by pharmacies or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to successfully identify and develop additional branded and generic pharmaceutical products, obtain and maintain exclusive marketing rights for our branded and generic products or fail to introduce branded and generic products on a timely basis, our revenues, gross margin and operating results may decline.\nOur financial results depend, to a significant extent, upon our ability, and the ability of our partners, to identify, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, launch and commercialize a pipeline of commercially successful branded and generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities. Due to the significant competition we face and the importance of being the first (or one of the first) to market, no assurances can be given that we will be able to develop, introduce and maintain commercially successful products in the future. For example, in the case of colchicine tablets, the authorized generic of Takeda\u2019s Colcrys\u00ae, we could face competition from Mylan and other manufacturers. In November 2019, Mylan launched its generic version of Colcrys\u00ae but agreed to temporarily suspend its sales pending the outcome of preliminary injunction proceedings in the litigation by Takeda against Mylan. If Mylan or other manufacturers enter the market, our revenues from colchicine tablets could decrease significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIdentifying and developing additional product candidates are prone to risks of failure inherent in product development. We conduct R&D to enable us to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in accordance with specific government regulations. Much of our product development effort is focused on technically difficult-to-formulate products and/or products that require advanced manufacturing technology. Typically, expenses related to research, development and regulatory approval of compounds for our branded products are significantly greater than those expenses associated with generic products. Should we expand our R&D efforts, our research expenses are likely to increase. Because of the inherent risk associated with R&D efforts in the healthcare industry, particularly with respect to new products, our R&D expenditures may not result in the successful regulatory approval and introduction of new products and failure in the development of any new product can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. Also, after we submit a regulatory application, the relevant governmental health authority may require that we conduct additional studies, including, for example, studies to assess the product\u2019s interaction with alcohol. As a result, we may be unable to reasonably predict the total R&D costs to develop a particular product and there is a significant risk that the funds we invest in R&D will not generate financial returns. In addition, our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate as the amount we spend to research and develop, commercialize, acquire or license new products, technologies and businesses changes.\nThe process of developing and obtaining regulatory approvals for new products is time-consuming, costly and inherently unpredictable. Even if we are able to identify and develop additional product candidates, we may fail to obtain exclusive marketing rights, such as the 180-day ANDA first-filer marketing exclusivity period provided for in the Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FFDCA or the 180-day exclusivity for competitive generic therapies (CGTs) established by the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, for such product candidates. Even if we were to secure such exclusivities, risks associated with securing timely approval, as well as risks of unfavorable litigation dispositions, put such exclusivities at risk of being forfeited. The approval of our ANDAs may also be stayed by the FDA for up to 30 months if such ANDAs become the subject of patent litigation. Even where we are awarded marketing exclusivity, we may be required to share our exclusivity period with other ANDA applicants or with authorized generics that are not prohibited from sale during the 180-day marketing exclusivity period. Our revenues have historically included sales of generic products with limited competition resulting from marketing exclusivity or other factors, and the failure to timely and effectively file any NDA, ANDA, BLA or Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) with the FDA or similar filings with other regulatory agencies, or to partner with parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, the successful commercialization of a product is subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness, ease of use and safety of our products as compared to existing products;\n\u2022\ncustomer demand and the willingness of physicians and customers to adopt our products over products with which they may have more loyalty or familiarity and overcoming any biases towards competitors\u2019 products or against our products;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our products compared to alternative products and the pricing and commercialization strategies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe success of our launch and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about us, our products, our competitors and their products or the industry as a whole or favorable publicity about competitors or their products;\n\u2022\nthe advent of new and innovative alternative products;\n\u2022\nany unforeseen issues or adverse developments in connection with our products and any resulting litigation, regulatory scrutiny and/or harm to our reputation; and\n\u2022\nother risks that may be out of our control, including the decision by a collaboration partner to make substantial changes to a product\u2019s formulation or design, or a collaboration partner refusing to perform its obligations under our collaboration agreement, which may cause delays and additional costs in developing and marketing a product.\nWe have been, continue to be and may be the subject of lawsuits, product liability claims, other significant legal proceedings, government investigations or product recalls.\nOur business exposes us to significant potential risks from lawsuits, product liability claims, other significant legal proceedings, government investigations or product recalls, including, but not limited to, such matters associated with the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of our products. Some plaintiffs have received substantial damage awards or settlements against healthcare companies based upon various legal theories, including without limitation claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. We have been, continue to be and may be subject to various product liability cases, as well as other significant legal proceedings and government investigations.\nFor example, we, along with other manufacturers of prescription opioid medications, as well as distributors and other sellers of such medications, are the subject of lawsuits and have received subpoenas and other requests for information from various federal, state and local government agencies regarding the sale, marketing and/or distribution of prescription opioid medications. Numerous claims against opioid manufacturers, including us, have been and may continue to be filed by or on behalf of states, counties, cities, Native American tribes, other government-related persons or entities, hospitals, health systems, unions, health and welfare funds, other third-party payers and/or individuals. See Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for more information. In these cases, plaintiffs seek various remedies, including without limitation declaratory and/or injunctive relief; compensatory, punitive and/or treble damages; restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties, abatement, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and/or other relief. Settlement demands may seek significant monetary and other remedies, or otherwise be on terms that we do not consider reasonable under the circumstances. Awards against and settlements by our competitors could also incentivize parties to bring additional claims against us. In addition to the risks of direct expenditures for defense costs, settlements and/or judgments in connection with these claims, proceedings and investigations, there is a possibility of loss of revenues, injunctions and disruption of business. Furthermore, we and other manufacturers of prescription opioid medications have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to negative publicity and press, which could harm our brand and the demand for our products. In addition, current or future regulatory and legislative proposals could impact us and other manufacturers of prescription opioid medications. See the risk factor \u201cOur business and financial condition may be adversely affected by legislation\u201d for more information.\nOur current and former products may cause or appear to cause serious adverse side effects or potentially dangerous drug interactions if misused or improperly prescribed or as a result of faulty surgical technique. For example, we and certain other manufacturers have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury resulting from use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The FDA held a public advisory committee meeting in February 2019 during which the members of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee discussed and made recommendations regarding the safety and effectiveness of surgical mesh to treat POP. In April 2019, following the meeting, the FDA ordered that the manufacturers of all remaining surgical mesh products indicated for the transvaginal repair of POP cease selling and distributing their products in the U.S. effective immediately. Although we have not sold transvaginal surgical mesh products since March 2016, it is possible that the FDA\u2019s order and any additional FDA actions based on the outcome of the advisory committee meeting could result in additional litigation against the Company. See Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for more information.\nAny failure to effectively identify, analyze, report and protect adverse event data and/or to fully comply with relevant laws, rules and regulations around adverse event reporting could expose the Company to legal proceedings, penalties, fines and/or reputational damage.\nIn addition, in the age of social media, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have a wide variety of tools to advertise their services and solicit new clients for litigation, including using judgments and settlements obtained in litigation against us or other pharmaceutical companies as an advertising tool. For these or other reasons, any significant product liability or mass tort litigation in which we are a defendant could have a larger number of plaintiffs than such actions have seen historically and we could also see an increase in the number of cases filed against us because of the increasing use of widespread and media-varied advertising. Furthermore, a ruling against other pharmaceutical companies in product liability or mass tort litigation in which we are not a defendant could have a negative impact on pending litigation where we are a defendant.\nIn addition, in certain circumstances, such as in the case of products that do not meet approved specifications or for which subsequent data demonstrate such products may be unsafe, ineffective or misused, it may be necessary for us to initiate voluntary or mandatory recalls or withdraw such products from the market. Any such recall or withdrawal could result in adverse publicity, costs connected to the recall and loss of revenue. Adverse publicity could also result in an increased number of additional product liability claims, whether or not these claims have a basis in scientific fact. See the risk factor \u201cPublic concern around the abuse of opioids or other products, including without limitation law enforcement concerns over diversion or marketing practices, regulatory efforts to combat abuse, and litigation could result in costs to our business\u201d for more information.\nIf we are found liable in any lawsuits, including product liability claims or actions related to our sales, marketing or pricing practices or the sale, marketing and/or distribution of prescription opioid medications, or if we are subject to government investigations or product recalls, it could result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, fines, reputational harm, civil lawsuits, criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs. We may also voluntarily settle cases even if we believe that we have meritorious defenses because of the significant legal and other costs that may be required to defend such actions. Any judgments, claims, settlements and related costs could be well in excess of any applicable insurance. As a result, we may experience significant negative impacts on our operations. To satisfy judgments or settlements, we also may need to seek financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, when required. Judgments also could cause defaults under our debt agreements and/or restrictions on our product use and we could incur losses as a result. Any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe occurrence or possibility of any such result may cause us to pursue one or more significant corporate transactions as well as other remedial measures, including internal reorganizations, restructuring activities, strategic corporate alignments, cost-saving initiatives or asset sales. See the risk factor \u201cOur ability to fund our operations, maintain liquidity and meet our financing obligations is reliant on our operations, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties\u201d for more information. Likewise, any internal reorganizations, restructuring activities, strategic corporate alignments, cost-saving initiatives or asset sales may be complex, could entail significant costs and charges or could otherwise negatively impact shareholder value and there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that they will result in their intended benefits.\nSee Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for further discussion of the foregoing and other material legal proceedings.\nWe may not have and may be unable to obtain or maintain insurance adequate to cover potential liabilities.\nWe may not have and may be unable to obtain or maintain in the future insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities or other losses, such as the cost of a recall, if any claim is brought against us, regardless of the success or failure of the claim. For example, we generally no longer have product liability insurance to cover the claims in connection with the mesh-related litigation described above. Additionally, we may be limited by the surviving insurance policies of our acquired subsidiaries, which may not be adequate to cover against potential liabilities or other losses. Even where claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity, there can be no assurance that the claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to obtain other financing could affect our ability to pay the amounts due under those liabilities not covered by insurance.\nOur ability to fund our operations, maintain liquidity and meet our financing obligations is reliant on our operations, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\nWe rely on cash from operations as well as access to the financial markets to fund our operations, maintain liquidity and meet our financial obligations. Our operations are subject to many significant risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including those related to generic competition and legal challenges that could impact our key products, including VASOSTRICT\u00ae, outstanding and future legal proceedings and governmental investigations, including those related to our sale, marketing and/or distribution of prescription opioid medications, and others. Any negative development or outcome in connection with any or all of these risks and uncertainties could result in significant consequences, including one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncausing a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of legal or related expenses and therefore unavailable for other purposes, including the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, causing us to be more vulnerable to periods of negative or slow growth in the general economy or in our business, causing us to be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth and placing us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\ncausing us to be unable to maintain compliance with or making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under certain of our outstanding debt obligations, causing a downgrade of our debt and long-term corporate ratings (which could increase our cost of capital) and exposing us to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our subsidiaries\u2019 outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to incur additional borrowings under the covenants in our then-existing facilities or to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, business development, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes, or to refinance our indebtedness; and/or\n\u2022\notherwise causing us to be unable to fund our operations and liquidity needs, such as future capital expenditures and payment of our indebtedness.\nThe occurrence or possibility of one or more of these or similar events may cause us to pursue one or more significant corporate transactions as well as other remedial measures, including refinancing all or part of our then-existing indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking to raise additional capital or pursuing one or more internal reorganizations, restructuring activities, strategic corporate alignments, cost-saving initiatives or asset sales. Any refinancing of our substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, which will depend on the conditions of the markets and our financial condition at such time, and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Any refinancing may also increase the amount of our secured indebtedness. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. Likewise, any internal reorganizations, restructuring activities, strategic corporate alignments, cost-saving initiatives or asset sales may be complex, could entail significant costs and charges or could otherwise negatively impact shareholder value and there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that they will result in their intended benefits.\nOur ability to protect and maintain our proprietary and licensed third party technology, which is vital to our business, is uncertain.\nOur success, competitive position and future income will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our partners and suppliers, to obtain and protect patent and other intellectual property rights relating to our current and future technologies, processes and products. The degree of protection any patents will afford is uncertain, including whether the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all the jurisdictions where we conduct business. That is, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its claimed scope, validity or enforceability. Patent rights may be challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented by third parties. For example, if an invention qualifies as a joint invention, the joint inventor may have intellectual property rights in the invention, which it might not protect. A third party may also infringe upon, design around or develop uses not covered by any patent issued or licensed to us and our patents may not otherwise be commercially viable. In this regard, the patent position of pharmaceutical compounds and compositions is particularly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Even issued patents may later be modified or revoked by the PTO, by comparable foreign patent offices or by a court following legal proceedings. Laws relating to such rights may in the future also be changed or withdrawn.\nThere is no assurance that any of our patent claims in our pending non-provisional and provisional patent applications relating to our technologies, processes or products will be issued or, if issued, that any of our existing and future patent claims will be held valid and enforceable against third-party infringement. It is possible that we could incur significant costs and management distraction if we are required to initiate litigation against others to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Such patent disputes may be lengthy and a potential violator of our patents may bring a potentially infringing product to market during the dispute, subjecting us to competition and damages due to infringement of the competitor product. Upon the expiration or loss of intellectual property protection for a product, others may manufacture and distribute such patented product, which may result in the loss of a significant portion of our sales of that product.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information, which we generally seek to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and partners. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. For example, in August 2017, we filed a complaint against QuVa Pharma, Inc. (QuVa) and certain individual defendants in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging misappropriation in violation of the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act, New Jersey Trade Secrets Act and New Jersey common law, as well as unfair competition, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty of loyalty, tortious interference with contractual relations and breach of the duty of confidence in connection with VASOSTRICT\u00ae. For more information regarding this litigation, see Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Even if third parties misappropriate or infringe upon our proprietary rights, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any such unauthorized use and we may not be able to prevent third parties from misappropriating or infringing upon our proprietary rights. In addition, if our employees, scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to our existing products or products under development, such inventions and processes will not necessarily become our property and may remain the property of those persons or their employers.\nAny failure by us to adequately protect our technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how or to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur competitors or other third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property, forcing us to expend substantial resources in litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Any unfavorable outcome of such litigation, including losses related to \u201cat-risk\u201d product launches, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompanies that produce branded pharmaceutical products routinely bring litigation against ANDA or similar applicants that seek regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of branded products, alleging patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Patent holders may also bring patent infringement suits against companies that are currently marketing and selling approved generic products. Litigation often involves significant expense. Additionally, if the patents of others are held valid, enforceable and infringed by our current products or future product candidates, we would, unless we could obtain a license from the patent holder, need to delay selling our corresponding generic product and, if we are already selling our product, cease selling and potentially destroy existing product stock. Additionally, we could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties and we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThere may be situations in which we may make business and legal judgments to market and sell products that are subject to claims of alleged patent infringement prior to final resolution of those claims by the courts based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable or are not infringed by our marketing and sale of such products. This is commonly referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an \u201cat-risk\u201d launch. The risk involved in an at-risk launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails against us, the remedies available to such holder may include, among other things, damages calculated based on the profits lost by the patent holder, which can be significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product. Moreover, if a court determines that such infringement is willful, the damages could be subject to trebling. We could face substantial damages from adverse court decisions in such matters. We could also be at risk for the value of such inventory that we are unable to market or sell.\nAgreements between branded pharmaceutical companies and generic pharmaceutical companies are facing increased government scrutiny and private litigation in the U.S. and abroad.\nWe are and may in the future be involved in patent litigations in which generic companies challenge the validity or enforceability of our products\u2019 listed patents and/or the applicability of these patents to the generic applicant\u2019s products. Likewise, we are and may in the future be involved in patent litigations in which we challenge the validity or enforceability of innovator companies\u2019 listed patents and/or their applicability to our generic products. Therefore, settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be part of our business. Parties to such settlement agreements in the U.S., including us, are required by law to file them with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ for review. In some instances, the FTC has brought actions against brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements, alleging that they violate antitrust laws. Even in the absence of an FTC challenge, other governmental or private litigants may assert antitrust or other claims relating to such agreements. Accordingly, we may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC or other governmental entities for information about any such settlement agreement we enter into, and there is a risk that the FTC or other governmental or private litigants may commence an action against us alleging violation of antitrust laws or other claims.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, in FTC v. Actavis, determined that patent settlement agreements between generic and brand companies should be evaluated under the rule of reason, but provided limited guidance beyond the selection of this standard. Because the Supreme Court did not articulate the full range of criteria upon which a determination of the legality of such settlements would be based, or provide guidance on the precise circumstances under which such settlements would qualify as legal, there may be extensive litigation over what constitutes a reasonable and lawful patent settlement between a brand and generic company. For example, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to multiple lawsuits, including proposed class actions, brought by direct and indirect purchasers alleging that a patent settlement agreement with Impax Laboratories, LLC (now Amneal) regarding OPANA\u00ae ER was unlawful in violation of federal antitrust laws and various state laws.\nThere have been federal and state legislative efforts to overturn the FTC v. Actavis decision and make certain terms in patent settlement agreements per se unlawful. For example, some members of the U.S. Congress have proposed legislation that would limit the types of settlement agreements generic manufacturers and brand companies can enter into. The state of California recently enacted legislation, effective January 1, 2020, that deems a settlement of a patent infringement claim to be presumptively anticompetitive and allows the California Attorney General to seek monetary penalties if a generic company receives anything of value from the branded company and the generic company agrees to delay research and development, manufacturing, marketing or sales of the generic product for any period of time. The California law carves out from the definition of \u201canything of value\u201d certain types of settlement terms and it allows the settling parties to rebut the presumption of anticompetitive harm.\nWe have significant goodwill and other intangible assets. Consequently, potential impairments of goodwill and other intangibles may significantly impact our profitability.\nGoodwill and other intangibles represent a significant portion of our assets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill and other intangibles comprised approximately 66% and 71%, respectively, of our total assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests at least annually. Additionally, impairment tests must be performed for certain assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets\u2019 carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded asset impairment charges of $0.5 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, which related primarily to goodwill and other intangible assets. Refer to Note 10. Goodwill and Other Intangibles in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for examples and a discussion of material impairment tests and impairment charges during the years ended years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The procedures and assumptions used in our goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing are discussed in Part II, Item 7 of this report \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the caption \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d and in Note 10. Goodwill and Other Intangibles in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nEvents giving rise to asset impairments are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and often cannot be predicted. As a result of the significance of goodwill and other intangible assets, our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should additional impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets occur.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to the marketing of our products and services.\nThe marketing and pricing of our products and services, including product promotion, educational activities, support of continuing medical education programs and other interactions with healthcare professionals, are governed by various laws and regulations, including FDA regulations and the Anti-Kickback Statute. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, without identical exceptions or exemptions. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such regulations or requirements could be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, could delay our introduction of new products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, it is unclear at this time whether the October Proposed Rule revising safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to, among other things, add new safe harbors for certain value-based arrangements, will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, it would have on the cost of complying with and our ability to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or on our business. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1.\nSanctions for violating these laws include criminal penalties and civil sanctions and possible exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid as well as potential liability under the False Claims Act and applicable state false claims acts. There can be no assurance that our practices will not be challenged under these laws in the future, that changes in these laws or interpretation of these laws would not give rise to new challenges of our practices or that any such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Law enforcement agencies sometimes initiate investigations into sales, marketing and/or pricing practices based on preliminary information or evidence, and such investigations can be and often are closed without any enforcement action. Nevertheless, these types of investigations and any related litigation can result in: (i) large expenditures of cash for legal fees, payment of penalties and compliance activities; (ii) limitations on operations; (iii) diversion of management resources; (iv) injury to our reputation; and (v) decreased demand for our products.\nThe FFDCA and FDA regulations and guidance restrict the ability of healthcare companies, such as our company, to communicate with patients, physicians and other third-parties about uses of prescription pharmaceuticals or devices that are not cleared or approved by the FDA, which are commonly referred to as \u201coff-label\u201d uses. Prohibitions on the promotion of off-label uses and against promotional practices deemed false or misleading are actively enforced by various parties at both the federal and state level. A company that is found to have improperly promoted its products under these laws may be subject to significant liability, including significant administrative, civil and criminal sanctions including, but not limited to, significant civil damages, criminal fines and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Applicable laws governing product promotion also provide for administrative, civil and criminal liability for individuals, including, in some circumstances, potential strict vicarious liability. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct.\nWe have established and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to prevent, detect and correct violations of state and federal healthcare laws, including laws related to advertising and promotion of our products. Nonetheless, enforcement agencies or private plaintiffs may take the position that we are not in compliance with such requirements and, if such non-compliance is proven, the Company and, in some cases, individual employees, may be subject to significant liability, including the aforementioned administrative, civil and criminal sanctions.\nIn February 2014, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (EPI) entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement and a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to resolve allegations regarding the promotion of LIDODERM\u00ae. In March 2013, our subsidiary Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (PPCI) entered into a CIA and plea agreement with the DOJ to resolve allegations regarding the promotion of MEGACE\u00ae ES, which was subsequently subsumed by EPI\u2019s CIA. Those agreements placed certain obligations on us related to the marketing of our pharmaceutical products and our healthcare regulatory compliance program, including reporting requirements to the U.S. government, detailed requirements for our compliance program, code of conduct and policies and procedures and the requirement to engage an Independent Review Organization. We have implemented procedures and practices to comply with the CIAs, including the engagement of an Independent Review Organization. In February 2020, Endo was notified that it had satisfied its CIA requirements and the 5-year term of Endo\u2019s CIA has now concluded.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business, including withdrawal or suspension of existing products.\nGovernmental authorities including without limitation the FDA impose substantial requirements on the development, manufacture, holding, labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of therapeutic pharmaceutical products. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1.\nRegulatory approvals for the sale of any new product candidate may require preclinical studies and clinical trials that such product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use. Preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate. Likewise, we may not be able to demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate\u2019s therapeutic benefits outweigh its risks. Even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale trials. A failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy would result in our failure to obtain regulatory approvals. Clinical trials can be delayed for reasons outside of our control, which can lead to increased development costs and delays in regulatory approval. For example, there is substantial competition to enroll patients in clinical trials, and such competition has delayed clinical development of our products in the past. For example, patients could enroll in clinical trials more slowly than expected or could drop out before or during clinical trials. In addition, we may rely on collaboration partners that may control or make changes in trial protocol and design enhancements, or encounter clinical trial compliance-related issues, which may also delay clinical trials. Product supplies may be delayed or be insufficient to treat the patients participating in the clinical trials and manufacturers or suppliers may not meet the requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, such as those relating to cGMP. We also may experience delays in obtaining, or we may not obtain, required initial and continuing approval of our clinical trials from institutional review boards. We may experience delays or undesired results in any of our clinical trials.\nCompliance with clinical trial requirements and cGMP regulations requires significant expenditures and the dedication of substantial resources. The FDA may place a hold on a clinical trial and may cause a suspension or withdrawal of product approvals if regulatory standards are not maintained. In the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug is required by the FDA to curtail or cease operations, or otherwise becomes inoperable, or a third party contract manufacturing facility faces manufacturing problems, obtaining the required FDA authorization to manufacture at the same or a different manufacturing site could result in production delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional delays may result if an FDA advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees, it usually does. A negative advisory committee meeting could signal a lower likelihood of approval, although the FDA may still end up approving our application. Regardless of an advisory committee meeting outcome or the FDA\u2019s final approval decision, public presentation of our data may shed positive or negative light on our application.\nWe may seek FDA approval for certain unapproved marketed products through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1. Even if we receive approval for an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA, the FDA may not take timely enforcement action against companies marketing unapproved versions of the product; therefore, we cannot be sure that that we will receive the benefit of any de facto exclusive marketing period or that we will fully recoup the expenses incurred to obtain an approval. In addition, certain competitors and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2).\nThe ANDA approval process for a new product varies in time, generally requiring a minimum of 10 months following submission of the ANDA to FDA, but could also take several years from the date of application. The timing for the ANDA approval process for generic products is difficult to estimate and can vary significantly. ANDA approvals, if granted, may not include all uses (known as indications) for which a company may seek to market a product.\nThe submission of an NDA, Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA), ANDA, BLA or sBLA to the FDA with supporting clinical safety and efficacy data does not guarantee that the FDA will grant approval to market the product. Meeting the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements to obtain approval to market a drug product, which vary substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate, typically takes years, if approved at all, and is subject to uncertainty. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Any approval by regulatory agencies may subject the marketing of our products to certain limits on indicated use. For example, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we may request, may grant approval contingent on conditions such as the performance and results of costly post-marketing clinical trials or REMS or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Additionally, reimbursement by government payers or other payers may not be approved at the price we intend to charge for our products. Any limitation on use imposed by the FDA or delay in or failure to obtain FDA approvals or clearances of products developed by us would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue. We could also be at risk for the value of any capitalized pre-launch inventories related to products under development. The factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOnce a product is approved or cleared for marketing, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals or clearances; seizures or recalls of products; injunctions against the manufacture, holding, distribution, marketing and sale of a product; and civil and criminal sanctions. For example, any failure to effectively identify, analyze, report and protect adverse event data and/or to fully comply with relevant laws, rules and regulations around adverse event reporting could expose the Company to legal proceedings, penalties, fines and reputational damage. Furthermore, changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory approvals or clearances. Meeting regulatory requirements and evolving government standards may delay marketing of our new products for a considerable period of time, impose costly procedures upon our activities and result in a competitive advantage to other companies that compete against us.\nIn addition, after a product is approved or cleared for marketing, new data and information, including information about product misuse or abuse at the user level, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or patient or trade organizations to recommend or publish guidance or guidelines related to the use of our products, which may lead to reduced sales of our products. For example, in May 2016, an FDA advisory panel recommended mandatory training of all physicians who prescribe opioids on the risks of prescription opioids. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued a guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain that provides recommendations for primary care clinicians prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care and end-of-life care. In addition, state health departments and boards of pharmacy have authority to regulate distribution and may modify their regulations with respect to prescription opioid medications in an attempt to curb abuse. These or any new regulations or requirements could be difficult and expensive for us to comply with and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe FDA scheduled a Joint Meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee in March 2017 to discuss pre- and post-marketing data about the abuse of OPANA\u00ae ER and the overall risk-benefit of this product. The advisory committees were also scheduled to discuss abuse of generic oxymorphone ER and oxymorphone immediate-release products. In March 2017, the advisory committees voted 18 to eight, with one abstention, that the benefits of reformulated OPANA\u00ae ER no longer outweigh its risks. While several of the advisory committee members acknowledged the role of OPANA\u00ae ER in clinical practice, others believed its benefits were overshadowed by the continuing public health concerns around the product\u2019s misuse, abuse and diversion. In June 2017, the FDA requested that we voluntarily withdraw OPANA\u00ae ER from the market and, in July 2017, after careful consideration and consultation with the FDA, we decided to voluntarily remove OPANA\u00ae ER from the market to the Company\u2019s financial detriment. During the second quarter of 2017, we began to work with the FDA to coordinate an orderly withdrawal of the product from the market. By September 1, 2017, we ceased shipments of OPANA\u00ae ER to customers and we expect the NDA will be withdrawn. These actions had an adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result of these actions, we incurred certain charges. Actions similar to these, such as recalls or withdrawals, could divert management time and attention, reduce market acceptance of all of our products, harm our reputation, reduce our revenues, lead to additional charges or expenses or result in product liability claims, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBased on scientific developments, post-market experience, legislative or regulatory changes or other factors, the current FDA standards of review for approving new pharmaceutical products, or new indications or uses for approved or cleared products, are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past.\nSome new or evolving FDA review standards or conditions for approval or clearance were not applied to many established products currently on the market, including certain opioid products. As a result, the FDA does not have safety databases on these products that are as extensive as some products developed more recently. Accordingly, we believe the FDA has expressed an intention to develop such databases for certain of these products, including many opioids. In particular, the FDA has expressed interest in specific chemical structures that may be present as impurities in a number of opioid narcotic APIs, such as oxycodone, which, based on certain structural characteristics and laboratory tests, may indicate the potential for having mutagenic effects. The FDA has required, and may continue to require, more stringent controls of the levels of these or other impurities in products.\nAlso, the FDA may require labeling revisions, formulation or manufacturing changes and/or product modifications for new or existing products containing impurities. More stringent requirements, together with any additional testing or remedial measures that may be necessary, could result in increased costs for, or delays in, obtaining approvals. Although we do not believe that the FDA would seek to remove a currently marketed product from the market unless the effects of alleged impurities are believed to indicate a significant risk to patient health, we cannot make any such assurance.\nThe FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority under the FFDCA could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. For example, in 2015, the FDA sent letters to a number of manufacturers, including Endo, requiring that a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial be conducted to evaluate the effect of TRT on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in men. The letter received by Endo required that we include new safety information in the labeling and Medication Guide for certain prescription medications containing testosterone, such as TESTIM\u00ae.\nPost-marketing studies and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may adversely affect sales of our products. Furthermore, the discovery of significant safety or efficacy concerns or problems with a product in the same therapeutic class as one of our products that implicate or appear to implicate the entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of our product or, in some cases, result in product withdrawals. The FDA has continuing authority over the approval of an NDA, ANDA or BLA and may withdraw approval if, among other reasons, post-marketing clinical or other experience, tests or data show that a product is unsafe for use under the conditions upon which it was approved or licensed, or if FDA determines that there is a lack of substantial evidence of the product\u2019s efficacy under the conditions described in its labeling.\nIn addition to the FDA and other U.S. regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies may have authority over various aspects of our business and may impose additional requirements and costs. Similar to other healthcare companies, our facilities in multiple countries across the full range of our business units are subject to routine and new-product related inspections by regulatory authorities including the FDA, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and Health Canada. In the past, some of these inspections have resulted in inspection observations (including FDA Form 483 observations). We have responded to all inspection observations within the required timeframe and have implemented, or are continuing to implement, the corrective action plans as agreed with the relevant regulatory agencies. Future inspections may result in additional inspection observations or other corrective actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSeveral of our core products contain controlled substances. Stringent DEA and other governmental regulations on our use of controlled substances include restrictions on their use in research, manufacture, distribution and storage. A breach of these regulations could result in imposition of civil penalties, refusal to renew or action to revoke necessary registrations, or other restrictions on operations involving controlled substances. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal requirements could subject the manufacturing facilities of our subsidiaries and manufacturing partners to possible legal or regulatory action, including shutdown. Any such shutdown may adversely affect their ability to manufacture or supply product and thus, our ability to market affected products. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also the risk described under the caption \u201cThe DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our products as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials.\u201d\nIn addition, we are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) enacted by the U.S. government, which requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription product at the salable unit level through the distribution system. The DSCSA will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period from its enactment on November 27, 2013. Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements could require significant capital expenditures, increase our operating costs and impose significant administrative burdens.\nWe cannot determine what effect changes in laws, regulations or legal interpretations or requirements by the FDA, the courts or others, when and if promulgated or issued, or advisory committee meetings may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require expanded or different labeling, additional testing, monitoring of patients, interaction with physicians, education programs for patients or physicians, curtailment of necessary supplies, limitations on product distribution, the recall or discontinuance of certain products and additional recordkeeping. Any such changes could result in additional litigation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory science and regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that, from time to time, we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite our ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.\nThe success of our acquisition and licensing strategy is subject to uncertainty and acquisitions or licenses may reduce our earnings, be difficult to integrate, not perform as expected or require us to obtain additional financing.\nWe regularly evaluate selective acquisitions and look to continue to enhance our product line by acquiring rights to additional products and compounds. Such acquisitions may be carried out through corporate acquisitions, asset acquisitions, licensing or joint venture arrangements. However, we may not be able to complete acquisitions, obtain licenses or enter into arrangements that meet our target criteria on satisfactory terms, if at all. For example, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates. In addition, any acquisition of assets and rights to products and compounds may fail to accomplish our strategic objective and may not perform as expected. Further, if we are unable to maintain, on commercially reasonable terms, product, compound or other licenses that we have acquired, our ability to develop or commercialize our products may be inhibited. In order to continue to develop and broaden our product range, we must compete to acquire assets. Our competitors may have greater resources than us and therefore be better able to complete acquisitions or licenses, which could cause us to be unable to consummate acquisitions, licensing agreements or cause the ultimate price we pay to increase. If we fail to achieve our acquisition or licensing goals, our growth may be limited.\nAcquisitions of companies may expose us to additional risks, which may be beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of an acquired business into our practices and operations. Any integration process may be disruptive and may not achieve realization of expected benefits. The difficulties of combining operations of companies include, among others:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost or tax savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination of the businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\nthe impact of pre-existing legal and/or regulatory issues;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees and retention of key personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities or larger liabilities than projected;\n\u2022\nunforeseen increases to expenses or other adverse consequences associated with the transaction; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.\nIn addition, any acquisitions may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss or disruption of relationships with customers, suppliers, partners, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings.\nThe benefits of mergers and acquisitions are also subject to a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in jurisdictions in which the combined company will do business, the financial performance of the combined business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies, including changes in interest rates and tax law of the jurisdictions in which the combined company will do business. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances relating to such factors may be interrelated, and the impact to the combined company of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset or more than offset by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances relating to such factors.\nIn addition, based on current acquisition prices in the pharmaceutical industry, acquisitions could decrease our net income per share and add significant intangible assets and related amortization or impairment charges. Our acquisition strategy may require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional debt obligations, increased interest expense or dilution of equity ownership. We may not be able to finance acquisitions on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nWe may decide to sell assets, which could adversely affect our prospects and opportunities for growth.\nWe may from time to time consider selling certain assets if we determine that such assets are not critical to our strategy or we believe the opportunity to monetize the asset is attractive or for various other reasons, including for the reduction of indebtedness. For example, we divested both Litha and Somar in 2017 and various ANDAs throughout 2018 and 2019. We will continue to explore the sale of certain non-core assets. Although our expectation is to engage in asset sales only if they advance or otherwise support our overall strategy, we may be forced to sell assets in response to liquidation or other claims described herein, and any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets or our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories. As a result, any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, and we may find it difficult to maintain current price levels. Additionally, the market may not accept those products for which third party reimbursement is not adequately provided.\nOur ability to commercialize our products depends, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of these products is available from government healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare, private health insurers and others. We cannot be certain that, over time, third party reimbursements for our products will be adequate for us to maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment. Government payers, private insurers and other third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by: (i) limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement (including adjusting co-pays) for products, (ii) refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for off-label uses for products and (iii) requiring or encouraging, through more favorable reimbursement levels or otherwise, the substitution of generic alternatives to branded products.\nThe Trump Administration also has been targeting pharmaceutical prices in ways that could affect reimbursement for our products. For example, beginning in January 2020, Medicare Advantage Plans are permitted to apply \u201cstep therapy\u201d to products covered under Part B, which could impact our ability to negotiate for favorable product access in this sector. Additionally, in October 2018, President Trump announced a new initiative to contain costs by establishing an \u201cinternational pricing index\u201d that would be used as a benchmark in deciding how much to pay for Medicare Part B products. CMS issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Medicare Program that would reduce Part B spending and reimbursement in part based on the prices that manufacturers charge to customers in foreign countries (also referred to as reference pricing). This proposal targets physician-administered products. It is possible that any final rule could adversely affect reimbursement for certain products that we sell, and we cannot anticipate the adverse impact of this or similar developments on our business. Additionally, the Congress is considering multiple proposals impacting healthcare. There can be no assurance as to which proposals, if any, will be adopted, the final terms of any such proposals and the ultimate impact that such proposals would have on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The U.S. presidential election is also leading to significant policy proposals regarding healthcare and we cannot predict which policies will ultimately be adopted and how they would impact us.\nNew tariffs and evolving trade policy between the U.S. and other countries, including China, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe conduct business globally and our operations, including third party suppliers, span numerous countries outside the U.S. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and various other countries, including China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs.\nThe Trump Administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. foreign trade policy, including the possibility of imposing greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. Such tariffs could potentially disrupt our existing supply chains and impose additional costs on our business, including costs with respect to raw materials upon which our business depends. Furthermore, if tariffs, trade restrictions or trade barriers are placed on products such as ours by foreign governments, it could cause us to raise prices for our products, which may result in the loss of customers. If we are unable to pass along increased costs to our customers, our margins could be adversely affected. Additionally, it is possible further tariffs may be imposed that could affect imports of APIs and other materials used in our products, or our business may be adversely impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by other countries, including restricted access to APIs or other materials used in our products, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our products. Further, the continued threats of tariffs, trade restrictions and trade barriers could have a generally disruptive impact on the global economy and, therefore, negatively impact our sales. For example, the Trump Administration has placed tariffs on certain goods imported from China. In January 2020, the U.S. and China agreed to roll back certain tariffs, expand trade purchases and renew commitments on intellectual property, technology transfer and currency practices. Nevertheless, given the volatility and uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these tariffs and other aspects of U.S. foreign trade policy, the impact on our operations and results is uncertain and could be significant. Further governmental action related to tariffs, additional taxes, regulatory changes or other retaliatory trade measures could occur in the future. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience pricing pressure on our products due to social or political pressure, which would reduce our revenue and future profitability.\nWe may experience downward pricing pressure on our products due to social or political pressure, which would reduce our revenue and future profitability. Price increases have resulted in increased public and governmental scrutiny of the cost of pharmaceutical products. For example, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies in connection with an investigation into pricing practices conducted by the DOJ. Several state attorneys general also have commenced drug pricing investigations and filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, including PPI, and the U.S. Senate has investigated a number of pharmaceutical companies relating to price increases and pricing practices. Our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these or other inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals limiting our ability to increase or maintain the prices of our products.\nIn addition, the Trump Administration and a number of federal legislators continue to scrutinize pharmaceutical prices and are seeking ways to lower prices. For example, the Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cBlueprint\u201d on pharmaceutical prices describes a number of mechanisms for lowering manufacturer list prices and reducing patient out-of-pocket costs. Although the Blueprint contains a number of policy objectives, we cannot know the form that any new requirements will take or the effect that they may have on our business. In December 2019, the Trump Administration, through the FDA, released a proposed rule and draft guidance that set forth two pathways for the legal importation of certain pharmaceutical products in an effort to control costs. Since these pathways are not yet effective and are subject to revision pending receipt of public comments, we cannot determine what effect these pathways may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, Congress has held a number of hearings related to pharmaceutical prices and a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators introduced legislation that would require pharmaceutical manufacturers to justify certain price increases. A large number of individual states also have introduced legislation aimed at pharmaceutical pricing regulation, transparency or both. For example, California, Oregon, Vermont and Nevada have enacted such laws. Our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected by the passage of these laws or similar federal or state legislation. Pressure from social activist groups and future government regulations may also put downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products in the future.\nOur business is highly dependent upon market perceptions of us, our brands, and the safety and quality of our products and similar products, and may be adversely impacted by negative publicity or findings.\nWe are dependent on market perceptions, and negative publicity or findings associated with product quality, patient illness or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products, or similar products, or our partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMarket perceptions are very important to our business, especially market perceptions of our company and brands and the safety and quality of our products. If we, our partners and suppliers or our brands suffer negative publicity, or if any of our products or similar products are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, ineffective or harmful to consumers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor example, the pharmaceutical supply chain has been increasingly challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products that do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of API or no API at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.\nIn addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could seriously damage our reputation. The inappropriate use of certain social media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information or the improper dissemination of material non-public information.\nFurthermore, unfavorable media coverage about opioid abuse could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In recent years, opioid abuse has received a high degree of media coverage. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of oxycodone or other prescription opioid medications, the limitations of abuse-deterrent forms, public inquiries and investigations into drug abuse, including the abuse of prescription products, litigation or regulatory activity could adversely affect our reputation. Additionally, increased scrutiny of opioids generally, whether focused on our products or otherwise, could negatively impact our relationship with healthcare providers and other members of the healthcare community. Such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the potential size of the market for new or existing products and could decrease revenues and royalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and financial condition may be adversely affected by legislation.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty how existing laws may be applied or how laws or legal standards may change in the future. Current or future legislation, whether state or federal, or in any of the non-U.S. jurisdictions with authority over our operations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the effect of H.R. 6, enacted in October 2018, is still uncertain.\nIn addition, in April 2018, New York enacted a statute called the Opioid Stewardship Act (the Stewardship Act), which, among other things, provided for certain manufacturers and distributors of certain opioids in the state of New York (the Contributing Parties) to make payments to a newly created Opioid Stewardship Fund (the Fund). By its terms, the Stewardship Act required Contributing Parties to pay a combined total of up to $100 million annually into the Fund, with each Contributing Party\u2019s share based on the total amount of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) of certain opioids sold or distributed by the Contributing Party in the state of New York during the preceding calendar year, subject to potential adjustments by the New York State Department of Health. Failure of a Contributing Party to make required reports or pay its ratable share, or a Contributing Party passing on the cost of its ratable share to a purchaser, could subject the Contributing Party to penalties. In December 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York held the Stewardship Act unconstitutional. This ruling is on appeal as of February 18, 2020. If the decision is reversed, we may be deemed to be a Contributing Party under the Stewardship Act and even if we are not considered to be a Contributing Party, or such a determination is never made, other entities may attempt to seek reimbursement from Endo for payments made related to products manufactured by Endo and distributed in New York. Furthermore, the application of the Stewardship Act may require additional regulatory guidance, which could be substantially delayed, increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the Stewardship Act on us. If we are ultimately deemed to be a Contributing Party under the Stewardship Act, or similar legislation that could be enacted by New York or other jurisdictions, compliance with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the meantime, in April 2019, New York enacted an excise tax on the first sale of every opioid unit in New York at the rate of one quarter of a cent per MME where wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) is less than $0.50 and one and one half cents per MME where WAC is equal to or greater than $0.50. For purposes of this statute, \u201copioid\u201d does not include buprenorphine, methadone or morphine and \u201csale\u201d does not include transfers of title from a manufacturer in New York to a purchaser outside New York when the opioid unit will be used or consumed outside New York.\nIn October 2018, the Canadian province of British Columbia enacted a statute called the Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act, which allows the British Columbia government to file a direct action against opioid manufacturers and wholesalers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, resulting from an \u201copioid-related wrong.\u201d The statute defines \u201copioid-related wrong\u201d to include any breach of a common law, equitable or statutory duty or obligation owed to persons in British Columbia who have been or might be exposed to an opioid product. The statute, among other effects, erases limitation periods for certain claims, reverses certain burdens of proof as to causation, allows the use of population-based evidence and restricts discovery of certain documents. The provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Newfoundland enacted similar legislation in 2019 and the province of Saskatchewan has announced that it expects to pass similar legislation in 2020. It is possible that these statutes, or similar statutes enacted by other jurisdictions, and resultant litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn Canada, the prices of patented pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the PMPRB. Under the Canadian Patent Act and Patented Medicines Regulations, patentees of inventions that pertain to pharmaceutical products sold in Canada are required to file price and sales information about their patented pharmaceutical products with the PMPRB. The PMPRB reviews this information on an ongoing basis to ensure that the prices of patented pharmaceuticals sold in Canada are not excessive, based upon price tests established by the PMPRB. There is a risk that the price of our pharmaceutical products could be found to be excessive because the price as set at launch is non-compliant with the PMPRB\u2019s guidelines, or because our average sale prices over time are not compliant with the guidelines. Furthermore, amendments expected to come into force on July 1, 2020 will introduce a number of changes to the regulation of Canadian drug prices by the PMPRB. The PMPRB guidelines will be updated to introduce new price tests to account for changes introduced by the amendments. The application of the new price tests under the guidelines could result in the current prices of our pharmaceutical products being deemed to be excessive. Failure by us to comply with the current or future guidelines could ultimately result in us reducing the prices of the pharmaceutical products we sell in Canada and/or making a payment to the Canadian government to offset revenues deemed by the PMPRB to be excessive, which could ultimately reduce the revenues and cash flows of our International Pharmaceuticals segment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIt is possible that these or other changes in law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1.\nPublic concern around the abuse of opioids or other products, including without limitation law enforcement concerns over diversion or marketing practices, regulatory efforts to combat abuse, and litigation could result in costs to our business.\nMedia stories regarding drug abuse and diversion, including the abuse and diversion of prescription opioid medications and other controlled substances, are commonplace. Aggressive enforcement and unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of opioids, the limitations of abuse-deterrent formulations, the ability of abusers to discover previously unknown ways to abuse our products, public inquiries and investigations into drug abuse or litigation or regulatory or enforcement activity regarding sales, marketing, distribution or storage of opioids could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, on the results of litigation and on our ability to attract or maintain relationships with third-party partners, including suppliers, vendors, advisors, distributors, manufacturers, collaboration partners, administrators and agents.\nManufacturers of prescription opioid medications have been the subject of significant civil and criminal investigatory and enforcement actions even in cases where such medications have received approval from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities. Numerous governmental and private persons and entities are pursuing litigation against opioid manufacturers, including us, as well as distributors and others, asserting alleged violations of various laws and regulations relating to opioids and/or other prescription medicines, relying on common law theories, and seeking to hold the defendants accountable for, among other things, societal costs associated with the misuse and abuse of prescription opioid medications as well as non-prescription opioids. There is a risk we will be subject to similar investigations, enforcement actions or litigations in the future, that we will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts or that we will enter into monetary settlements. Any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In 2019, several manufacturers of prescription opioid medications commenced cases under Title 11 of the U.S. Code in order to address the large volume of claims asserted against them in such litigation. See Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for more information.\nRegulatory actions at the federal, state and local level may seek to limit or restrict the manufacturing, distribution or sale of opioids, both directly and indirectly, and/or to impose novel policy or regulatory mechanisms regarding the manufacturing, distribution or sales of opioids. For example, in April 2019, New York enacted an excise tax on opioids. See the risk factor \u201cOur business and financial condition may be adversely affected by legislation\u201d for more information. Many state legislatures are considering various bills intended to reduce opioid abuse such as by, for example, establishing prescription drug monitoring programs and mandating prescriber education.\nVarious government entities, including the U.S. Congress, state legislatures or other policy-making bodies in the U.S. or elsewhere may hold hearings, conduct investigations and/or issue reports calling attention to opioid misuse and abuse, and may mention or criticize the role of manufacturers, including us, in supplying or marketing opioid medications or failing to take adequate steps to detect or report suspicious orders or to prevent abuse and diversion. Press organizations have reported and likely will continue to report on these issues, and such reporting has and may further result in adverse publicity which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental drug pricing programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting the presentation (or the causing to be presented) of claims for payment (by Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers) that are determined to be false or fraudulent, including presenting a claim for an item or service that was not provided. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which permits private persons to bring suit in the name of the government alleging false or fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. These actions against pharmaceutical companies, which do not require proof of a specific intent to defraud the government, may result in payment of fines to and/or administrative exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid and/or other government healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to laws that require us to enter into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, a 340B Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement and agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs as a condition for having our products eligible for payment under Medicare Part B and Medicaid. We have entered into such agreements. In addition, we are required to report certain pricing information to CMS, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs on a periodic basis to facilitate rebate payments to the State Medicaid Programs, to set Medicare Part B reimbursement levels and to establish the prices that can be charged to certain purchasers, including 340B-covered entities and certain government entities. Any failure to comply with these laws and agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith regard to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, on February 1, 2016, CMS issued a Final Rule implementing the Medicaid Drug Rebate provisions incorporated into the PPACA, effective April 1, 2016 in most instances. Implementation of the Final Rule required operational adjustments by us in order to maintain compliance with applicable law. Ongoing compliance with these program rules, including the requirement that we adopt reasonable assumptions where law, regulation and guidance do not address specific participation issues, may impact the level of rebates that we owe under the program. The Final Rule also expanded the scope of the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to apply to U.S. territories and, pursuant to further rulemaking, that requirement is now effective April 1, 2022, which will require operational adjustments and may result in additional rebate liability. Finally, despite an initial proposal, CMS has not defined the term \u201cline extension\u201d for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. CMS has indicated that manufacturers should rely on the statutory definition of that term and reasonable assumptions in determining which products should be subject to an alternative rebate calculation. In light of the lack of clear guidance on this issue, it is possible that CMS could in the future disagree with a manufacturer\u2019s determination of which products should be subject to higher rebates under the \u201cline extension\u201d rebate calculation.\nWe and other pharmaceutical companies have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits filed by various government entities, alleging generally that we and numerous other pharmaceutical companies reported false pricing information in connection with certain products that are reimbursable by state Medicaid programs, which are partially funded by the federal government. There is a risk we will be subject to similar investigations or litigations in the future, that we will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts or that we will enter into monetary settlements. Any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDecreases in the degree to which individuals are covered by healthcare insurance could result in decreased use of our products.\nEmployers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. Further, in addition to the fact that the TCJA eliminated the PPACA\u2019s requirement that individuals maintain insurance or face a penalty, additional steps by the Trump Administration or other parties to limit or end cost-sharing subsidies to lower-income Americans may increase instability in the insurance marketplace and the number of uninsured Americans. These economic conditions may affect patients\u2019 ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations and lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions could lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including some patients delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. Such changes may result in reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn December 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas held in Texas v. Azar that, because the provisions of the PPACA requiring certain individuals to either obtain health insurance or pay a shared responsibility payment (known as the individual mandate) are no longer permissible under the U.S. Congress\u2019 taxing power, the entire PPACA is no longer constitutional. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion holding that, while the individual mandate was no longer constitutional, the case must be remanded to the district court to further evaluate whether the mandate can be severed from the PPACA or the entire PPACA must be stricken down. In January 2020, petitions for certiorari were filed requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court review the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision and ultimately decide the constitutionality of the PPACA. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to grant the petitions. Changes in law resulting from this ongoing lawsuit or other court challenges to the PPACA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customer concentration may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe primarily sell our branded and generic products to wholesalers, retail drug store chains, supermarket chains, mass merchandisers, distributors, mail order accounts, hospitals and government agencies. Our wholesalers and distributors purchase products from us and, in turn, supply products to retail drug store chains, independent pharmacies and MCOs. Our current customer group reflects significant consolidation in recent years, marked by mergers and acquisitions and other alliances. For example, we understand that McKesson Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. are party to an agreement to jointly source generic pharmaceuticals and Express Scripts, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Innovative Product Alignment, LLC, participates in the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH GPO. Consolidations and joint purchasing arrangements such as these have resulted in increased pricing and other competitive pressures on pharmaceutical companies, including us. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other distributors and the prevalence and influence of MCOs and similar institutions have increased the negotiating power of these groups, enabling them to attempt to extract various demands, including without limitation price discounts, rebates and other restrictive pricing terms. These competitive trends could continue in the future and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTotal revenues from direct customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nRevenues from these customers are included within each of our segments. Accordingly, our revenues, financial condition or results of operations may also be unduly affected by fluctuations in the buying or distribution patterns of these customers. These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler inventory objectives or other factors. In addition, if we were to lose the business of any of these customers, or if any were to fail to pay us on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are currently dependent on outside manufacturers for the manufacture of a significant amount of our products; therefore, we have and will continue to have limited control of the manufacturing process and related costs. Certain of our manufacturers currently constitute the sole source of one or more of our products.\nThird party manufacturers currently manufacture a significant amount of our products pursuant to contractual arrangements. Certain of our manufacturers currently constitute the sole source of our products. For example, Teikoku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. is our sole source of LIDODERM\u00ae and GlaxoSmithKline plc is our sole source of VOLTAREN\u00ae Gel. Because of contractual restraints and the lead-time necessary to obtain FDA approval and/or DEA registration of a new manufacturer, there are no readily accessible alternatives to these manufacturers and replacement of any of these manufacturers may be expensive and time consuming and may cause interruptions in our supply of products to customers. Our business and financial viability are dependent on these third party manufacturers for continued manufacture of our products, the continued regulatory compliance of these manufacturers and the strength, validity and terms of our various contracts with these manufacturers. Any interruption or failure by these manufacturers to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us on schedule or in accordance with our expectations, or any termination by these manufacturers of our supply arrangements, which, in each case, could be the result of one or many factors outside of our control, could delay or prevent our ability to achieve sales expectations, cause interruptions in our supply of products to customers, cause us to incur failure-to-supply penalties, disrupt our operations or cause reputational harm to our company, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on third parties to supply raw materials used in our products and to provide services for certain core aspects of our business. Any interruption or failure by these suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in our products. In addition, we rely on third party suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to provide services for certain core aspects of our business, including manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, customer service support, medical affairs services, clinical studies, sales and other technical and financial services. All third party suppliers and contractors are subject to FDA and very often DEA requirements. Our business and financial viability are dependent on the continued supply of goods and services by these third parties, the regulatory compliance of these third parties and on the strength, validity and terms of our various contracts with these third parties. Any interruption or failure by our suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us on schedule or in accordance with our expectations, or any termination by these third parties of their arrangements with us, which, in each case, could be the result of one or many factors outside of our control, could delay or prevent the development, approval, manufacture or commercialization of our products, result in non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, cause us to incur failure-to-supply penalties, disrupt our operations or cause reputational harm to our company, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may also be unsuccessful in resolving any underlying issues with such suppliers, distributors and partners or replacing them within a reasonable time and on commercially reasonable terms.\nAPIs imported into the European Union (EU) must be certified as complying with the good manufacturing practice standards established by the EU, as stipulated by the International Conference for Harmonization. These regulations place the certification requirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries. Accordingly, the national regulatory authorities of each exporting country must: (i) ensure that all manufacturing plants within their borders that export API into the EU comply with EU manufacturing standards and (ii) for each API exported, present a written document confirming that the exporting plant conforms to EU manufacturing standards. The imposition of this responsibility on the governments of the nations exporting API may cause a shortage of API necessary to manufacture our products, as certain governments may not be willing or able to comply with the regulation in a timely fashion, or at all. A shortage in API may cause us to cease manufacturing of certain products or to incur costs and delays to qualify other suppliers to substitute for those API manufacturers unable to export. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on third parties to provide us with various estimates as a basis for our financial reporting. While we undertake certain procedures to review the reasonableness of this information, we cannot obtain absolute assurance over the accounting methods and controls over the information provided to us by third parties. As a result, we are at risk of them providing us with erroneous data which could impact our reporting. Refer to \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for information about our most significant accounting estimates.\nIf our manufacturing facilities are unable to manufacture our products or the manufacturing process is interrupted due to failure to comply with regulations or for other reasons, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf any of our or our third party manufacturing facilities fail to comply with regulatory requirements or encounter other manufacturing difficulties, it could adversely affect our ability to supply products. All facilities and manufacturing processes used for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products are subject to inspection by regulatory agencies at any time and must be operated in conformity with cGMP and, in the case of controlled substances, DEA regulations. Compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP and DEA requirements applies to both products for which regulatory approval is being sought and to approved products. In complying with cGMP requirements, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities must continually expend significant time, money and effort in production, recordkeeping, quality assurance and quality control so that their products meet applicable specifications and other requirements for product safety, efficacy and quality. Failure to comply with applicable legal requirements subjects our or our third party manufacturing facilities to possible legal or regulatory action, including shutdown, which may adversely affect our ability to supply our products. Additionally, our or our third party manufacturing facilities may face other significant disruptions due to labor strikes, failure to reach acceptable agreement with labor unions, infringement of intellectual property rights, vandalism, natural disaster, outbreak and spread of viral or other diseases, storm or other environmental damage, civil or political unrest, export or import restrictions or other events. Were we not able to manufacture products at our or our third party manufacturing facilities because of regulatory, business or any other reasons, the manufacture and marketing of these products could be interrupted. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor example, the manufacturing facilities qualified to manufacture the enzyme CCH, which is included in our current XIAFLEX\u00ae product and in certain product candidates under development, including for the treatment of cellulite, are subject to such regulatory requirements and oversight. If such facilities fail to comply with cGMP requirements, we may not be permitted to sell our products or may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell them. Further, if an inspection by regulatory authorities indicates that there are deficiencies, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements, we could be required to take remedial actions, stop production or close our facilities, which could disrupt the manufacturing processes and could limit the supply of CCH and/or delay clinical trials and subsequent licensure and/or limit the sale of commercial supplies. In addition, future noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements may result in refusal by regulatory authorities to allow use of CCH in clinical trials, refusal by the government to allow distribution of CCH within the U.S. or other jurisdictions, criminal prosecution, fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, prohibitions or limitations on the commercial sale of products, refusal to allow the entering into of federal and state supply contracts and civil litigation.\nWe purchase certain API and other materials used in our manufacturing operations from foreign and U.S. suppliers. The price and availability of API and other materials is subject to volatility for a number of reasons, many of which may be outside of our control. There is no guarantee that we will always have timely, sufficient or affordable access to critical raw materials or supplies from third parties. An increase in the price, or an interruption in the supply, of any API or raw material could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have limited experience in manufacturing biologic products and may encounter difficulties in our manufacturing processes, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or delay or disrupt manufacture of those products reliant upon our manufacturing operations.\nThe manufacture of biologic products requires significant expertise and capital investment. Although we manufacture CCH, which is included in our current XIAFLEX\u00ae product and in certain product candidates under development, including for the treatment of cellulite, in our Horsham, Pennsylvania facility, we have limited experience in manufacturing CCH or any other biologic products. Biologics such as CCH require processing steps that are highly complex and generally more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. In addition, TESTOPEL\u00ae is manufactured using a unique, proprietary process. If the manufacturing processes are disrupted at the facilities where our biologic products are manufactured, it may be difficult to find alternate manufacturing sites. We may encounter difficulties with the manufacture of CCH and the active ingredient of TESTOPEL\u00ae, which could delay, disrupt or halt our manufacture of such products and/or product candidates, result in product recalls or product liability claims, require write-offs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our products as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials.\nThe DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our products and sets a quota on the production of these products. We, or our contract manufacturing organizations, must annually apply to the DEA for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain these substances and produce our products. In addition, H.R. 6 amends the CSA with respect to quotas by requiring the DEA to estimate the amount and impact of diversion (including overdose deaths and abuse and overall public health impact) of fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone or hydromorphone and to make appropriate quota reductions. As a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or to complete clinical trials. Moreover, the DEA may adjust these quotas from time to time during the year. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our quotas, or modification of our quotas, for controlled substances could delay or result in the stoppage of clinical trials or product launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to retain our key personnel and continue to attract additional professional staff, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors will remain highly dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and commercial personnel. The loss of key scientific, technical and commercial personnel or the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and commercial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we have consulting agreements with certain key individuals and institutions and have employment agreements with our key executives, we may be unsuccessful in retaining personnel or their services under existing agreements. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities and we may be unable to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nThe trading prices of our securities may be volatile, and investments in our securities could decline in value.\nThe market prices for securities of Endo, and of pharmaceutical companies in general, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. For example, in 2019, our ordinary shares traded between $1.97 and $12.49 per share on the NASDAQ. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may cause the market value of our securities to fluctuate:\n\u2022\nFDA approval or disapproval of any of the drug applications we have submitted;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nnew data or new analyses of older data that raise potential safety or effectiveness issues concerning our approved products;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or withdrawals;\n\u2022\ncompetitors announcing technological innovations or new commercial products;\n\u2022\nintroduction of generic or compounded substitutes for our products, including the filing of ANDAs with respect to generic versions of our branded products;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our or others\u2019 proprietary rights, including patents;\n\u2022\ncompetitors\u2019 publicity regarding actual or potential products under development or other activities affecting our competitors or the industry in general;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nnew legislation, regulation, administrative guidance or executive orders, or changes in interpretation of existing legislation, regulation, administrative guidance or executive orders, including by virtue of new judicial decisions, that could affect the development, sale or pricing of pharmaceutical products, the number of individuals with access to affordable healthcare, the taxes we pay and/or other factors;\n\u2022\na determination by a regulatory agency that we are engaging or have engaged in inappropriate sales or marketing activities, including promoting off-label uses of our products;\n\u2022\nsocial and political pressure to lower the cost of pharmaceutical products;\n\u2022\nsocial and political scrutiny over increases in prices of shares of pharmaceutical companies that are perceived to be caused by a strategy of growth through acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlitigation against us or others;\n\u2022\nreports of security analysts and rating agencies;\n\u2022\njudgments or settlements or reports of settlement negotiations concerning opioid-related litigation or claims, and/or other companies commencing cases under Title 11 of the U.S. Code to address opioid-related litigation liabilities; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the political and regulatory environment and international relations as a result of events such as the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (Brexit) and full or partial shutdowns of the U.S. federal government that may occur from time to time, the current U.S. administration and other external factors, including market speculation or disasters and other crises.\nWe have no plans to pay regular dividends on our ordinary shares or to conduct ordinary share repurchases.\nWe currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our ordinary shares. Additionally, while the Board has approved a share buyback program (the 2015 Share Buyback Program), of which there is approximately $2.3 billion available as of December 31, 2019, we currently do not intend to conduct ordinary share repurchases in the foreseeable future. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of ordinary shares as well as any repurchase of our ordinary shares under the 2015 Share Buyback Program will be at the sole discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of both cash and property dividends or share repurchases and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. In addition, our existing debt instruments restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our ordinary shares and conducting ordinary share repurchases. Agreements governing any future indebtedness, in addition to those governing our current indebtedness, may not permit us to pay dividends on our ordinary shares or conduct ordinary share repurchases.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected by shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expenses, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our share price.\nIn recent years, shareholder activism involving corporate governance, strategic direction and operations has become increasingly prevalent. If we become the subject of such shareholder activism, their demands may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management, employees and Board. Also, we may incur substantial costs, including legal fees and other expenses, related to such activist shareholder matters. Perceived uncertainties resulting from such activist shareholder matters may result in loss of potential business opportunities with our current and potential customers and business partners, be exploited by our competitors and make attracting and retaining qualified personnel more difficult. In addition, such shareholder activism may cause significant fluctuations in our share price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions, uncertainties or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur operations could be disrupted if our information systems fail, if we are unsuccessful in implementing necessary upgrades or if we are subject to cyber-attacks.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and networks, hardware and software systems and our other information technology. As such, we continuously invest financial and other resources to maintain, enhance, further develop, replace or add to our information technology infrastructure. Such efforts carry risks such as cost overruns, project delays and business interruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, these measures are not guaranteed to protect against all cybersecurity incidents.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and maintain information, which includes confidential, proprietary and personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to risk of cyber-attacks, which are increasing in frequency and sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups, \u201chackers\u201d and others. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, viruses, worms, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Despite our efforts to monitor and safeguard our systems to prevent data compromise, the possibility of a future data compromise cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with intrusion, tampering and theft remain. In addition, we do not have insurance coverage with respect to system failures or cyber-attacks. If our systems were to fail or we are unable to successfully expand the capacity of these systems, or we are unable to integrate new technologies into our existing systems, our operations and financial results could suffer.\nWe also have outsourced certain elements and functions of our operations, including elements of our information technology infrastructure, to third parties, some of which are outside the U.S. As a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our and our vendors\u2019 systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions. The size and complexity of our and our vendors\u2019 systems and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, our partners, our vendors or other third parties, or from attacks by malicious third parties.\nThe Company and its vendors\u2019 information technology operations are spread across multiple, sometimes inconsistent platforms, which pose difficulties in maintaining data integrity across systems. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional or improper dissemination or destruction of confidential information stored in the Company\u2019s systems.\nAny breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology or information and/or adversely affect our business position. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to our company and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNon-U.S. regulatory requirements vary, including with respect to the regulatory approval process, and failure to obtain regulatory approval or maintain compliance with requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions would prevent or impact the marketing of our products in those jurisdictions.\nWe have worldwide intellectual property rights to market many of our products and product candidates and intend to seek approval to market certain of our existing or potential future products outside of the U.S. Approval of a product by the regulatory authorities of a particular country is generally required prior to manufacturing or marketing that product in that country. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Non-U.S. regulatory approval processes generally include risks similar to those associated with obtaining FDA approval, as further described herein. Approval by the FDA does not guarantee approval by the regulatory authorities of any other country, nor does the approval by foreign regulatory authorities in one country guarantee approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA.\nOutside of the U.S., regulatory agencies generally evaluate and monitor the safety, efficacy and quality of pharmaceutical products and devices and impose regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing processes, stability testing, recordkeeping and quality standards, among others. These requirements vary by jurisdiction. In certain countries, including emerging and developing markets, the applicable healthcare and drug regulatory regimes are continuing to evolve and new requirements may be implemented. Ensuring and maintaining compliance with these varying and evolving requirements is and will continue to be difficult, time-consuming and costly. In seeking regulatory approvals in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must also continue to comply with U.S. laws and regulations, including those imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). See the risk factor \u201cThe risks related to our global operations may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d If we fail to comply with these various regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to generate non-U.S. revenue will be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by the risks associated with having operated a medical device manufacturing business.\nWe are subject to various risks associated with having operated a medical device manufacturing business, which risks could have adverse effects, including potential and actual product liability claims for any defective or allegedly defective goods that were distributed and increased government scrutiny and/or potential claims regarding the marketing of medical devices.\nWe are subject to health information privacy and data protection laws that include penalties for noncompliance. Our failure to comply with various laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve. Certain countries in which we operate have, or are developing, laws protecting the confidentiality of individually identifiable personal information, including patient health information. This includes federal and state laws and regulations in the U.S. as well as in Europe and other markets.\nFor example, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the state of California and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Because the CCPA only recently went into effect, many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts and best practices are still being developed, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts.\nIn addition, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which replaced the pre-existing EU Data Protection Directive and became enforceable as of May 25, 2018, imposes strict restrictions on our authority to collect, analyze and transfer personal data regarding persons in the EU, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR, which has extra-territorial scope and substantial fines for breaches (up to 4% of global annual revenue or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater) grants individuals whose personal data (which is very broadly defined) is collected or otherwise processed the right to access the data, request its deletion and control its use and disclosure. The GDPR also requires notification of a breach in the security of such data to be provided within 72 hours of discovering the breach. Although the GDPR itself is self-executing across all EU member states, data protection authorities from different EU member states may interpret and apply the regulation somewhat differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. To date, there has been very little interpretation of the regulation by the EU member states\u2019 different data protection authorities and little time for enforcement, which makes predicting future enforcement very difficult. That uncertainty contributes to liability exposure risk.\nAs did the pre-existing Data Protection Directive, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, and transfers of personal data to such countries may be made only in certain circumstances, such as where the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest or the individual to whom the personal data relates has given his or her explicit consent to the transfer after being informed of the risks involved.\nWe have policies and practices that we believe make us compliant with applicable privacy regulations, including the GDPR. Nevertheless, there remains a risk of failure to comply with the rules arising from the GDPR or privacy laws in other countries in which we operate. Should a transgression be deemed to have occurred, it could lead to government enforcement actions and significant sanctions or penalties against us, adversely impact our results of operations and subject us to negative publicity. Such liabilities could materially affect our operations.\nThere has also been increased enforcement activity in the U.S. particularly related to data security breaches. A violation of these laws or regulations by us or our third party vendors could subject us to penalties, fines, liability and/or possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid. Such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face risks relating to the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a remain-or-leave referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s membership within the EU, the result of which favored the Brexit. On March 29, 2017, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom delivered a formal notice of withdrawal to the EU. On May 22, 2017, the Council of the EU (the Council), adopted a decision authorizing the opening of Brexit negotiations with the United Kingdom and formally nominated the European Commission as the EU negotiator. The Council also adopted negotiating directives for the talks. On January 9, 2020, a Withdrawal Agreement Bill was passed by the United Kingdom House of Commons and, subject to scrutiny by the United Kingdom House of Lords, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill approves an eleven-month transition period starting on January 31, 2020 in which the United Kingdom will cease to be a member of the EU, but will continue to follow the EU\u2019s rules and contribute to its budget. In the event a full trade deal is not reached between the United Kingdom and EU by the December 31, 2020 deadline and there is no further extension, trade relations between the United Kingdom and the EU will be governed by any terms agreed within this period or by the World Trade Organization Rules. The impact on our business as a result of Brexit will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations and on the ultimate manner and timing of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. As a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in financial markets, exchange rates and interest rates. These uncertainties could increase the volatility of, or reduce, our investment results in particular periods or over time. Brexit could adversely affect political, regulatory, economic or market conditions in the United Kingdom and in Europe and it could contribute to instability in global political institutions and regulatory agencies.\nSimilarly, if the United Kingdom were to significantly alter its regulations affecting the pharmaceutical industry, we could face significant new costs. It may also be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our internal operations in order to comply with new regulations. In addition, since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, the referendum could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the EU. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any regulatory approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or EU for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business. Similarly, it is unclear at this time what Brexit\u2019s impact will have on our intellectual property rights and the process for obtaining and defending such rights. It is possible that certain intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, granted by the EU will cease being enforceable in the United Kingdom absent special arrangements to the contrary. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe risks related to our global operations may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2019, approximately 4% of our total revenues were from customers outside the U.S. Some of these sales were to governmental entities and other organizations with extended payment terms. Conducting business internationally, including the sourcing, manufacturing, development, sale and distribution of our products and services across international borders, subjects us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations, such as various anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, export control laws, customs and import laws, and anti-boycott laws. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from criminal acts committed by our employees or third parties with whom we work. If we are found liable for violations of the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, we could suffer significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including, but not limited to, imprisonment of individuals, fines, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting, as well as reputational harm. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities.\nIn addition, some countries where we source, develop, manufacture or sell products are subject to political, economic and/or social instability. Our non-U.S. R&D, manufacturing and sales operations expose us and our employees, representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For example, we perform certain of our R&D functions in India. We also manufacture certain of our products in India and expect that our Indian manufacturing operations could expand in the future. A disruption in our Indian operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risks include:\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and non-U.S. governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity;\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability or disruptions, including local and regional instability, or disruptions due to natural disasters, such as severe weather and geological events, disruptions due to civil unrest and hostilities, rioting, military activity, terror attacks or armed hostilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new trade restrictions including foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022\nsupply disruptions and increases in energy and transportation costs;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u2022\nchanges in global tax laws and/or the imposition by tax authorities of significant fines, penalties and additional taxes;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncompetition from local, regional and international competitors;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, including cultural differences and additional employment regulations, union workforce negotiations and potential disputes in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in foreign countries.\nWe also face the risk that some of our competitors have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations generally and may be able to manage unexpected crises more easily. Furthermore, whether due to language, cultural or other differences, public and other statements that we make may be misinterpreted, misconstrued or taken out of context in different jurisdictions. Moreover, the internal political stability of, or the relationship between, any country or countries where we conduct business operations may deteriorate, including relationships between the U.S. and other countries. Changes in other countries\u2019 economic conditions, product pricing, political stability or the state of relations between any such countries are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations, payment and credit terms and our ability to collect foreign receivables. Any such changes could lead to a decline in our profitability and/or adversely impact our ability to do business. Any meaningful deterioration of the political or social stability in and/or diplomatic relations between any countries in which we or our partners and suppliers do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A substantial slowdown of the global economy, or major national economies, could negatively affect growth in the markets in which we operate. Such a slowdown could result in national governments making significant cuts to their public spending, including national healthcare budgets, or reducing the level of reimbursement they are willing and able to provide to us for our products and, as a result, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations. We have little influence over these factors and changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot provide assurance that one or more of these factors will not harm our business. Any material decrease in our non-U.S. R&D, manufacturing or sales could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, which may require us to refinance all or part of our then-outstanding indebtedness. Any refinancing of this substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates. Additionally, we have a significant amount of floating rate indebtedness and an increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness. Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. This could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we have total debt of approximately $8.47 billion in aggregate principal amount. Our substantial indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of rising interest rates with respect to the borrowings under our variable rate indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash on hand and/or from future operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to pay amounts due under our outstanding indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs, such as future capital expenditures or contingent liabilities as a result of adverse business developments, including expenses related to our ongoing and future legal proceedings and governmental investigations as well as increased pricing pressures or otherwise, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then-existing indebtedness, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any refinancing of this substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, which will depend on the conditions of the markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. At any time and from time to time, we may also be pursuing activities to extend our debt maturities, lower principal balances, reduce interest expense or obtain covenant flexibility. Activities could include, without limitation, one or more tender offers, exchange offers, debt-for-equity exchanges or consent solicitations. We cannot predict if or when we would conduct any such activity, whether any such activities will achieve their intended results or whether any such activity could impact our financial results or be dilutive.\nWhile interest rates have been at record low levels in recent years, this low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely. At December 31, 2019, approximately $3.3 billion and $0.3 billion of principal amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined in Note 14. Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report), respectively, bear interest at variable rates. Any future borrowings by the Company could also have variable interest rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase our cost of servicing our indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may materially adversely affect our interest expense related to our outstanding debt.\nA significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness, including, at December 31, 2019, $3.3 billion outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and $0.3 billion outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, bears interest rates in relation to LIBOR. Any future amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility or Revolving Credit Facility would also bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our interest election. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has proposed replacing LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)). At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Such developments and any other legal or regulatory changes in the method by which LIBOR is determined or the transition from LIBOR to a successor benchmark may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR and changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR, which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in LIBOR\u2019s determination and, in certain situations, could result in LIBOR no longer being determined and published. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 14. Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report) and we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial market may be disrupted and there could be significant increases in benchmark rates or borrowing costs to borrowers as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market, significant increases in benchmark rates or borrowing costs or our inability to refinance the Credit Agreement with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways, a default of which may result in acceleration of certain of our indebtedness.\nWe are subject to various covenants in the instruments governing our debt that limit our and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness. If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately, terminate all commitments to extend further credit, foreclose against all the assets comprising the collateral securing or otherwise supporting the debt and pursue other legal remedies. The instruments governing our debt may contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions that may cause all of the debt issued under such instruments to become immediately due and payable as a result of a default under an unrelated debt instrument. Our assets and cash flows may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if the obligations thereunder were accelerated upon an event of default. We may need to conduct asset sales or pursue other alternatives, including proceedings under applicable insolvency laws relating to some or all of our business. The covenants are also subject to a number of exceptions, including the ability to incur certain additional amounts of secured and unsecured indebtedness, which could exacerbate any of these risks. Any or all of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For a description of our indebtedness, see Note 14. Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the TCJA, was signed into law, significantly altering the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the Code) effective, in substantial part, January 1, 2018. The TCJA, among other things, includes:\n\u2022\nchanges to U.S. federal tax rates;\n\u2022\nexpanded limitations on the deductibility of interest;\n\u2022\nimmediate expensing of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a \u201cterritorial\u201d system;\n\u2022\nthe creation of an anti-base erosion minimum tax system; and\n\u2022\nthe modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nAdditionally, the TCJA eliminates the ability to carry back any future net operating losses and only allows for carryforwards, the utilization of which is limited to 80% of taxable income in a given carryforward year. This could affect the timing of our ability to utilize net operating losses in the future.\nThe aforementioned changes could, individually or in aggregate, increase our future effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, prospective or retroactive regulatory and administrative guidance relating to the TCJA could adversely impact our businesses and our current and future projections of U.S. cash taxes.\nFurther future changes to tax laws could materially adversely affect us.\nUnder current law, we expect Endo International plc to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, changes to the rules in Section 7874 of the Code or regulations promulgated thereunder or other guidance issued by the Treasury or the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to us, Endo Health Solutions Inc. (EHSI) and/or their respective shareholders and affiliates. Consequently, there can be no assurance that there will not exist in the future a change in law that might cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including with retroactive effect.\nIn addition, Ireland\u2019s Department of Finance, Luxembourg\u2019s Ministry of Finance, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Commission and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations and there are several current proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the taxation of multinational corporations. As a result, the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and increase our effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The potential impact of changes in tax laws in such jurisdictions could have a material impact on the Company.\nThe IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAlthough Endo International plc is incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that it should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. A corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 provides an exception pursuant to which a non-U.S. incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nUnder Section 7874, we would be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the former shareholders of EHSI owned, immediately after the Paladin transactions (within the meaning of Section 7874), less than 80% (by both vote and value) of Endo shares by reason of holding shares in EHSI (the ownership test). The former EHSI shareholders owned less than 80% (by both vote and value) of the shares in Endo after the Paladin merger by reason of their ownership of shares in EHSI. As a result, under current law, we expect Endo International plc to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874, including with respect to the provisions regarding the application of the ownership test. Our obligation to complete the Paladin transactions was conditional upon its receipt of a Section 7874 opinion from our counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (Skadden), dated as of the closing date of the Paladin transactions and subject to certain qualifications and limitations set forth therein, to the effect that Section 7874 and the regulations promulgated thereunder should not apply in such a manner so as to cause Endo to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes from and after the closing date. However, an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or a court. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a position contrary to Skadden\u2019s Section 7874 opinion or that a court will not agree with the IRS in the event of litigation.\nThe effective rate of taxation upon our results of operations is dependent on multi-national tax considerations.\nWe earn a portion of our income outside the U.S. That portion of our earnings is generally taxed at the rates applicable to the activities undertaken by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits and the repatriation of earnings from our subsidiaries for which we have not provided for taxes. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. We periodically assess our tax positions to determine the adequacy of our tax provisions, which are subject to significant discretion. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made.\nWe may not be able to successfully maintain our low tax rates or other tax positions, which could adversely affect our businesses and financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and also maintain subsidiaries in, among other jurisdictions, the U.S., Canada, India, the United Kingdom and Luxembourg. The IRS and other taxing authorities may continue to challenge our tax positions. The IRS presently is examining certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 U.S. income tax returns for fiscal years ended between December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2015 and, in connection with those examinations, is reviewing our tax positions related to, among other things, certain intercompany arrangements, including the level of profit earned by our U.S. subsidiaries pursuant to such arrangements, and a worthless stock deduction directly attributable to product liability losses. The IRS may examine our tax returns for other fiscal years and/or for other tax positions. Similarly, other tax authorities, including the Canada Revenue Agency, are currently examining our non-U.S. tax returns. Additionally, other jurisdictions where we are not currently under audit remain subject to potential future examinations. Such examinations may lead to proposed or actual adjustments to our taxes that may be material, individually or in the aggregate.\nResponding to or defending any challenge or proposed adjustment to our tax positions is expensive, consumes time and other resources and diverts management\u2019s attention. We cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit challenging any of our tax positions, the cost involved in responding to and defending any such audit and resulting litigation, or the outcome. If we are unsuccessful in any of these matters, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future or repay certain tax refunds, any of which could require us to reduce our operating costs, decrease efforts in support of our products or seek to raise additional funds, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use U.S. tax attributes to offset U.S. taxable income may be limited.\nExisting and future tax laws and regulations may limit our ability to use U.S. tax attributes including, but not limited to, net operating losses and excess interest expense, to offset U.S. taxable income. For a period of time following the 2014 Paladin transactions, Section 7874 of the Code precludes our U.S. affiliates from utilizing U.S. tax attributes to offset taxable income if we complete certain transactions with related non-U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department has issued temporary and proposed regulations related to corporate inversions and earnings stripping. The limitations on the use of certain tax attributes and deductions in these regulations are in addition to existing rules that could impose more restrictive limitations in the event that cumulative changes in our stock ownership within a three-year period exceeded certain thresholds. Such changes or the adoption of additional limitations could impact our overall utilization of deferred tax assets, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative, regulatory and other efforts, our sales of generic products may suffer.\nMany pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition. These efforts have included:\n\u2022\npursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of earlier patents, which could extend patent protection for additional years;\n\u2022\nusing the Citizen Petition process (for example, under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.30) to request amendments to FDA standards;\n\u2022\nattempting to use the legislative and regulatory process to have products reclassified or rescheduled or to set definitions of abuse-deterrent formulations to protect patents and profits; and\n\u2022\nengaging in state-by-state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic products.\nIf pharmaceutical companies or other third parties are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means, our sales of generic products and our growth prospects may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot determine what effect Section 610 of the FCAA 2020 may have on limiting or preventing the success of pharmaceutical companies or other third parties in delaying generic competition.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders.\nOur shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. As an Irish company, we are governed by Irish Companies Act 2014 (the Companies Act). The Companies Act and other relevant aspects of Irish law differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, the provisions relating to interested director and officer transactions, acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. For example, under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. As a result, shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against the directors or officers of a company and may pursue a right of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. In addition, depending on the circumstances, the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares may subject individuals to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax.\nAny attempts to take us over will be subject to Irish Takeover Rules and subject to review by the Irish Takeover Panel.\nWe are subject to Irish Takeover Rules, under which the Board will not be permitted to take any action which might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once it has received an approach which may lead to an offer or has reason to believe an offer is imminent.\nWe are an Irish company and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or certain of our officers and directors.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and a substantial portion of our assets are located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. In addition, some of our officers and directors reside outside the U.S., and some or all of their respective assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. It may be difficult for investors to effect service of process against us or such officers or directors or to enforce against us or them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.\nThere is no treaty between Ireland and the U.S. providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. The following requirements must be met before a foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in Ireland:\n\u2022\nthe judgment must be for a definite sum;\n\u2022\nthe judgment must be final and conclusive; and\n\u2022\nthe judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nAn Irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if the judgment violated Irish public policy, if the judgment is in breach of natural justice or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment. Further, an Irish court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Judgments of U.S. courts of liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish courts if deemed to be contrary to public policy in Ireland.", "PERMNO": 88436, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ENDP"}
