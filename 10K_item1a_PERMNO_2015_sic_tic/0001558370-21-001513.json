{"cik": "927003", "company": "ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any of which could cause our results to be adversely impacted and could result in a decline in the value or loss of an investment in our common stock. Other factors may also exist that we cannot anticipate or that we currently do not consider to be material based on information that is currently available. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future results. Such risks and uncertainties may also impact the accuracy of forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nCOVID-19, natural disasters, and related risks\nCOVID-19 could further materially adversely affect our business, workforce, supply chain, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe continuing spread in 2020 of COVID-19 and related foreign and domestic government actions restricting travel, commerce and gathering has adversely affected our manufacturing locations. COVID-19 has also resulted in economic recessions and high unemployment in many countries which could negatively impact future customer purchases of our products. If COVID-19 continues to spread and restrictions remain in place or are reinstituted, we may continue to see adverse impact on our ability (a) to manufacture, test, service and ship our products, (b) to get required materials and sub-assemblies to build and service our products and (c) to staff labor and management for manufacturing, research and development, supply chain, service, and administrative operations. Further, we may experience adverse impact with our global supply chain partners and transportation service providers which may result in increased costs and material shortages. In addition, much of our workforce is now working remotely. While we have been successful in transitioning to this remote environment, the long-term impact on productivity and innovation is not yet clear. As a result, COVID-19 could adversely impact our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings and cash flow and could require further expenditures. This situation continues to evolve, and other impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. We have an active rapid response team to mitigate risks we are aware of currently and as they arise.\nOur results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.\nWe have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster, fire, explosion, or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIndustry-related risks\nThe industries in which we compete are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles.\nAs a supplier to the global semiconductor equipment, telecom, networking, data center computing, industrial, and medical industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length, and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. Certain of these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers\u2019 manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers\u2019 products, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers\u2019 purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses, and net income. We may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to the declines in demand by reducing our costs. We may be required to record significant reserves for excess and obsolete inventory as demand for our products changes.\nTo meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand, we must have enough manufacturing capacity and inventory to fulfill customer orders, effectively manage our supply chain, and attract, retain, and motivate enough qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, following record levels of demand in the first half of 2018, the Semiconductor Equipment market experienced a decline, and, as a result, Advanced Energy\u2019s revenue from the Semiconductor Equipment market declined 24.5% during 2019, as compared to 2018. Although the Semiconductor Equipment market improved during the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020, it is unclear how long this recovery will last. In addition, the market may be characterized in the future with more \"mini-ramps\" rather than sustained growth periods as experienced during 2015-2017 given market dynamics, inventory levels, and geopolitical changes. In addition, our Data Center Computing and Telecom\nand Networking markets are characterized by large program investments, which can cause variations in quarterly or annual revenues. For example, during 2020 our growth in data center computing and telecom networking has been driven by share gains at specific customer accounts. Towards the end of 2020, we began to experience a period of digestion by our major customers resulting in lower demand. We expect this digestion to continue into the first half of 2021 and overall business levels may not continue to be realized at these levels each quarter.\nWe must achieve design wins to retain our existing customers and to obtain new customers, although design wins achieved do not necessarily result in substantial sales.\nDriven by continuing technology migration and changing customers demand, the markets we serve are constantly changing in terms of advancement in applications, core technology and competitive pressures. New products we design for capital equipment manufacturers typically have a lifespan of five to ten years. Increasingly, we are required to accelerate our investment in research and development to meet time-to-market, performance and technology adoption cycle needs of our customers simply to compete for design wins. Given such up-front investments we make to develop, evaluate, and qualify products in the design win process, our success and future growth depend on our products being designed into our customers new generations of equipment as they develop new technologies and applications. We must work with these manufacturers early in their design cycles to modify, enhance and upgrade our products or design new products that meet the requirements of their new systems. The design win process is highly competitive, and we may win or lose new design wins for our existing customers or new customers next generations of equipment. If existing or new customers do not choose us during the design win process, our market share will be reduced, the potential revenues related to the lifespan of our customers\u2019 products, which can be five to ten years, will not be realized, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely impacted.\nBusiness model, acquisitions, and capital structure related risks\nDespite the continued evolution of our manufacturing footprint our product lines are manufactured at only a few sites and our sites are not generally interchangeable.\nOur power products for the semiconductor industry are manufactured in Shenzhen, PRC and Penang, Malaysia. Our high voltage products are manufactured in Ronkonkoma and Lockport, New York, Littlehampton, United Kingdom and Shenzhen, PRC. Our thermal instrumentation products are manufactured in Vancouver, Washington, Littlehampton, United Kingdom and Frankfurt, Germany. Our pyrometry solutions are manufactured in Ballerup, Denmark, Frankfurt, Germany, Magdeburg, Germany and Vancouver, Washington. Our telecom, networking, data center computing, and medical products are manufactured in Zhongshan, PRC, Rosario, Philippines and Santa Rosa, Philippines. Most facilities are under operating lease and interruptions in operations could be caused by early termination of existing leases by landlords or failure by landlords to renew existing leases upon expiration, including the possibility that suitable operating locations may not be available in proximity to existing facilities which could result in labor or supply chain risks. Each facility manufactures different products, and therefore, is not interchangeable. Natural, uncontrollable occurrences or other operational issues at any of our manufacturing facilities could significantly reduce or disrupt our productivity at such site and could prevent us from meeting our customers\u2019 requirements in a timely manner, or at all.\nAdditionally, we have a plan to relocate our Shenzhen, PRC manufacturing facility by December 2021. As a result, we are investing in a dual manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia capable of manufacturing our semiconductor and other products. We believe this investment will help to mitigate our exposure to regional risks, improve our business continuity profile and lower costs over time. We opened this facility in 2020; however, it may take additional time to realize the facility\u2019s full production capacity given the impact of COVID-19.\nOur long-term success and results of operations depend on our ability to successfully integrate Artesyn\u2019s business and operations and realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition.\nIn September 2019, we acquired Artesyn, and we are continuing to combine Artesyn\u2019s business with our business. The acquisition of Artesyn has significantly increased our embedded power product offerings, increased our exposure to the Industrial and Medical, Data Center Computing, and Telecom and Networking markets, and significantly increased the number of employees and facilities.\nTo realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, we must continue to combine our businesses in an efficient and effective manner and realize our synergy and cost-savings targets. Integrating Artesyn\u2019s business and operations with ours requires significant management attention, effort, and expenditures, and we may not be able to achieve the longer-term integration goals in an effective, complete, timely or cost-efficient manner.\nPotential risks related to the successful integration of Artesyn\u2019s business include our ability to:\n\u25cf maintain and improve Artesyn\u2019s financial and operating results while integrating and optimizing our combined sales, marketing, manufacturing, and corporate administrative organizations;\n\u25cf optimize our combined worldwide manufacturing footprint while utilizing Artesyn\u2019s vertically integrated manufacturing model for a broader set of company products;\n\u25cf successfully eliminate fixed costs previously absorbed by other businesses prior to the transaction;\n\u25cf recognize and capitalize on anticipated product sales and technology enhancement opportunities presented by our combined businesses;\n\u25cf integrate our information technology systems to mitigate cyber-security risks and enable the management and operation of the combined business.\nIf we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of Artesyn\u2019s business into our business over the long-term, we may be unable to realize the long-term revenue growth, synergies, cost-savings, and other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition and our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have and may continue to incur transaction-related costs, including legal, regulatory, and other costs associated with implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Artesyn\u2019s business and operations may not achieve the anticipated revenues and operating results. Any of the foregoing risks could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur debt obligations and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to operate our business or pursue our business strategies, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could significantly reduce stockholder benefits from a change of control event.\nOur debt obligations could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nOur debt obligations impose financial covenants on us and our subsidiaries that require us to maintain a certain leverage ratio. The financial covenants place certain restrictions on our business that may affect our ability to execute our business strategy successfully or take other actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our Company. These include limitations or restrictions, among other things, on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u25cf make domestic and foreign investments and extend credit;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf transfer and sell assets;\n\u25cf effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u25cf create liens on our assets to secure debt.\nOur debt obligations contain certain customary events of default. Any breach of the covenants or other event of default could cause a default on our debt obligations, which could restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. If there were an event of default under certain provisions of our debt arrangements that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt may be able to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt instrument, plus any required settlement costs, to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay\nborrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. If we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our indebtedness as required, or amend the covenants contained in these agreements, the lenders can exercise all rights and remedies available under our Credit Agreement or applicable laws or equity.\nOur orders of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies are based on demand forecasts.\nWe place orders with many of our suppliers based on our customers\u2019 quarterly forecasts and our annual forecasts. These forecasts are based on our customers\u2019 and our expectations as to demand for our products. As the quarter and the year progress, such demand can change rapidly or we may realize that our customers\u2019 expectations were overly optimistic or pessimistic, especially when industry or general economic conditions change. Orders with our suppliers cannot always be amended in response. In addition, to assure availability of certain components or to obtain priority pricing, we have entered into contracts with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase a specified number of components and subassemblies each quarter, even if we are not able to use such components or subassemblies. Moreover, we have obligations to some of our customers to hold a minimum amount of finished goods in inventory, to fulfill just in time orders, regardless of whether the customers expect to place such orders. We currently have firm purchase commitments and agreements with various suppliers to ensure the availability of components. If demand for our products does not continue at current levels, we might not be able to use all the components that we are required to purchase under these commitments and agreements, and our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory may increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If demand for our products exceeds our customers\u2019 and our forecasts, we may not be able to timely obtain enough raw materials, parts, components, or subassemblies, on favorable terms or at all, to fulfill the excess demand. For example, entering 2021 there is global shortage of certain electronics and semiconductor parts given higher global demand and the impact of COVID-19 on the global supply chain. If we are not able to obtain parts in a reasonable timeframe our business may be adversely impacted.\nActivities necessary to integrate acquisitions may result in costs more than current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.\nWe have completed acquisitions in the past and we may acquire other businesses in the future. The success of such transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls process to these acquired businesses. The integration of acquisitions may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first entered the acquisition transaction. If actual integration costs are higher than amounts originally anticipated, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe transitioned a significant amount of our supply base to Asian suppliers.\nWe transitioned the purchasing of a substantial portion of components for our products to Asian suppliers to lower our materials costs and shipping expenses. These components might require us to incur higher than anticipated testing or repair costs, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Customers who have strict and extensive qualification requirements might not accept our products if these lower-cost components do not meet their requirements. A delay or refusal by our customers to accept such products, as well as an inability of our suppliers to meet our purchasing requirements, might require us to purchase higher-priced components from our existing suppliers or might cause us to lose sales to these customers, either of which could lead to decreased revenue and gross margins and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe generally have no long-term contracts with our customers requiring them to purchase any specified quantities from us.\nOur sales are primarily made on a purchase order basis, and we generally have no long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which is typical in the industries we serve. As a result, we are limited in our ability to predict the level of future sales or commitments from our current customers, which may diminish our ability to allocate\nlabor, materials, and equipment in the manufacturing process effectively. In addition, we may purchase inventory in anticipation of sales that do not materialize, resulting in excess and obsolete inventory write-offs.\nIf we are unable to adjust our business strategy successfully for some of our product lines to reflect the increasing price sensitivity on the part of our customers, our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur business strategy for many of our product lines has been focused on product performance and technology innovation to provide enhanced efficiencies and productivity. Our customers continually exert pressure on us to reduce our prices and extend payment terms and we may be required to enter into long term reduced pricing agreements with our largest customers to remain competitive. In addition, we compete in markets in which customers may include dual or multi-sourcing of power. We believe some of our Asian competitors benefit from local governmental funding incentives and purchasing preferences from end-user customers in their respective countries. If competition against any of our product lines should come to focus solely on price rather than on product performance and technology innovation, we will need to adjust our business strategy, product offerings and product costs accordingly, and if we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our sales and accounts receivable are concentrated among a few customers.\nThe following table summarizes the percentage of total sales derived from our ten largest customers:\nThe following table summarizes sales to and percentage of total sales from Applied Materials, Inc. and Lam Research Corp., our two largest customers (in thousands):\nWe have an accounts receivable balance from Applied Materials, Inc. of $33.4 million and $36.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A significant decline in sales from this or other large customers, or the Company\u2019s inability to collect on these sales, could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management, technical, marketing, and sales employees. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees or attracting or retaining additional skilled personnel as required. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position. Our success in hiring and retaining employees depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, our reputation, culture and working environment, competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We must develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity during the inevitable unpredictability of personnel retention. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior employees, if our succession plans do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate for reasons over which we have no control.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, extreme price and volume fluctuations. Prices of securities of technology companies have been especially volatile and have often fluctuated for reasons that are unrelated to their operating performance. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur operating results are subject to fluctuations, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our share price may decrease significantly.\nOur annual and quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, our sales cycle for development work is relatively long, and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed for the short term, a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period. If our earnings do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our stock could decline.\nCommercial and financial related risks\nWe are highly dependent on our intellectual property.\nOur success depends significantly on our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents and non-disclosure agreements; however, we might not be able to protect our technology, and customers or competitors might be able to develop similar technology independently. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries might not afford our intellectual property the same protections as do the laws of the United States. Our intellectual property is not protected by patents in several countries in which we do business, and we have limited patent protection in other countries, including the PRC Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the European Union and certain industrialized countries in Asia, including Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe PRC commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the commercial law in the United States. Limited protection of intellectual property is available under PRC law. Consequently, manufacturing our products in the PRC may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property.\nOur operations in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Asia Pacific region are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties over which we have little or no control and we may be unable to alter our business practice in time to avoid reductions in revenues.\nA significant portion of our operations outside the United States are located in the PRC, which exposes us to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, changes in local economic conditions, changes in customs regulations and tariffs, changes in tax policies, changes in PRC laws and regulations, possible expropriation or other PRC government actions, and unsettled political conditions including potential changes in U.S. policy regarding overseas manufacturing. At various times during recent years, the U.S. and PRC have had significant disagreements over geopolitical, trade and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any escalating political controversies between the U.S. and PRC, whether or not directly related to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, results of operations, and financial condition. See \"We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide financial markets and the global economy\" risk factor below.\nAdditionally, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among PRC, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States, that political, diplomatic, and national security influences might lead to trade, technology, or capital disputes,\nand/or disruptions, in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry. This would adversely affect our business with PRC, Hong Kong, and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia Pacific region or global economy.\nActions by the Chinese government extending its territorial claims, such as the recent passage of the national security law in Hong Kong and the planned establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone over the South China Sea, raises the fear of conflict that could result in international reprisal. Actions by the U.S. government on trade policy against the PRC and companies like Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. have also escalated tensions. Lastly, the recent U.S. and PRC consulate closures and the continuing Hong Kong political unrest is creating more uncertainty. Should the PRC take any actions against Taiwan, we could see additional risks to diplomatic and trade relations in the region. Given our expanded presence in the PRC and Hong Kong, the company\u2019s business results, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by these developments and other changes to political, diplomatic, and social conditions. Moreover, PRC\u2019s policies towards, and treatment of, U.S. companies operating in PRC and Hong Kong could change quickly resulting in an adverse impact on the Company.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in international operations.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we have both domestic and international concentrations of cash and investments. The value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.\nSales to our customers outside the United States were approximately 68.7% and 59.2% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our acquisitions have increased our presence in international locations. Our success producing goods internationally and competing in international markets is subject to our ability to manage various risks and difficulties, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf our ability to effectively manage our employees at remote locations who are operating in different business environments from the United States;\n\u25cf our ability to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers and other local businesses;\n\u25cf compliance with product safety requirements and standards that are different from those of the United States;\n\u25cf variations and changes in laws applicable to our operations in different jurisdictions, including enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u25cf trade restrictions, political instability, disruptions in financial markets, and deterioration of economic conditions;\n\u25cf customs regulations and the import and export of goods (including customs audits in various countries that occur from time to time);\n\u25cf the ability to provide enough levels of technical support in different locations;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain business licenses that may be needed in international locations to support expanded operations;\n\u25cf timely collecting accounts receivable from foreign customers including significant balances in accounts receivable from foreign customers as of December 31, 2020;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs, taxes, and foreign currency exchange rates; and\nOur profitability and ability to implement our business strategies, maintain market share and compete successfully in international markets will be compromised if we are unable to manage these and other international risks successfully.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with worldwide financial markets and the global economy.\nOur business depends on the expansion of manufacturing capacity in our end markets and the installation base for the products we sell. In the past, severe tightening of credit markets, turmoil in the financial markets, and a weakening global economy have contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate and has negatively impacted the global demand for our products. Some of our key markets depend largely on consumer spending. Economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause our customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders.\nDifficulties or increased costs in obtaining capital and uncertain market conditions may also lead to a reduction of our sales and greater instances of nonpayment. These conditions may similarly affect our key suppliers, which could affect their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products. Further, these conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs and the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions could make it challenging for us to forecast our operating results and evaluate the risks that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGlobalization of sales increases risk of compliance with policy.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex sales environment around the world which places greater importance on our global control environment and imposes additional oversight risk. Such increased complexity could adversely affect our operating results by increasing compliance costs in the near-term and by increasing the impact of control failures in the event of non-compliance.\nOur legacy inverter products may suffer higher than anticipated litigation, damage, or warranty claims.\nOur legacy inverter products (of which we discontinued the manufacture, engineering, and sale in December 2015 and which are reflected as Discontinued Operations in this filing) contain components that may contain errors or defects and were sold with original product warranties ranging from one to ten years with an option to purchase additional warranty coverage for up to 20 years. If any of our products are defective or fail because of their design, we might be required to repair, redesign, or recall those products or to pay damages (including liquidated damages) or warranty claims, and we could suffer significant harm to our reputation. We are experiencing increasing claims from customers and suppliers and increasing litigation related to the legacy inverter product line. We review such claims and vigorously defend against such lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot assure that any such claims or litigation brought against us will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial statements. Our involvement in such litigation could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We also accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services including the cost of technical support, product repairs, and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired. Our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, our warranty accrual will increase, resulting in additional expenses in the line \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes\" on our Consolidated Statement of Operations in future periods. We plan to continue supporting inverter customers with service maintenance and repair operations. This includes performing service to fulfill obligations under existing service maintenance contracts. There is no certainty that these can be performed profitably and could be adversely affected by higher than anticipated product failure rates, loss of critical service technician skills, an inability to obtain service parts, customer demands and disputes and cost of repair parts, among other factors. See Note 4. Disposed and Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" contained herein.\nOur products may suffer from defects or errors leading to damage or warranty claims.\nOur products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. If any of our products are defective or fail because of their design, we might be required to repair, redesign, or recall those products, pay damages (including liquidated damages) or warranty claims, and we could suffer significant harm to our reputation. We accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services including the cost of technical support, product repairs, and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired. Our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, our warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit. In recent years, we have experienced increased warranty costs for our legacy inverter product lines, which is reflected in \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes.\" See Note 4. Disposed and Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" contained herein.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower operating margins, or may cause us to raise prices, which could result in reduced sales.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations, and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we have large, long term liabilities such as local lease and pension liabilities in Europe and Asia creating more significant exposure to fluctuations in the value of the Euro, Philippine Peso, and Chinese Yuan. The company does not attempt to hedge these exposures given the long-term nature of the underlying liabilities and the non-cash nature of the foreign exchange gain or loss.\nThe PRC government is continually pressured by its trading partners to allow its currency to float in a manner like other major currencies. Any change in the value of the Chinese yuan could significantly increase the labor and other costs incurred in the operation of our Shenzhen and Zhongshan facilities and the cost of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies that we source in the PRC, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union and related actions could adversely affect us.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (\"UK\") held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\"). On January 23, 2020, the UK left the EU, which is commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" and was in a transitionary period through December 31, 2020. As of January 1, 2021, EU Trade Agreements no longer apply to the UK. The UK has taken steps to reproduce the effects of trading agreements that previously applied through the provisional application of new trade agreements not yet ratified and has introduced the UK Global Tariff. These changes result in increased regulatory complexities on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries and may adversely affect our sales, operations, and financial results. Our operations in the UK may be adversely affected by significant fluctuations in the UK exchange rates and increased administrative costs and tariffs on the importation of parts for manufacturing and repair services. Moreover, the imposition of any import restrictions and duties levied on our UK products as imported for EU customers may make our products more expensive for such customers and less competitive from a pricing perspective.\nDifficulties with our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.\nLike many multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties. The acquisition of Artesyn added additional information systems that are initially different from current systems. Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by unauthorized access or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC. Any such failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions, or loss would likely cause a diversion of management\u2019s attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations. In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIf our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nAs part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system. Unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation, and possible liability. These security measures may be breached by intentional misconduct by computer hackers, because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not\nrecognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability, and negatively impact our future sales.\nWe have been, and in the future may again be, involved in litigation. Litigation is costly and could result in further restrictions on our ability to conduct business or make use of market relationships we have developed, or an inability to prevent others from using our technology.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our commercial or property rights, to defend ourselves against claimed violations of such rights of others, or to protect our interests in regulatory, tax, customs, commercial, and other disputes, or similar matters. We have been experiencing increased litigation related to our legacy inverter product line. Litigation often requires a substantial amount of our management\u2019s time and attention, as well as financial and other resources, including:\n\u25cf substantial costs in the form of legal fees, fines, and royalty payments;\n\u25cf restrictions on our ability to sell certain products or in certain markets;\n\u25cf an inability to prevent others from using technology we have developed; and\n\u25cf a need to redesign products or seek alternative marketing strategies.\nAny of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReturn on investments or interest rate declines on plan investments could result in additional unfunded pension obligations for our pension plan.\nWe currently have unfunded obligations to our pension plans. The extent of future contributions to the pension plan depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate used to calculate our future obligations and the actual return on plan assets which enable future payments. We estimate future contributions to the plan using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions. Additionally, a material deterioration in the funded status of the plan could increase pension expenses and reduce our profitability. See Note 17. Employee Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" contained herein.\nOur intangible assets may become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have $210.0 million of goodwill and $168.9 million in intangible assets. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value, or for intangible assets, a revised useful life. The events and circumstances include significant changes in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and could harm the trading price of our common stock.\nInternational trade, tax, and regulatory related risks\nSignificant developments stemming from recent U.S. government actions and proposals concerning tariffs and other economic proposals could have a material adverse effect on us.\nU.S. government actions are imposing greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. It has initiated the imposition of additional tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and aluminum, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and spare parts thereof and has also announced the imposition of import license requirements on aluminum articles. The government has amended and expanded export regulations regarding sales to companies on the U.S. Entity List. These changes prevent sales of foreign produced direct product of the U.S. that is manufactured using controlled U.S.-origin equipment, technology, and software located outside the United States to companies on the U.S. Entity List. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Defense continues to issue lists of companies it has determined to be owned or controlled by China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army on which sanctions could be levied by executive order, and the\nDepartment of Commerce has published their \"first tranche\" of designated military end users from China and Russia for whom export licenses are now required.\nFurthermore, the government has determined that the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to justify being treated as separate from China and has eliminated certain license exceptions for the export of controlled goods to Hong Kong and has removed Hong Kong as a separate shipping destination under the Export Administration Regulations (\"EAR\").\nIn response to U.S. Government actions, China passed the Export Control Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, effective December 1, 2020. The Export Control Law provides the Chinese government with the framework to ban exports of strategic materials and advanced technologies to specific foreign entities on its Control List and also provides a counterweight to the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions through provisions for retaliatory action and extraterritorial jurisdiction.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. As indicated above, these measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the U.S. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on goods and services sold. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the U.S. increase the price of semiconductor equipment and related parts imported into the U.S., the cost of our materials may be adversely affected and the demand from customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop and sell products, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. In addition, negative sentiments towards the United States among non-U.S. customers and among non-U.S. employees or prospective employees could adversely affect sales or hiring and retention, respectively.\nIncreased governmental action on income tax regulations could negatively impact our business.\nInternational governments have heightened their review and scrutiny of multinational businesses like ours which could increase our compliance costs and future tax liability to those governments. As governments continue to look for ways to increase their revenue streams, they could increase audits of companies to accelerate the recovery of monies perceived as owed to them under current or past regulations. Such an increase in audit activity could have a negative impact on companies which operate internationally, as we do.\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates, or mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions in which we do business, could impact our future tax liabilities and related corporate profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions by their nature are complex and may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and earnings higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative\npractices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union, and several other countries are actively considering changes in this regard.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes, regulations, and interpretations of foreign-derived intangible income (\"FDII\"), global intangible low-tax income (\"GILTI\") and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws (\"BEAT\"); by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\"), an international association comprised of 36 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, because of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject of regular examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nRegulatory authorities around the world have implemented or are considering several legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, including measures to ensure that encryption of users\u2019 data does not hinder law enforcement agencies\u2019 access to that data. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These legislative and regulatory proposals, if adopted, and such interpretations could, in addition to the possibility of fines, result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations and regulations relating to the design and operation of our products and control systems and regulations governing the import, export and customs duties related to our products. We might incur significant costs as we seek to ensure that our products meet safety and emissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products to comply with these directives. In addition, with our acquisition of Versatile Power, Inc., we expanded our presence in the medical market to include more highly regulated applications and added its medical-certified manufacturing center to our operating footprint. We may encounter increased costs to maintain compliance with the quality systems and other regulations and requirements that apply to the acquired business. Compliance with future regulations, directives, and standards could require us to modify or redesign some products, make capital expenditures, or incur substantial costs. Also, we may incur significant costs in complying with the\nnumerous imports, exports, and customs regulations as we seek to sell our products internationally. If we do not comply with current or future regulations, directives, and standards:\n\u25cf we could be subject to fines and penalties;\n\u25cf our production or shipments could be suspended; and\n\u25cf we could be prohibited from offering particular products in specified markets.\nIf we were unable to comply with current or future regulations, directives and standards, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFinancial reform legislation will result in new laws and regulations that may increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We must perform sufficient due diligence to determine whether such minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. Regarding our acquisition of Artesyn, we will need to complete due diligence on the minerals used in the manufacture of those products and include our due diligence results in our next conflict minerals report. In addition, we incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur failure to maintain appropriate environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") practices and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.\nGovernments, investors, customers, and employees are enhancing their focus on ESG practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving and increasing. While we monitor the various and evolving standards and associated reporting requirements, failure to adequately maintain appropriate ESG practices that meet diverse stakeholder expectations may result in the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers, and an inability to attract and retain top talent.", "PERMNO": 82547, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "AEIS"}
