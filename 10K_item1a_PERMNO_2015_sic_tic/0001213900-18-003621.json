{"cik": "811641", "company": "IMMUCELL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nProjection of net income: Generally speaking, our financial performance can differ significantly from management projections, due to numerous factors that are difficult to predict or that are beyond our control. Weaker than expected sales of the First Defense\u00ae product line could lead to less profits or an operating loss. Large investments in product development (or cost overruns) can result in a net loss. We were profitable on a year-to-date basis from the second half of 2014 through the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017. Depreciation expenses related to the Nisin production facility are expected to produce operating losses until and unless product sales increase to offset these non-cash expenses.\nReliance on sales of the First Defense\u00d2 product line: We are heavily reliant on the market acceptance of the First Defense\u00d2 product line to generate product sales and fund our operations. Our business would not have been profitable during the nine consecutive years in the period ended December 31, 2007 or during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016 or during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 without the gross margin that we earned on sales of the First Defense\u00d2 product line, which accounted for 94% and 93% of our total product sales during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGross margin on product sales: It is one of our goals to continue to achieve a gross margin (before related depreciation expenses) as a percentage of total sales consistent with current results (approximately 50%) after the initial launch of new products. Many factors discussed in this report impact our costs of goods sold. There is a risk that we are not able to achieve our gross margin goals, which could impact our future operating plans.\nProduct risks generally: The sale of our products is subject to financial, efficacy, regulatory, competitive and other market risks. Elevated standards to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance required to sell our products continue to evolve. Failure to achieve acceptable biological yields from our production processes can increase our costs of goods sold materially. There is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market acceptance at a profitable price level or that we can continue to manufacture our products at a low enough cost to result in a sufficient gross margin to justify their continued manufacture and sale.\nProduct liability: The manufacture and sale of our products entails a risk of product liability. Our exposure to product liability is mitigated to some extent by the fact that our products are principally directed towards the animal health market. We have maintained product liability insurance in an amount which we believe is reasonable in relation to our potential exposure in this area. We have no history of claims of this nature being made.\nRegulatory requirements for the First Defense\u00d2 product line: First Defense\u00d2 is sold in the United States subject to a product license from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA, which was first obtained in 1991. The potency of serial lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims (the \u201cReference Standard\u201d). Due to the unique nature of the First Defense\u00d2 label claims, host animal re-testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability of stored Reference Standard. To date, these analyses have demonstrated strong stability. However, if the USDA were not to approve requalification of the Reference Standard, additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales of the product. We expect to be subject to similar regulatory oversight risks in territories outside of the United States where we sell our products.\nRegulatory requirements for our purified Nisin product: The commercial introduction of this product in the United States will require us to obtain FDA approval. Completing the development through to the submission of the administrative NADA to the FDA involves risk. While three Technical Sections have been approved and the Human Food Safety Technical Section is near completion, the development process timeline has been extensive (18 years) and has involved multiple commercial production strategies. As a result, the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Technical Section (the approval of which is a precondition to commencement of sales of our mastitis product) has not yet been submitted for the Nisin Drug Substance or the Drug Product. To reduce the risk associated with this process, we have met with the FDA on multiple occasions to align on filing strategy and requirements. We have disclosed a timeline of events that could lead to potential approval by late 2019 to early 2020; however, there remains a risk that approval could be delayed or not obtained. We are exposed to additional regulatory compliance risks through the subcontractors that we choose to work with to produce our mastitis product, who also need to satisfy certain regulatory requirements in order to provide us with the products and services we need. International regulatory approvals would be required for sales outside of the United States. European regulatory authorities are not expected to approve a product with a zero milk discard claim, which would remove a significant competitive advantage in that territory. However, the assigned milk discard period may be shorter for our product than it is for other products on the market in Europe.\nConcentration of sales: Approximately 98% and 99% of our product sales were made to customers in the dairy and beef industries throughout the world during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 82% and 85% of our product sales were made to customers in the U.S. dairy and beef industries during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The animal health distribution segment has been aggressively consolidating over the last few years with larger distributors acquiring smaller distributors. A large portion of our product sales (64% and 60% during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) was made to two large distributors. A large portion of our trade accounts receivable (69% and 64% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) was due from these two distributors. We have a good history with these distributors, but the concentration of sales and accounts receivable with a small number of customers does present a risk to us, including risks related to such customers experiencing financial difficulties or altering the basis on which they do business with us.\nImmuCell Corporation\nEconomics of the dairy and beef industries:\n\u25cf The January count of all cattle and calves in the United States had steadily declined from 97,000,000 as of January 1, 2007 to 88,500,000 as of January 1, 2014. Then this figure increased to 89,100,000 as of January 1, 2015 and to 91,900,000 as of January 1, 2016 and to 93,700,000 as of January 1, 2017 and to 94,400,000 as of January 1, 2018, which is 0.7% higher than at January 1, 2017.\n\u25cf From 1998 through 2017, the size (annual average) of the U.S. dairy herd ranged from approximately the low of 9,011,000 (2004) to the high of 9,392,000 (2017).\n\u25cf While the number of cows in the U.S. herd and the production of milk per cow directly influence the supply of milk, demand for milk is also influenced by very volatile international demand for milk products. The Class III milk price (an industry benchmark that reflects the value of product used to make cheese) is an important indicator because it defines our customers\u2019 revenue level. This annual average milk price level (measured in dollars per hundred pounds of milk) for 2014 of $22.34 (peaking at $24.60 in September 2014) was the highest level since these prices were first reported in 1980. This strong price level declined to the average of $15.80 during 2015 and further declined to $14.87 during 2016 but increased by 9% to $16.17 during 2017. However, most projections call for a decline in this price level during 2018. The recent annual fluctuations in this milk price level are demonstrated in the following table:\n\u25cf The actual level of milk prices may be less important than its level relative to feed costs. One measure of this relationship is known as the milk-to-feed price ratio, which represents the amount of feed that one pound of milk can buy. The annual average for this ratio of 1.52 in 2012 was the lowest recorded since this ratio was first reported in 1985. The highest annual average this ratio has reached since 1985 was 3.64 in 1987. Since this ratio reached 3.24 in 2005, it has not exceeded 3.0. The annual average of 2.54 for 2014 was the highest this ratio has been since it was 2.81 in 2007. This ratio dropped to an annual average of 2.12 during 2015 and increased to 2.24 during 2016 and increased further to 2.42 during 2017. The following table demonstrates the annual volatility and the low values of this ratio recently:\nImmuCell Corporation\n\u25cf An increase in feed costs also has a negative impact on the beef industry. Widespread severe drought conditions in key U.S. agricultural regions during 2012 drove feed costs higher and the inventory of all cattle and calves lower. The positive trend in these market indices during 2013 and 2014 resulted in an increase in the value of milk cows. The 2014 annual average price for a milk cow increased by 32% to $1,835 in comparison to 2013. Previously, this annual average price since 1970 was only higher when it reached $1,840 in 2007 and $1,953 in 2008. This annual average price for 2015 increased by 9% to $1,993 in comparison to 2014, but this average price declined by 11% to $1,768 during 2016. The average for 2017 declined by 8% to $1,623. The industry data referred to above is compiled from USDA databases. The value of newborn bull calves had risen to the unusually high level of approximately $300 to $400 during 2015 but has declined to very little presently, depending on region. Given our focus on the dairy and beef industries, the volatile market conditions and the resulting financial insecurities of our primary end users are risks to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable level. These factors also heighten the challenge of selling premium-priced animal health products (such as Tri-Shield\u2122 First Defense\u00d2 and our novel mastitis treatment product) into the dairy market.\nProduct development risks: The development of new products is subject to financial, scientific, regulatory, and market risks. Our current business growth strategy relies heavily on the development of our new product to treat subclinical mastitis, which has required (and will continue to require) a substantial investment. Our efforts will be subject to inspection and approval by the FDA. There is no assurance whether or when we will obtain all of the data necessary to support regulatory approval for this product.\nRisks associated with our funding strategy for our purified Nisin product: Producing our pharmaceutical-grade Nisin at commercial-scale is the most critical action in front of us on our path to U.S. regulatory approval for this product. We believe our current cash and investments will be adequate financing to complete the project. However, due to the risks described herein, we could fail to generate sufficient cash to fully fund that project, and we could experience cost overruns or delays. Having substantially completed construction of the production facility described elsewhere in this report at a cost of approximately $21 million, we do not know whether we will receive the necessary regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell the product, or whether the product will achieve market acceptance and profitability. The additional debt we incurred to fund this project will significantly increase our debt service costs going forward. These loans are subject to certain financial covenants. Absent sufficient sales of this new product at a profitable gross margin, we would be required to fund all debt service costs from sales of the First Defense\u00d2 product line, which would reduce, and could eliminate, our expected profitability going forward and significantly reduce our cash flows.\nUncertainty of market size and product sales estimates: Estimating the size of the market for any new product is subject to numerous uncertainties. Some of the uncertainties surrounding our product include market acceptance, the development of the subclinical mastitis treatment market, the effect of a premium selling price on market penetration, competition from existing products sold by substantially larger competitors, the risk of competition from other new products, cost of manufacture and integration of milk from treated cows with susceptible cheese starter cultures. Given what we believe to be reasonable assumptions, we estimate that the market potential for first year sales of our new product could be approximately $5.8 million and could grow to approximately $36.1 million during the fifth year after market launch. The amount of sales that we can capture from this estimated market potential and the timing of when this can be achieved is very difficult to know, and the actual size of the market for our new product may differ materially from our estimates (up or down).\nCompetition from others: Many of our competitors are significantly larger and more diversified in the relevant markets than we are and have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development capabilities than we do, including greater ability to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and declining revenues and/or profitability. Boehringer Ingelheim, Elanco, Merck (a recent entry into this market space) and Zoetis, among other companies, sell products that compete directly with the First Defense\u00d2 product line in preventing scours in newborn calves. The scours product sold by Elanco (which has a similar selling price to our product) experienced a lack of supply in the market during late 2014 and into the middle of 2015 but returned to the market in the latter part of 2015 and is regaining sales it had lost during this period. The scours product sold by Zoetis sells for approximately half the price of our product, but it does not have an E. coli claim (which we do have). The market for the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows is highly competitive, and presently is dominated by large companies such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck and Zoetis. The mastitis products sold by these large companies are well established in the market but are all sold subject to a requirement to discard milk during and for a period of time after treatment. There is no assurance that our product will compete successfully in this market. We may not be aware of other companies that compete with us or intend to compete with us in the future.\nImmuCell Corporation\nAccess to raw materials and contract manufacturing services: Our objective is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used to manufacture and test our products that we obtain from third parties. However, there is a risk that we could have difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies. We have significantly increased the number of farms from which we purchase colostrum. The loss of farms from which we buy raw material for the First Defense\u00d2 product line could make it difficult for us to produce enough inventory to meet customer demand. The specific antibodies that we purify from colostrum for the First Defense\u00d2 product line are not readily available from other sources. We are and will be dependent on our manufacturing facilities and operations in Portland for the production of the First Defense\u00d2 product line and Nisin. We are and will be dependent on Plas-Pak Industries, Inc. (now owned by Nordson Corporation) for the supply of the syringes used for our gel tube format of First Defense Technology\u00d2, Tri-Shield\u2122 First Defense\u00d2 and our anticipated new mastitis product. The supply contract covering the mastitis syringes has been extended to January 1, 2024. We expect to be dependent on a contract with Norbrook for the formulation, aseptic filling and final packaging of our Nisin Drug Substance into Drug Product. If we do not achieve FDA approval of the Nisin product by late 2019, we would be liable for a $100,000 termination fee under this agreement. We are currently negotiating certain contract modifications and a term extension with Norbrook but are at risk of non-extension of the contract or extension at less favorable terms. We are evaluating alternative sources for these services for potential use post-approval, but given the requirement that such a facility be inspected and approved by the FDA, it could be costly and time-consuming to find and qualify an adequate alternative source for these services. Any significant damage to or other disruption in the services at any of these third party facilities (including due to regulatory non-compliance) could adversely affect the production of inventory and result in significant added expenses and potential loss of future sales.\nProduction Capacity Constraints: The backlog of orders discussed elsewhere in this report is a risk to our business. Our plan to continue to expand the First Defense\u00d2 product line requires ongoing review of equipment capacity and utilization across the manufacturing value stream at the 56 Evergreen Drive facility as well as assessment of functional obsolescence and reliability of equipment. It is anticipated that we will need to add a third freeze dryer to the equipment train for the First Defense\u00d2 product line over the next two years at a cost of up to $2 million. Our current two freeze dryers are functioning at a utilization rate of approximately 80%. Other ancillary liquid processing equipment may be required. There is a risk that we are not able to achieve our production capacity growth objectives timely.\nSmall size; dependence on key personnel: We are a small company with 47 employees (including 5 part-time employees). As such, we rely on certain key employees to support different operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, manufacturing, managerial and sales and marketing personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA or FDA approval for new products, to maintain regulatory compliance with current products and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.\nFailure to protect intellectual property: In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through operational safeguards and contractual agreements. Reliance upon trade secret, rather than patent, protection may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our manufacturing techniques and processes. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or technology or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Other companies may have filed patent applications and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize our products or achieve our business goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to such patents on terms that are acceptable. There is also a risk that competitors could challenge the claims in patents that have been issued to us.\nImmuCell Corporation\nCost burdens of our reporting obligations as a public company: Operating a public company involves substantial costs to comply with reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nExposure to risks associated with the financial downturn and economic instability: The U.S. economy has come out of a recession, which was caused principally by the housing, credit and financial crises that began around 2008. However, such recent positive indications could prove temporary and further downturn could occur. The credit markets continue to be very turbulent and uncertain. Some observers believe that the housing market remains problematic for the overall U.S. economy, the United States has taken on too much national debt and the equity markets are overvalued. Interest rates are trending higher, and a significant portion of our bank debt currently bears interest at variable rates. This extraordinary period of instability in the U.S. economy and the financial markets has been troubling for many Americans and businesses. The European economy remains sluggish and precarious. Certain emerging markets also show signs of slower growth or, in some areas, downturns in economic performance. While we do price our products in U.S. dollars for all export markets, the strength of the dollar against weakening foreign currencies could reduce product demand in international markets. A combination of the conditions, trends and concerns summarized above could have a corresponding negative effect on our business and operations, including the demand for our products in the U.S. market and our ability to penetrate or maintain a profitable presence in international markets.\nBovine diseases: The potential for epidemics of bovine diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, Bovine Tuberculosis, Brucellosis and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) presents a risk to us and our customers. Documented cases of BSE in the United States have led to an overall tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal origin, especially bovine. First Defense\u00d2 is considered a veterinary medicine rather than a feed ingredient, and it is manufactured from bovine milk (colostrum), which is not considered a BSE risk material. Future regulatory action to increase protection of the human food supply could affect First Defense\u00d2, although presently we do not anticipate that this will be the case.\nBiological terrorism: The threat of biological terrorism is a risk to both the economic health of our customers and our ability to economically acquire and collect good quality raw material from our contract farms. Any act of widespread bioterrorism against the dairy industry could adversely affect our operations.\nCertain provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management: Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our Common Stock Rights Plan or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf limitations on the removal of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to refuse to redeem rights issued under our Common Stock Rights Plan or otherwise to limit or suspend its operation that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u25cf Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could depress the trading price of our common stock or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood of obtaining a premium for our common stock in an acquisition.\nImmuCell Corporation\nStock market valuation and liquidity: Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq: ICCC). Our average daily trading volume (although it has increased recently) is lower than the volume for most other companies and the bid/ask stock price spread can be larger and prices can be volatile, which could result in investors facing difficulty selling their stock for proceeds that they may expect or desire. There are companies in the animal health sector with market capitalization values that greatly exceed our current market capitalization of approximately $38,361,000 as of March 20, 2018. We currently have annual product sales of approximately $10,000,000. Before gross margin from the sale of new products is achieved, our market capitalization may be heavily dependent on the perceived potential for growth from our products under development.\nNo expectation to pay any dividends or repurchase stock for the foreseeable future: We do not anticipate paying any dividends to, or repurchasing stock from, our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to use cash to fund product development costs and investments in our facility and production equipment, and to increase our working capital and to reduce debt. Stockholders must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, current and anticipated needs for liquidity and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 11292, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ICCC"}
