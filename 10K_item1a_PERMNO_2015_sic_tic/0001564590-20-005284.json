{"cik": "1338749", "company": "POTLATCHDELTIC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The risks described below should carefully be considered together with the other information contained in this report.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nThe cyclical nature of our business could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe financial performance of our operations is affected by the cyclical nature of our business. The markets for timber, manufactured wood products and real estate are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. The demand for our timber and manufactured wood products is affected by the level of new residential construction, home repair and remodeling and commercial and industrial building activity, which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions, changes in unemployment, consumer confidence, interest rates, credit availability including homebuyers\u2019 ability to qualify for mortgages, availability of labor and developable land, population growth, weather conditions and other factors. The demand for logs is also affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices. Historical prices for our manufactured wood products have been volatile and we have limited direct influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our manufactured wood products. The demand for real estate can be affected by changes in factors such as interest rates, credit availability and economic conditions, as well as by the impact of federal, state and local land use and environmental protection laws.\nOur operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber.\nA variety of factors affect prices for timber, including factors affecting demand, such as changes in economic conditions, the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity, foreign demand, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and pest infestation, as well as changes in timber supply and other factors. All of these factors can vary by region, timber type (sawlogs or pulpwood logs) and species.\nTimber prices are also affected by changes in timber availability at the local, national and international level. On a local level, timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as unusual pest infestations or fires. Our timberlands are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi. As a result, we may be susceptible to adverse economic and other developments in these regions, including industry slowdowns, mill closures and curtailments, business layoffs or downsizing, relocations of businesses, changes in demographics, increases in real estate and other taxes and increased regulation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe closure of a mill in the regions where we own timber can have a material adverse effect on demand and therefore pricing. As the demand for paper nationwide continues to decline, closures of pulp mills have adversely affected the demand for pulpwood and wood chips in certain of the regions in which we operate. Also, demand in other parts of the world may affect timber prices in the markets in which we compete. For example, although we do not sell into the Asian markets, Asian demand can indirectly impact pricing and supply in North American timber and lumber markets.\nIn Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi, most timberlands are privately owned. Historically, increases in timber prices have often resulted in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands, including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations, causing a short-term increase in supply that has tended to moderate price increases. Decreases in timber prices have often resulted in lower harvest levels, causing short-term decreases in supply that have tended to moderate price decreases. In the South, timber growth rates have exceeded harvests during the past decade, which have led to an oversupply of timber in the region, which in turn has kept prices at relatively low levels.\nIn Idaho, where a greater proportion of timberland is government-owned, any substantial increase in timber harvesting from government-owned land could significantly reduce timber prices, which would harm our results of operations. For more than 20 years, environmental concerns and other factors have limited timber sales by federal agencies, which historically had been major suppliers of timber to the U.S. forest products industry, particularly in the West. Any reversal of policy that substantially increases timber sales from government-owned land could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWind and ice storms coupled with drought and mild winters have contributed to an outbreak of spruce bark beetle throughout Central European forests. This outbreak has resulted in killings of vast areas of timber leading to increased timber salvage operations and an oversupply of sawlogs in Central Europe. As a result, Central European export of logs and lumber are growing dramatically, particularly to China, which has been displacing exports from the U.S. and Canada. This shift in suppliers to the Chinese market has negatively impacted U.S. and Canadian export prices, the amount of volume being exported by the U.S. and Canada to China and may be a contributing factor to increased supply in the U.S. markets. Furthermore, as timber markets are impacted by foreign demand, our business may be impacted by supply chain disruptions due to public health crises and pandemics such as the coronavirus outbreak originating in China at the beginning of 2020. Although we cannot predict the amount or duration of increased availability of foreign supplied timber and lumber products or the impact other infestation, pandemics and weather events may have on prices, demand and supply in the market, to the extent there is a significant increase in foreign timber and lumber product supply to the market or a decrease in foreign demand over an extended period of time, we could experience lower price realization and lower income.\nWe may be unable to harvest timber or we may elect to reduce harvest levels due to market, weather and regulatory conditions, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur timber harvest levels and sales may be limited due to weather conditions, timber growth cycles, restrictions on access, availability of contract loggers and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources, as well as by other factors, including insufficient or excessive precipitation, damage by fire, pest infestation, disease and natural disasters such as ice storms, wind storms, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. Changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors. Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized, affecting only a limited percentage of our timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will be limited. We typically experience seasonally lower harvest activity during the winter and early spring due to weather conditions. Severe weather conditions and other natural disasters can also reduce seedling survival rates, impact the productivity of timberlands and disrupt the harvesting and delivery of logs. Our financial results and cash flows are dependent to a significant extent on our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels.\nOn a short-term basis, we may adjust our timber harvest levels in response to market conditions. Longer term, our timber harvest levels will be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands, sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another. In addition to timberland acquisitions and sales, future timber harvest levels may be affected by changes in estimates of long-term sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances, natural disasters, fires, pests, insects and other hazards, regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control.\nWe do not insure against losses of standing timber from fire or any other causes.\nThe volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be affected by natural disasters such as fire, pest infestation, disease, ice storms, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and other weather conditions and causes beyond our control. As is typical in the forest industry, we assume substantially all risk of loss to the standing timber we own from fire and other hazards because insuring for such losses is not practicable. Consequently, a reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. In addition, the geographic concentration of our property makes us more susceptible to adverse impacts from a single natural disaster and other factors that could negatively impact our timber production.\nOur businesses are affected by third-party logger and transportation availability and costs.\nOur business depends on the availability of third-party logging contractors, railcar and other types of ground transportation companies and is materially affected by the cost and availability of these service providers. Therefore, increases in the cost of fuel could negatively impact our financial results by increasing the cost\nassociated with logging activities and transportation services and could also result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services. Truck driver shortages could negatively impact our financial results by reducing the volume of delivered wood products.\nOur third-party transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control, such as disruption of transportation infrastructure, labor issues and natural disasters. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to timely deliver our products, including delivery of our wood products to our customers and delivery of wood fiber to our mills, could harm our supply chain, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our reputation.\nOur wood products are commodities that are widely available from other producers.\nBecause commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. Prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile. Our profitability with respect to these products depends, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs, which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control.\nThe wood products industry is highly competitive.\nThe markets for our wood products are highly competitive and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our lines of business. In addition, our wood products manufacturing facilities are relatively capital intensive, which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs. These conditions have contributed to substantial price competition, particularly during periods of reduced demand. Some of our wood products competitors may currently be lower-cost producers than we are or may benefit from weak currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and accordingly these competitors may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases. Wood products also are subject to significant competition from a variety of substitute products, including non-wood and engineered wood products. To the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressure from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur wood products are subject to competition from manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada. For decades, the U.S. and Canada have been in a dispute over pricing for softwood lumber entering the U.S., which has resulted in trade cases and negotiated agreements between the two countries. The U.S. and Canada signed a Softwood Lumber Agreement in 2006, which expired in October 2015. On November 25, 2016, the U.S. lumber industry filed a petition seeking injury determination with the U.S. International Trade Commission, and a petition seeking countervailing (CVD) and anti-dumping (AD) duties on Canadian lumber imports with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Final rulings on injury and CVD and AD duties went into effect on December 28, 2017. The combined CVD and AD cash deposit rate to be paid by most Canadian exporters was initially established at 20.23%. On February 3, 2020, the first annual administrative review set the CVD and AD combined deposit rate for 2017 at 8.37% and the combined deposit rate for 2018 at 8.21%, as a result of high lumber prices during the period of review. Final results impacting duty collection for the periods are expected to be issued in the summer of 2020. The Government of Canada has appealed the determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission supporting the AD/CVD duties as well as to challenge these duties in the World Trade Organization.\nThe governments of the U.S. and Canada continue to state publicly their intention to reach a negotiated settlement of these trade cases at some point in the future. Even if an agreement is successfully negotiated, there can be no assurance that it will at all times, or at any time, effectively create a fair-trade environment.\nIn recent years, structural grade certified plywood supplied from Brazil has seen continued expansion into the U.S. market. In September 2019, a coalition of U.S. domestic plywood producers filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, seeking damages and permanent injunctions requiring two certifying agencies in the U.S. to revoke the certifications they issued to 35 Brazilian plywood plants. The lawsuit claims the certifications amount to false advertising because the Brazilian plants produce plywood that does not meet the stringent strength properties indicated by the certification, and its introduction into the U.S. market at low prices caused a substantial decline in certified panel prices in the U.S. We are not a party to the lawsuit and while we\ncannot predict the lawsuit\u2019s outcome, should the certifying agencies successfully defend their certifications, additional lower cost Brazilian plywood may enter the U.S. markets and our business could be adversely affected.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could unexpectedly cease to operate due to a number of events, including unscheduled maintenance outages, prolonged power failures, equipment failures, raw material shortages, cyber-attacks, labor difficulties, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels, fire, ice storms, floods, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes or other catastrophes, terrorism or threats of terrorism, governmental regulations and other operational problems.\nWe cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage. Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income. Although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited, we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damages such as fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes and equipment failure. Such insurance may not be sufficient or may be cost prohibitive to cover all our damages.\nChanges in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.\nA number of factors, including availability of credit, a slowing of residential and commercial real estate development, population shifts and changes in demographics could reduce the demand for our real estate and negatively affect our results of operations. Changes in investor interest in purchasing timberlands could reduce our ability to execute sales of non-core timberlands and could also negatively affect our results of operations. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of current laws, or the enactment of new laws, regarding the use and development of real estate, or changes in the political composition of federal, state and local governmental bodies could lead to new or greater costs, delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our real estate business, profitability or financial condition.\nAdditionally, we have real estate development projects located in Central Arkansas, specifically, in and west of Little Rock, Arkansas and in Hot Springs, Arkansas. These real estate operations are particularly vulnerable to economic downturns, weather or other adverse events that may occur in this region and to competition from nearby commercial and residential housing developments. Our results of operations may be affected by the cyclicality of the homebuilding and real estate industries. Factors influencing these industries include changes in population growth, general and local economic conditions, weather, employment levels, consumer confidence and income, housing demand, new and existing housing inventory levels, availability and cost of financing, mortgage interest rates and foreclosures, and changes in government regulation regarding the environment, zoning, real estate taxes, and other local government fees. In addition, the tightening of credit and economic recession could delay or deter commercial and residential real estate activity and may affect our operating results.\nWe may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy.\nWe have pursued, and may continue to pursue, acquisitions of strategic timberland properties and other forest products assets. The markets for timberland and forest products assets are highly competitive. We intend to finance acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings, proceeds from asset dispositions or any combination thereof. In addition, it is uncertain whether any acquisitions we make will perform in accordance with our expectations. The failure to identify and complete acquisitions of suitable properties could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding protection of the environment, including those relating to:\n\u2022\nthe protection of timberlands;\n\u2022\nendangered species;\n\u2022\ntimber harvesting practices;\n\u2022\nrecreation and aesthetics;\n\u2022\nprotection and restoration of natural resources;\n\u2022\nair and water quality;\n\u2022\nclimate conditions and\n\u2022\nremedial standards for contaminated soil, sediments and groundwater.\nFailure to comply with these requirements can result in significant fines or penalties, as well as liabilities for remediation of contaminated sites, natural resource damages or alleged personal injury or property damage claims. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes, as well as changes in the political composition of federal, state and local governmental bodies, may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber and operate our manufacturing facilities and may adversely affect the ability of others to develop property we intend to sell for higher and better use purposes.\nOver time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. For example, the Clean Water Act and comparable state laws, regulations and best management practices programs protect water quality. As a result, our resource management activities adjacent to rivers and streams, as well as the point source discharges from our manufacturing facilities, are subject to strict regulation and there can be no assurance that our forest management and manufacturing activities will not be subject to increased regulation under the Clean Water Act in the future. We believe that these laws and regulations will continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, environmental groups and interested individuals may intervene in the regulatory processes in the locations where we own timberlands and operate our wood products mills. Delays or restrictions on our operations due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, harvesting timber under contract with federal or state agencies, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans or that require us to obtain permits before pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit, or even a threatened lawsuit, could delay harvesting on our timberlands or impact our ability to operate or invest in our wood products mills.\nSimilarly, the threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. A number of species on our timberlands have been, and in the future may be, protected under these laws. If current or future regulations or their enforcement become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits covering air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal that govern how we operate our facilities. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. Overall, it is expected that environmental compliance costs will likely increase over time as environmental requirements become more stringent and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.\nCertain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several liability on responsible parties, including current and former owners and operators of contaminated sites, for costs of investigation and remediation of contamination. They also impose liability for related damages to natural resources. We have in the past been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA at various locations. Additional information is discussed in Note 21: Commitments and Contingencies\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report and that information is incorporated herein by reference. It is possible that other facilities we own or operate, or formerly owned or operated, or timberlands we now own or acquire, could also become subject to liabilities under these laws. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe manage our manufacturing facilities and timberland operations to be in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot be certain, however, that situations that give rise to material environmental liabilities have occurred in the past, and may be discovered in the future and result in additional restrictions on us, leading to increased costs, additional capital expenditures and reduced operating flexibility.\nChanges in climate conditions and governmental responses to such changes may affect our operations or planned or future growth activities.\nThere continue to be increased social concerns over climate change and environmental issues, as well as numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. These initiatives include proposals to regulate and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy. Future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain, and its effect on our operations is unclear at this time. We manage our manufacturing facilities and timberland operations to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, it is possible that legislation or government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound or greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could adversely affect our operations. For example, such initiatives could limit harvest levels or result in significantly higher costs for energy and other raw materials, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nAdditionally, there is scientific research that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. Our operations and the operations of our suppliers are subject to climate variations, which impact the productivity of forests, the frequency and severity of wildfires, the distribution and abundance of species, and the spread of disease or insect epidemics, which in turn may adversely or positively affect timber production. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, snow, ice storms, the spread of disease, and insect infestations. Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts could make wildfires more frequent or more severe and could adversely affect timber production. Any of these natural disasters could affect our timberlands, harvest operations or cause variations in the cost of raw materials, such as virgin fiber which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nOur defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded.\nWe have qualified defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees which, in aggregate at December 31, 2019, were 91.6% funded. Future actions involving our defined benefit and other postretirement plans, such as annuity buyouts and lump-sum payouts could cause us to incur significant pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment charges and may require cash contributions to maintain a legally required funded status.\nThe measurement of the pension benefit obligation, determination of pension plan net periodic costs and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate applied to pension plan obligation as changes in long-term interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Changes in assumptions regarding discount rates could also increase future pension costs. Changes in any of these factors may significantly impact future contribution requirements. For additional information regarding this matter see Note 19: Savings Plans, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nA strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 14% of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which expires in 2020. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other non-unionized operations were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs. A strike or other work stoppage in the facilities of any of our major customers or suppliers could also have similar effects on us.\nWe rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication; a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business, force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm.\nWe use information systems to carry out our operational activities and maintain our business records. Some systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store small amounts of sensitive data, including personally identifiable information. Our ability to conduct business could be materially and adversely affected if these systems or resources are compromised, damaged or fail. This could be a result of a cyber incident, malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware), advanced persistent threats, phishing attacks, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption.\nAlthough we invest in the protection of data and information technology, including through regular employee training and awareness programs, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of confidential or protected data and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in various legal matters, disputes and proceedings that, if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in legal matters, disputes and proceedings (legal matters). In some cases, all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance; in other cases, any such losses will not be covered.\nAlthough the disclosures in Note 21: Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain management\u2019s current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any such legal matters will be as currently expected. It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some, and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends to stockholders and fulfill our debt obligations, our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund future needs.\nOur debt requires interest and principal payments. At December 31, 2019, we had total long-term debt of $762.2 million. Subject to the limits contained in our debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify.\nOur indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness or to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences for stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for dividends to stockholders, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have relatively less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for dividends to stockholders, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.\nA number of our debt instruments and associated interest rate derivative agreements have an interest rate tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR), backed by Treasury securities, which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question, and the future of LIBOR remains uncertain at this time. Our interest rate derivative agreements are governed by the International Swap Dealers Association (\"ISDA\"). ISDA is in the process of developing fallback language for derivative agreements and is expected to establish a protocol to allow counterparties to modify legacy trades to include the new fallback language.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. If LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders or interest rate swap counterparties have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates from our variable debt and interest rate derivatives, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. We are monitoring the developments with respect to the potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 and will work with our lenders and counterparties to identify a suitable replacement rate and amend our agreements to reflect this new reference rate accordingly. However, at this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to the effect of any changes to, or the discontinuation of LIBOR.\nWe depend on external sources of capital for future growth.\nOur ability to finance growth is dependent to a significant degree on external sources of capital. Our ability to access such capital on favorable terms could be hampered by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including a decline in general market conditions, decreased market liquidity, a downgrade to our public debt rating, increases in interest rates, an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, among other things, restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends. For additional details, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any of these factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us and the failure to obtain necessary capital could materially adversely affect our future growth.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets, increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. For additional detail on our credit ratings see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above under Business and Operating Risks and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors\u2019 operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of capacity change;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nour growth rate and our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe financial markets, interest rates and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour competitors or the forest products industry generally;\n\u2022\nfailure to pay cash dividends or the amount of cash dividends paid;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nIn addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance. Some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and that of our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent and stockholders cannot call a special meeting except upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nallowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nin order to facilitate the preservation of our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, a prohibition on any single stockholder, or any group of affiliated stockholders, from beneficially owning more than 9.8% of our outstanding common or preferred stock, unless our board waives or modifies this ownership limitation;\n\u2022\nunless approved by the vote of at least 80% of our outstanding shares, we may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock; and\n\u2022\nsupermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.\nREIT and Tax-Related Risks\nIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, income from our timberlands will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates and we will have reduced cash available for dividends to our stockholders.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations, including satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, dividend, stockholder ownership and other requirements, on an ongoing basis. Given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a REIT.\nIn addition, the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury). Changes to the tax laws affecting REITs or taxable REIT subsidiaries, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect our stockholders or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our stockholders or us. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that new legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, the determination of the amount of REIT taxable income or the amount of tax paid by the TRS.\nIf in any taxable year we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, unless we are entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code:\n\u2022\nwe would not be allowed a deduction for dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and\n\u2022\nwe would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.\nAny such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for dividends to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. In addition, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions. As a result, net income and the cash available for dividends to our stockholders could be reduced for at least five years, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends and service our indebtedness using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiary may be limited.\nOur board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the actual amount of dividends to be made to stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions in our industry and in the markets for our products, tax considerations, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions, timber prices, harvest levels on our timberlands, market demand for timberlands, including timberland properties we have identified as potentially having a higher and better use and future acquisitions and dispositions. For a description of debt covenants that could limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders in the future, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Consequently, the level of future dividends to our stockholders may fluctuate and any reduction in the dividend rate may adversely affect our stock price.\nUnder the REIT rules, to remain qualified as a REIT, a REIT must distribute, within a certain period after the end of each year, 90% of its ordinary taxable income for such year. Our REIT income, however, consists primarily of net capital gains resulting from payments received under timber cutting contracts with PotlatchDeltic TRS and third parties, rather than ordinary taxable income. Therefore, unlike most REITs, we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash to remain qualified as a REIT. If, after giving effect to our dividends, we have not distributed an amount equal to 100% of our REIT taxable income, then we would be required to pay tax on the undistributed portion of such taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and our stockholders would be required to include their proportionate share of any undistributed capital gain in income and would receive a credit or refund for their share of the tax paid by us.\nFurther, the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT limit our ability to use dividends from PotlatchDeltic TRS for the payment of stockholder dividends and to service our indebtedness. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of real estate income. No more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividends from PotlatchDeltic TRS and other non-qualifying types of income. This requirement may limit our ability to receive dividends from PotlatchDeltic TRS and may impact our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and service the REIT's indebtedness using cash from PotlatchDeltic TRS.\nCertain of our business activities are potentially subject to a prohibited transactions tax on 100% of our net income derived from such activities, which would reduce our cash flow and impair our ability to pay dividends.\nREITs are generally intended to be passive entities and can thus only engage in those activities permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, which for us generally include owning and managing a timberland portfolio, growing timber and selling standing timber.\nAccordingly, the manufacture and sale of wood products, certain types of timberland sales, sale of real estate and the harvest and sale of logs are conducted through PotlatchDeltic TRS because such activities generate non-qualifying REIT income and could constitute \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d if such activities were engaged in directly by the REIT. In general, prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code to be sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.\nBy conducting our business in this manner, we believe we will satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and thus avoid the 100% tax that could be imposed if a REIT were to conduct a prohibited transaction. We may not always be successful, however, in limiting such activities to PotlatchDeltic TRS. Therefore, we could be subject to the 100% prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur, which would adversely affect our cash flow and impair our ability to pay quarterly dividends.\nOur REIT structure may limit our ability to invest in our non-REIT qualifying operations.\nOur use of PotlatchDeltic TRS enables us to continue to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities consisting primarily of our wood products manufacturing, harvesting of timber, sale of logs, and sale of real estate and selected land parcels that we expect to be sold or developed for higher and better use purposes. However, under the Internal Revenue Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. This may limit our ability to make investments in our wood products manufacturing operations or in other non-REIT qualifying operations.", "PERMNO": 49744, "SIC": 2421, "TIC": "PCH"}
