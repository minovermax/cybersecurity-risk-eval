{"cik": "1368265", "company": "Clean Energy Fuels Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.-Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk of loss. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below and all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nIn 2012, 2013 and 2014, we incurred pre-tax losses of $99.6 million, $63.2 million, and $89.8 million, respectively. Our losses for 2012, 2013 and 2014 included derivative gains of $3.4 million, $0.9 million, and $5.7 million, respectively (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). During 2013 and 2014, our losses were substantially decreased by approximately $45.4 million and $28.4 million of revenue, respectively, from federal fuel tax credits, and the program under which we received such credits expired on December 31, 2014. We may never achieve or maintain profitability and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition, and may cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to repay our debt.\nAt December 31, 2014, our total consolidated indebtedness was $570.7 million, including an aggregate of $295.0 million principal amount of the 7.5% Notes and the SLG Notes (each as defined in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report), which are convertible notes we issued in July 2011, August 2011, July 2012, and June 2013 bearing interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum (the \"Series 2011 Notes\"), and an aggregate of $250.0 million principal amount of the 5.25% Notes (as defined in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report), which are convertible notes we issued in September 2013 bearing interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum (the \"Series 2013 Notes\"). Further, in connection with our investment in, and purchase of property from, NG Advantage LLC in October 2014, we obligated ourselves to pay an additional $20.5 million to NG\nAdvantage LLC in 2015, $3.0 million of which has been paid. As of December 31, 2014 NG Advantage had outstanding debt totaling $9.9 million. We expect our total consolidated interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness to be approximately $37.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2015. Approximately $4.8 million, $148.8 million, $4.1 million, $303.6 million and $53.1 million, respectively, of our consolidated indebtedness matures in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, including those described in these risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt. If we are, or if we expect that we will be, unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous to us or highly dilutive to our stockholders. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness, should we decide to do so, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at the desirable time, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Additionally, our existing and future indebtedness may contain various restrictive covenants, and any failure by us to comply with any of these covenants could also cause us to be in default under the agreements governing the indebtedness. In the event of any such default, the holders of the indebtedness could, among other things, elect to declare all amounts owed immediately due and payable, which could cause all or a large portion of our available cash flow to be used to pay such amounts and thereby reduce the amount of cash available to pursue our business plans or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, the substantial amount of our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation, limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry, place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt or limit our ability to borrow additional amounts. Further, we are permitted to repay the Series 2011 Notes and the Series 2013 Notes with shares of our common stock rather than cash, and any such issuances would increase the number of our outstanding shares.\nOur success is dependent upon fleets' and other consumers' willingness to adopt natural gas as a vehicle fuel.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the adoption by fleets and other consumers of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. If the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, or if a market does develop but we are not able to capture a significant share of the market or the market subsequently declines, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel is a relatively new, rapidly evolving market characterized by intense competition, evolving government regulation and industry standards and changing consumer demands and behaviors.\nFactors that may influence the adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel include, among others:\n\u2022 Increases, decreases or volatility in the price of and cost to produce or obtain oil, gasoline, diesel or natural gas;\n\u2022 The availability of natural gas and the price of natural gas compared to gasoline, diesel and other vehicle fuels;\n\u2022 Natural gas vehicle cost, availability, quality, safety, design and performance, all relative to other vehicles;\n\u2022 Improvements in the fuel economy of gasoline or diesel engines;\n\u2022 The entry or exit of engine manufacturers from the market;\n\u2022 Perceptions about greenhouse gas emissions (also known as \"fugitive methane emissions\") from natural gas production and transportation methods, as well as from natural gas vehicles;\n\u2022 The availability and acceptance of other alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles;\n\u2022 Access to natural gas fueling stations and the convenience and cost to fuel a natural gas vehicle;\n\u2022 The availability of service for natural gas vehicles;\n\u2022 The environmental consciousness of fleets and consumers;\n\u2022 The existence and success of government incentives and grant programs that promote the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel; and\n\u2022 Concerns with the content of the natural gas supplied by natural gas fueling stations.\nIncreases, decreases and general volatility in oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas prices could adversely impact our business.\nIn the recent past, the prices of oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas have been volatile, and this volatility may continue. Market adoption of CNG, LNG and RNG as vehicle fuels could be slowed, curtailed or otherwise limited if there are significant decreases in the prices of, or significant increases in the supply and availability of, gasoline and diesel, today's most prevalent and conventional vehicle fuels, which would decrease the market's perception of a need for alternative vehicle fuels generally, or if there are decreases in the prices of gasoline and diesel without a corresponding decrease in the price of natural gas or an increase in the price of natural gas without corresponding increases in the prices of gasoline and diesel. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could cause the success or perceived success of our industry and our business to materially suffer. Part of the reason that such slowed, curtailed or limited adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel might occur under these circumstances is due to the higher cost of natural gas vehicles compared to gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles, as the components needed for a vehicle to use natural gas add to a vehicle's base cost. If gasoline or diesel prices drop significantly, fuel economy of gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles improves, or the prices of CNG and LNG are not sufficiently low, operators may delay or avoid the purchase of natural gas vehicles or decide not to convert their existing vehicles to run on natural gas because of a perceived inability to recover in a timely manner the additional costs of acquiring or converting to natural gas vehicles. In addition, our profit margins are directly impacted by fluctuations in natural gas, gasoline and diesel prices. In order to attract fleet operators and other consumers to convert to natural gas vehicles, we must be able to offer CNG and LNG fuel at prices significantly lower than gasoline and diesel. Decreases in the price of gasoline and diesel and increases in the price of natural gas make it more difficult for us to offer our customers discounted prices for CNG and LNG as compared to gasoline and diesel prices and maintain an acceptable margin on our sales. Further, increased natural gas prices affect the cost to us of natural gas and adversely impact our operating margins in cases where we cannot pass the increased costs on to our customers, and conversely, lower natural gas prices reduce our revenues in cases where the commodity cost is passed through to our customers.\nAmong the factors that can cause fluctuations in gasoline, diesel and natural gas prices are changes in domestic and foreign supplies and availability of crude oil and natural gas, domestic storage levels, price and availability of alternative fuels (including natural gas as an alternative to gasoline and diesel and gasoline and diesel as an alternative to natural gas), weather conditions, negative publicity surrounding natural gas drilling techniques or methods or producing and importing oil, level of consumer demand, economic conditions, the price of foreign imports, and domestic and foreign governmental regulations and political conditions. With respect to natural gas supply, there have been recent efforts to place new regulatory requirements on the production of natural gas by hydraulic\nfracturing of shale gas reservoirs and on transporting and dispensing natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques has resulted in a substantial increase in the proven natural gas reserves in the United States, and any changes in regulations that make it more expensive or unprofitable to produce natural gas through such techniques or others, as well as any changes to the regulations relating to transporting or dispensing natural gas, could lead to increased natural gas prices. Additionally, crude oil prices have recently been subject to extreme volatility and decreases, due in part to over-production and increased supply without a corresponding increase in demand. If these circumstances continue, or if all or some combination of the factors contributing to volatile natural gas, oil and diesel prices were to occur or worsen, perceptions about the success of our industry could be materially harmed, which could cause our stock price to decline and could cause our results of operations and prospects to suffer.\nIf trucks using the Cummins Westport ISX 12G natural gas engine (or a comparable engine) are not adopted by truck operators as quickly or to the extent we anticipate, our results of operations and business prospects will be adversely affected.\nWe believe the development and expansion of the U.S. natural gas heavy-duty truck market, and the execution of our America's Natural Gas Highway initiative, depends upon the successful adoption of the Cummins Westport ISX 12G natural engine (or a comparable engine) and the development of a meaningful market in the U.S. for heavy-duty natural-gas trucks. Manufacturers may not produce natural gas engines and truck operators may not adopt and deploy natural gas trucks in meaningful numbers or as quickly as we anticipate. Heavy-duty trucks powered by natural gas engines cost more, as compared to comparable gasoline or diesel trucks, and may experience, or be perceived to experience, more operational or performance issues. If meaningful numbers of natural gas heavy-duty truck engines are not deployed, if such deployment is slower than expected, or if a meaningful number of the trucks that are deployed are not fueled at our stations, our business and financial results would be harmed.\nThe failure of our America's Natural Gas Highway initiative and our inability to achieve our goal to fuel a substantial number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks would materially and adversely affect our financial results and business.\nWe are seeking to fuel a substantial number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks, and in connection with that effort we are building America's Natural Gas Highway, a network of natural gas truck-friendly fueling stations. Our objectives to fuel a substantial number of heavy-duty trucks and build America's Natural Gas Highway have required, and will continue to require, a significant commitment of capital and other resources, and our ability to successfully execute our plans faces substantial risks, including, among others:\n\u2022 Many of our existing ANGH stations were initially built to provide LNG and LNG costs more than CNG on an energy equivalent basis. If CNG becomes the preferred fuel for truck operators, we will be required to spend significant additional capital to add CNG fueling capability to many of our ANGH stations, and we may not have sufficient capital for that purpose;\n\u2022 Our ANGH stations may experience mechanical or operational difficulties, which could require significant costs to repair and could reduce customer confidence in our stations;\n\u2022 Truck and vehicle operators may not fuel at our stations due to lack of access or convenience, prices, concerns with natural gas content or reliability or numerous other factors;\n\u2022 We have no influence over the development, production, cost or availability of natural gas trucks powered by engines that are well-suited for the U.S. heavy-duty truck market. At December 31, 2014, there was only one principal natural gas engine manufacturer for the medium- and heavy-duty market, Cummins Westport (\"CWI\"). We have no control over whether CWI will remain in\nthe natural gas engine business or whether other manufacturers will enter the natural gas engine business;\n\u2022 Operators may not adopt heavy-duty natural gas trucks due to cost, actual or perceived performance issues, or other factors that are outside our control;\n\u2022 We may not be able to obtain acceptable margins on fuel sales at ANGH stations; and\n\u2022 Many ANGH stations (approximately 92 stations at December 31, 2014) were completed before there were sufficient numbers of customers that will fuel at the stations, and if such customers do not materialize, we will continue to have substantial investments in assets that do not produce revenues equal to or greater than their costs and we may lose money on LNG that is supplied to the stations but is not purchased by customers.\nWe must effectively manage these risks and any other risks that may arise in connection with the ANGH build-out to successfully execute our business plan. If the U.S. market for heavy-duty natural gas trucks does not develop or if we fail to successfully execute our ANGH initiative and fuel a substantial number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks, our financial results, operations and business, and our ability to repay our debt, will be materially and adversely affected.\nAutomobile and engine manufacturers produce very few natural gas vehicles and engines for the United States and Canadian markets, which limits our customer base and our sales of CNG, LNG and RNG.\nLimited availability of natural gas vehicles and engine sizes, including heavy-duty trucks and other types of vehicles, restricts their large-scale introduction and narrows our potential customer base. Original equipment manufacturers produce a relatively small number of natural gas engines and vehicles in the U.S. and Canadian markets, and they may not decide to expand, or they may decide to discontinue or curtail, their existing natural gas engine or vehicle product lines. A limited supply of natural gas vehicles limits our customer base and natural gas fuel sales and encourages existing manufacturers to charge a premium for such vehicles, thereby restricting our ability to promote natural gas vehicles, all of which has a negative impact on our business, operations and prospects.\nWe may need to raise additional debt or equity capital to continue to fund the growth of our business.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $92.4 million and short-term investments of $122.5 million. Our business plan calls for approximately $58.3 million in capital expenditures for 2015, as well as substantial capital expenditures thereafter. We may also require capital to make principal or interest payments on our indebtedness or for unanticipated expenses, mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments. As a result, we may find it necessary to raise additional capital through selling current assets or pursuing debt or equity financing.\nAsset sales and equity or debt financing options may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any sale of our assets may limit our operational capacity and could limit or eliminate any business plans that are dependent on the sold assets. Additional issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would increase the number of our outstanding shares. We may also pursue debt financing since, despite our level of consolidated debt, the agreements governing much of our existing debt do not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured and unsecured indebtedness, or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Debt financing options that we may pursue include, among others, equipment financing, the sale of convertible notes, high yield debt, asset -based loans, term loans, project finance debt, municipal bond financing or commercial bank financing. Any debt financing we obtain may require us to make significant interest payments and to pledge some or all of our assets as security. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness could increase the risk that we would be unable to repay our debt or make other required\npayments and could adversely affect our creditworthiness, which could limit our ability to obtain further debt or equity financing as needed and restrict our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, any of which could negatively impact our business and prospects. On the other hand, if we are unable to obtain capital in amounts sufficient to fund our contractual obligations, our business plan, and any unanticipated expenses, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions or strategic investments, we would be forced to suspend, delay or curtail these capital expenditures or other transactions, which would harm our business, results of operations, and future prospects.\nOur business is influenced by environmental, tax and other government regulations, programs and incentives promoting cleaner burning fuels and alternative fuel vehicles, and their modification or repeal could adversely impact our business.\nOur business is influenced by federal, state and local government tax attributes, credits, rebates, grants and similar programs and incentives that promote the use of natural gas and RNG as a vehicle fuel, as well as by laws, rules and regulations that require reductions in carbon emissions. Industry participants with a vested interest in gasoline and diesel or alternative fuels such as hydrogen- or electric-powered vehicles, many of which have substantially greater resources than we have, invest significant time and money in efforts to influence environmental regulations in ways that could delay or repeal regulations and programs that promote natural gas as a vehicle fuel. Any failure to adopt, delay in implementing, expiration, repeal or modification of federal, state or local regulations, programs or incentives that encourage the use of natural gas and RNG as a vehicle fuel would harm our operating results and financial condition. For example, some such government programs and incentives have recently expired, such as the VETC of $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG and liquid gallon of LNG sold for vehicle fuel use, which expired December 31, 2014 and has not been reinstated. In 2013 and 2014 we recorded approximately $45.4 million and $28.4 million of revenue, respectively, related to VETC fuel tax credits, representing approximately 12.9% and 6.6%, respectively, of our total revenue during the periods. Additionally, changes to or the repeal of laws, rules and regulations that mandate reductions in carbon emissions and/or the use of renewable fuels, including the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the federal RFS Phase 2, under which we generate LCFS Credits and RIN Credits by selling natural gas and RNG as a vehicle fuel, would adversely affect our financial condition. For example, the staff of the the California Air Resources Board recently proposed changing its carbon intensity number for CNG, LNG and RNG to take into account alleged system-wide methane losses, which change, if implemented, would result in fewer carbon benefits associated with use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and would adversely affect our business. Further, the failure of any proposed federal, state or local government incentives that promote the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, the use of renewable fuels or reductions in carbon emissions to pass into law could result in a negative perception of our industry and business by the market generally and could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock. Additionally, if grant funds cease to be available under government programs for the purchase and construction of natural gas vehicles and stations, these activities could slow and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe face increasing competition from oil and gas and other alternative fuel and alternative fuel vehicle companies, fuel providers, refuse companies, industrial gas companies, natural gas utilities, fuel station and truck stop owners, and other organizations that may have far greater resources and brand awareness than we have.\nA significant number of established businesses, including oil and gas companies, other alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, natural gas utilities and their affiliates, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers and other organizations have entered or are planning to enter the markets for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuels. Additionally, for certain of our key customer markets, such as airports, taxis and paratransit vehicles, we indirectly compete with companies providing alternative transportation means\nthat may limit these markets generally, such as Uber and Lyft. Many of these current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and other resources than we have. Further, new technologies and improvements to existing technologies may make alternatives other than natural gas more attractive to the market, or may slow the development of a market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel if such advances are made with respect to oil and gas usage. Natural gas utilities also own and operate natural gas fueling stations that compete with our stations. The California Public Utilities Commission has approved a compression services tariff application by the Southern California Gas Company, allowing the utility to compete with us by building and owning natural gas compression equipment on customer property and by providing operation and maintenance services to customers. Further, utilities in several other states, including Michigan, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Maryland, Washington, Kentucky and Georgia, either have or are preparing to enter the natural gas vehicle fuel business. Utilities, in particular, have unique competitive advantages, including their typically lower cost of capital, substantial and predictable cash flows, long-standing customer relationships, greater brand awareness and large and well-trained sales and marketing organizations.\nWe expect competition to intensify in the near term in the alternative vehicle fuels market generally and, assuming the use of natural gas vehicles and the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel increases, the market for natural gas vehicle fuel. Increased competition will lead to amplified pricing pressure and reduced operating margins. Our failure to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf there are advances in other alternative vehicle fuels or technologies, or if there are improvements in gasoline, diesel or hybrid engines, demand for natural gas vehicles may decline and our business would suffer.\nTechnological advances in the production, delivery and use of alternative fuels that are, or are perceived to be, cleaner, more cost-effective or more readily available than CNG, LNG or RNG have the potential to slow or limit adoption of natural gas vehicles. Advances in gasoline and diesel engine technology, especially hybrids, may offer a cleaner, more cost-effective option and make fleet customers less likely to convert their fleets to natural gas. Technological advances related to ethanol or biodiesel, which are increasingly used as an additive to, or substitute for, gasoline and diesel fuel, may slow the need to diversify fuels and affect the growth of the natural gas vehicle market. Use of electric heavy-duty trucks, buses and trash trucks, or the perception that such vehicles may soon be widely available and provide satisfactory performance, may reduce demand for natural gas vehicles. In addition, hydrogen and other alternative fuels in experimental or developmental stages may offer a cleaner, more cost-effective alternative to gasoline and diesel than natural gas. Advances in technology that slow or curtail the growth of or conversion to natural gas vehicles, or which otherwise reduce demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel, will have an adverse effect on our business. Failure of natural gas vehicle technology to advance at a sufficient pace may also limit its adoption and our ability to compete with other alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our station construction and similar activities, including difficulties identifying suitable station locations, zoning, permitting or other local resistance, cost overruns, delays, and other contingencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn connection with our station construction operations, we may not be able to identify, obtain and retain sufficient permits, approvals and other rights to use suitable locations for the stations we or our customers seek to build. We may also encounter land use or zoning difficulties or other local resistance with respect to stations that prohibits us or our customers from building new stations on preferred sites or limits or restricts the use of new or existing stations. Any such difficulties, resistance or limitations could damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we act as the general contractor and construction manager for station construction and facility modification\nprojects and typically rely on licensed subcontractors to perform the construction work. We may be liable for any damage we or our subcontractors cause during the course of our projects. Shortages of skilled subcontractor labor for our projects could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. Our profit on our projects is based in part on assumptions about the cost of the projects. Cost overruns, delays or other execution issues may, in the case of projects that we complete and sell to customers, result in our failure to achieve our expected margins or cover our costs, and in the case of projects that we build and own, result in our failure to achieve an acceptable rate of return.\nOur manufacturing operations could subject us to significant costs and other risks, including product liability claims.\nOur subsidiary, IMW, designs, manufactures, sells and services non-lubricated natural gas compressors and related equipment used in CNG stations. The equipment IMW produces and sells has not in some instances performed, and may not in the future perform, as expected, according to legal or other specifications, or at all. IMW has in the past and may in the future incur significant and unexpected costs in the product life cycle, including costs incurred to fix any discovered performance errors and to repair any product malfunctions. The scope and likelihood of these risks continues to increase as IMW makes efforts to expand its services to new geographic and other markets. The occurrence of any of these risks has and will damage our customer relationships and reputation, delay the launch of new IMW products, force product recalls and/or result in product liability claims, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur warranty reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations and increased or unexpected product warranty claims could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide product warranties with varying terms and durations for natural gas compressors and stations we build and sell to customers, and we establish reserves for the estimated liability associated with our product warranties. Our warranty reserves are based on historical trends as well as our understanding of specifically identified warranty issues. The amounts estimated could differ materially from actual warranty costs that may ultimately be realized. An increase in the rate of warranty claims, the average amount involved with each warranty claim or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nThe global scope of our operations exposes us to additional risks and uncertainties.\nOur IMW subsidiary has operations in a number of countries, including the United States, Canada, China, Colombia, Bangladesh and Peru. IMW's natural gas compression equipment is primarily manufactured in Canada and sold globally, which exposes us to a number of risks that can arise from international trade transactions, local business practices and cultural considerations. In addition to the other risks described in these risk factors, the global scope of our operations may subject us to risks and uncertainties that may limit our operations, increase our costs or otherwise negatively impact our business and financial condition, including, among others:\n\u2022 Compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022 Political unrest, terrorism, war, natural disasters and economic and financial instability;\n\u2022 Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and uncertainty related to developing legal and regulatory systems governing economic and business activities, real property ownership and application of contract rights;\n\u2022 Trade restrictions and import-export regulations;\n\u2022 Difficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;\n\u2022 Difficulties complying with the laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022 Difficulties ensuring that health, safety, environmental and other working conditions are properly implemented and/or maintained by the local office;\n\u2022 Differing employment practices and/or labor issues, including wage inflation, labor unrest and unionization policies;\n\u2022 Limited intellectual property protection;\n\u2022 Longer payment cycles by international customers;\n\u2022 Inadequate local infrastructure and disruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers, including electricity shortages; and\n\u2022 Potentially adverse tax consequences.\nIn addition to the above, we also face risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings as a result of our foreign operations. In some countries, economic, monetary and regulatory factors could affect our ability to convert funds to United States dollars or move funds from accounts in these countries. We are also vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the United States dollar, which could negatively impact our operating results and financial performance.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our business would be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our executive officers, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, technical and finance personnel. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. All of our executive officers and other United States employees may terminate their employment relationships with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. If we are unable to retain our executive officers and key employees or, if such individuals leave our company, we are unable to attract and successfully integrate quality replacements, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe have significant contracts with federal, state and local government entities that are subject to unique risks.\nWe have, and will continue to seek, long-term CNG, LNG and RNG station construction, maintenance and fuel sales contracts with various federal, state and local governmental bodies, which accounted for approximately 33%, 19% and 18% of our annual revenues in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. In addition to normal business risks, our contracts with these government entities are often subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. The termination of funding for a government program supporting any of our government contracts could result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that contract,\nwhich could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, government entities with which we contract are often able to modify, curtail or terminate contracts with us without prior notice at their convenience, and are only liable for payment for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Modification, curtailment or termination of significant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, government contracts are frequently awarded only after competitive bidding processes, which are often protracted. In many cases, unsuccessful bidders for government contracts are provided the opportunity to formally protest certain contract awards through various agencies or other administrative and judicial channels. The protest process may substantially delay a successful bidder's contract performance, result in cancellation of the contract award entirely and distract management. As a result, we may not be awarded contracts for which we bid, and substantial delays or cancellation of contracts may follow any successful bids as a result of such protests, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may never initiate or complete construction of the GE Plants. If we commence construction of either GE Plant, we may encounter difficulties building them and we would need to comply with significant obligations to GE.\nOur ability to commence development and construction of the GE Plants, to be financed under our credit agreement with GE, will depend on our satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the availability of sites upon which to construct the GE Plants, our ability to acquire title to, or leasehold interests in, such sites and the receipt of all governmental approvals necessary to design, develop, own, construct, install, operate and maintain the GE Plants. If we do not satisfy all of the conditions by December 31, 2016, GE's obligation to fund the GE Plants will terminate.\nIf we commence construction of either GE Plant, we may not be able to comply with all of our obligations to GE under the applicable credit agreement. For example, we may not complete one or both of the GE Plants within the required time period, or we may not make our required equity contributions to the GE Plants, which consist of all funding required to complete the plants in excess of the $200 million to potentially be loaned to us by GE. The GE Plants may cost more than we expect, and we may not be able to pay any additional costs. If the GE Plants are completed, they may not generate enough cash flow to pay our obligations to GE because they may experience operational difficulties or inefficiencies or we may not be able to sell enough of the LNG the GE Plants produce. If we construct the GE Plants and we do not fulfill our obligations to GE, we would lose some or all of our investments in the GE Plants.\nOur ability to obtain LNG is constrained by fragmented and limited production and increasing competition for LNG supply.\nProduction of LNG in the United States is fragmented and limited. It may be difficult for us to obtain LNG without interruption and near our current or target markets at competitive prices, when needed, or at all. If LNG liquefaction plants we own, or if any from which we purchase LNG, are damaged by severe weather, earthquakes or other natural disasters or otherwise experience prolonged down time, if any such plants cannot produce LNG meeting applicable composition specifications and requirements, or if we or others do not build additional LNG liquefaction plants, our LNG supply will be restricted. If we are unable to supply enough LNG that satisfies applicable specifications (either from our own plants or by purchasing it from third parties) to meet customer demand, we may lose customers and/or be liable to our customers for penalties and damages. Competition for LNG supply is escalating. For example, we increasingly compete to purchase LNG with other companies that use LNG to fuel equipment deployed in oil and gas production activities. In addition, we expect that the execution of our business plan will require substantial growth in the available LNG supply across the United States, and if this supply is unavailable, it would constrain our ability to serve the market we anticipate for LNG fuel, including the heavy-duty truck market, and would adversely affect our\ninvestments in America's Natural Gas Highway. If we experience an LNG supply interruption or LNG demand that exceeds available supply, or if we have difficulty entering or maintaining relationships with contract carriers to deliver LNG on our behalf, our ability to expand LNG sales to new customers will be limited and our relationships with existing customers may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, because transportation of LNG is relatively expensive, if we are required to supply LNG from distant locations and cannot pass these costs through to our customers, our operating margins will decrease due to our increased transportation costs.\nLNG supply purchase commitments may exceed demand, causing our costs to increase.\nWe are a party to one long-term LNG supply agreement that has a take-or-pay commitment, and we may enter into additional contracts with take-or-pay commitments in the future. Take-or-pay commitments require us to pay for the LNG that we have agreed to purchase irrespective of whether we can sell the LNG. Should the market demand for LNG decline or fail to develop as we anticipate, if we lose significant LNG customers, if demand under any existing or any future LNG sales contract does not maintain its volume levels or grow, or if future demand for LNG otherwise does not meet our expectations, these commitments may cause our operating and supply costs to increase without a corresponding increase in revenue and our margins may be negatively impacted.\nCompliance with potential greenhouse gas regulations affecting our LNG plants or fueling stations may prove costly and negatively affect our financial performance.\nCalifornia has adopted legislation, AB 32, which calls for a cap on greenhouse gas emissions throughout California and a statewide reduction to 1990 levels by 2020 and an additional 80% reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. Other states and the federal government are considering passing similar measures to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Any of these regulations, when and if implemented, may regulate the greenhouse gas emissions produced by our LNG production plants, our CNG and LNG fueling stations or our RNG production facilities and require that we obtain emissions credits or invest in costly emissions prevention technology. We cannot currently estimate the potential costs associated with compliance with federal, state or local regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and these unknown costs are not contemplated by our current customer agreements. If any of these regulations are implemented, our associated compliance costs may have a negative impact on our financial performance, reduce our margins and impair our ability to fulfill customer contracts.\nOur operations entail inherent safety and environmental risks that may result in substantial liability to us.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas, fires, explosions and other damages. For example, operation of LNG pumps requires special training because of the extreme low temperatures of LNG. LNG tanker trailers have also in the past been, and may in the future be, involved in accidents that result in explosions, fires and other damage. Further, improper refueling of natural gas vehicles can result in venting of methane gas, which is a potent greenhouse gas, and such methane emissions may in the future be regulated by the EPA or by state regulatory agencies. Additionally, CNG fuel tanks and trailers, if damaged by accidents or improperly maintained or installed, may rupture and the contents of the tank or trailer may rapidly decompress and result in death or serious injury. These risks may expose us to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. We may incur substantial liability and cost if damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits.\nWe provide financing to fleet customers for natural gas vehicles, which exposes our business to credit risks.\nWe lend to certain qualifying customers a portion of, and occasionally up to 100% of, the purchase price of natural gas vehicles. We may also lease vehicles to customers. There are risks associated with\nproviding financing including the following, among others: (i) the equipment financed consists mostly of vehicles that are mobile and easily damaged, lost or stolen, (ii) the borrower may default on payments, enter bankruptcy proceedings and/or liquidate, (iii) we may not be able to bill properly or track payments in an adequate fashion to properly manage this service, and (iv) the amount of capital available to us is limited and may not allow us to make loans required by customers. As of December 31, 2014, we had $8.3 million outstanding in loans provided to customers to finance natural gas vehicle purchases.\nOur business is subject to a variety of governmental regulations that may restrict our operations and may result in costs and penalties.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to foreign business practices, the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, land use and taxation, among others. It is difficult and costly to manage the requirements of every individual authority having jurisdiction over our various activities and to comply with these varying standards. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Any changes to existing regulations or adoption of new regulations may result in significant additional expense to us and our customers. Further, from time to time, as part of the regular overall evaluation of our operations, including newly acquired or developing operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities, which may involve significant costs and use of other resources. Also, in connection with our operations, we often need facility permits or licenses to address, among other things, storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, and air emissions, which may subject us to onerous or costly permitting conditions. Compliance with these laws and regulations and enforcement policies of regulatory agencies could require us to make material expenditures and may distract our officers, directors and employees.\nOur failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties and the imposition of corrective requirements. In addition, any failure to comply with regulations related to the government procurement process at the federal, state or local level or restrictions on political activities and lobbying may result in administrative or financial penalties, including being barred from providing services to governmental entities.\nOur RNG business may not be successful.\nWe own RNG production facilities located in Canton, Michigan and North Shelby, Tennessee. We are also seeking to increase our RNG business by pursuing additional projects on our own and with project partners. We may not be successful in operating or developing these projects or any future projects or generating a financial return from our investments. Historically, projects that produce pipeline quality RNG have often failed due to the volatile prices of conventional natural gas, unpredictable RNG production levels, technological difficulties and costs associated with operating the production facilities, and the absence of government programs and regulations that support such activities. The success of our RNG business depends on our ability to obtain necessary financing, to successfully manage the construction and operation of RNG production facilities and to either sell RNG at substantial premiums to prices for conventional natural gas prices or to sell, at favorable prices, credits we may generate under federal or state laws, rules and regulations, including RINs and LCFS Credits. If we are not successful at one or more of these activities, our RNG business could fail and our operations and financial results may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for RINs and LCFS Credits is volatile, and the prices for such credits may be subject to significant fluctuations. Further, the value of RINs and LCFS Credits will be adversely affected by any changes to the state and federal programs under which such credits are generated and sold. In the absence of state and federal programs that support premium prices for RNG or that allow us to\ngenerate and sell LCFS Credits and RINs or other credits, or if our customers are not otherwise willing to pay a premium for RNG, we may be unable to profitably operate our RNG business.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties producing RNG.\nWe have experienced difficulty producing the expected volumes of RNG at our operational RNG plants due to, among other factors, problems with key equipment, severe weather, landfill conditions and construction delays. These difficulties may continue or worsen in the future, and our ability to produce RNG may be adversely affected by a number of other factors beyond our control, including, among others, limited availability or unfavorable composition of collected landfill gas, failure to obtain and renew necessary permits, landfill mismanagement, problems with our critical equipment, and adverse or severe weather conditions. In addition, we may seek to or be required to upgrade, expand or service our RNG facilities, which may result in plant shutdowns, cause delays that reduce the amount of RNG we produce or involve significant unexpected costs. Our financial results and operations will be negatively impacted if any of these factors limit our ability to produce sufficient quantities of RNG.\nIf our subsidiary, Canton Renewables, LLC (\"Canton\"), does not comply with its financing agreements, we may lose our interest in our Canton, Michigan RNG production facility.\nOur subsidiary Canton, which directly owns our RNG production facility located in Canton, Michigan, has issued secured debt to third parties. If Canton does not comply with its obligations and covenants under this debt instrument (including its obligations to pay principal and interest), we may lose our interest in Canton's RNG production project.\nWe may from time to time pursue acquisitions, investments or other strategic relationships, which could fail to meet expectations.\nWe may acquire or invest in other companies or businesses. For example, in October 2014, we invested in and purchased a CNG station from NG Advantage. In addition, we may pursue other strategic transactions or relationships. For instance, in September 2014, we formed MCEP. Acquisitions, investments and other strategic partnerships and relationships involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including, among others, the following: difficulties integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company or partner; difficulties in supporting and transitioning vendors, if any, of an acquired company or partner; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment opportunities; failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction or relationship; failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of a company or technology we may acquire, invest in or partner with, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues; risks of entering new markets in which we may have limited or no experience; potential loss of key employees, customers and vendors from either our current business or an acquired company's or partner's business; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition, investment or other related costs; additional costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition, investment or other relationship; and possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to the businesses we partner with, invest in or acquire. The occurrence of any of these risks would cause our business, financial condition and operating results to suffer.\nOur quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and have fluctuated significantly.\nOur quarterly results of operations have historically experienced significant fluctuations. Our net losses were approximately $31.9 million, $11.3 million, $16.3 million, $41.7 million, $3.9 million, $11.9 million, $18.8 million, $32.3 million, $28.6 million, $32.3 million, and $30.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012, September 30, 2012, December 31, 2012, March 31,\n2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014, September 30, 2014, respectively. In the three months ended December 31, 2014, our net income was $1.3 million. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including those described in these risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. As a result of the significant variances in our operating results in prior periods, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and investors in our common stock should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance.\nSales of shares could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were 90,203,344 shares of our common stock outstanding, 11,486,301 shares underlying outstanding options, 2,591,752 shares underlying restricted stock units, 2,130,682 shares underlying outstanding Series I warrants (all of which were sold in November 2008), 5,000,000 shares underlying a warrant we issued in November 2012 to GE, 19,160,338 shares underlying our Series 2011 Notes and 16,025,641 shares underlying our Series 2013 Notes. All of our outstanding shares are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain cases to the requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Also, shares subject to outstanding options, warrants and convertible notes are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of the applicable option, warrant and convertible note agreements and Rule 144, or if such shares have been registered for resale under the Securities Act. If these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAs of December 31, 2014, 18,139,720 shares of our common stock held by our co-founder and board member T. Boone Pickens were pledged as security for loans made to Mr. Pickens. We are not a party to these loans. If the price of our common stock declines, Mr. Pickens may be forced to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of our common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of the loans. Any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common stock to decline further. In addition, a number of our directors and officers have in the past entered into Rule 10b5-1 sales plans with a broker to sell shares of our common stock that they hold or that they may acquire upon the exercise of stock options. Sales under these plans occur automatically without further action by the director or officer once the price, date or other parameters of the particular selling plan are achieved. As of December 31, 2014, no shares were subject to future sales by our directors and officers under these selling plans. If our directors and officers adopt new selling plans and sales of shares under these selling plans occur, the trading price of our common stock could fall.\nA significant portion of our stock is beneficially owned by a single stockholder whose interests may differ from yours and who is able to exert significant influence over our corporate decisions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, T. Boone Pickens beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 24.2% of our common stock (including 18,139,720 shares of common stock, 705,000 shares underlying stock options exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2014, and 4,113,923 shares underlying convertible promissory notes he holds). As a result, Mr. Pickens is able to strongly influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. Mr. Pickens may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for\ntheir stock as part of a sale of our Company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. Conversely, this concentration may facilitate a change of control at a time when you and other investors may prefer not to sell.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. Such volatility may be in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other factors discussed in these risk factors, factors that may cause volatility in our stock price include, among others:\n\u2022 Changes in prices for oil, traditional vehicle fuels such as gasoline and diesel, and natural gas;\n\u2022 Adoption of and growth of the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel;\n\u2022 Our ability to fuel a substantial number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks and other natural gas vehicles;\n\u2022 Adoption by the U.S. heavy-duty truck market of engines that operate on natural gas;\n\u2022 Successful implementation of our business plans, including, without limitation, our ANGH initiative;\n\u2022 Production and supply of LNG and RNG;\n\u2022 Investor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u2022 Fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022 Sales of our common stock by us, our officers or directors, or significant stockholders;\n\u2022 A decline in the trading volume of or the price for our common stock;\n\u2022 Oil and gas companies, natural gas utilities and others entering the market for natural gas fuel;\n\u2022 Changes in our key personnel;\n\u2022 Competitive developments; and\n\u2022 Changes in general economic and market conditions.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and in such instances, have affected the market prices of these companies' securities. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92035, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "CLNE"}
