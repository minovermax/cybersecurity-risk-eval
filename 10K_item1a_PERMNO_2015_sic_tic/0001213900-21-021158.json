{"cik": "879911", "company": "APPLIED ENERGETICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFuture results of operations of Applied Energetics involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect future operating results and cash flows and cause actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not limited to those risks set forth below:\nRisk Related to Our Company\t\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nIn their report accompanying our financial statements, our independent registered public accounting firm stated that our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern, and that they have substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors have noted that our recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations and the concern that we may incur additional losses due to the reduction in government contract activity raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur business has generated little or no revenues during the past two fiscal years and had a net operating loss during each period.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had revenues of $-0- and $175,920, and we had net losses of $5,563,339 and $3,230,494, respectively. We can give no assurances that our planned operations will generate revenues in the future or whether any such revenues will result in profitability.\nWe may need additional financing to fund our operations going forward. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we may need to modify or curtail our development plans and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $3,323,290 of available cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $1,566,365 and in January and February of 2021, we raised an additional $2,258,000. Our cash position is sufficient for the next several months, but we may need to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations beyond that. We must allocate funds toward SEC compliance as well as ITAR and other federal regulatory compliance. We also need funds for our general and administrative expenses include salaries, accounting fees, other professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses. Our failure to secure sufficient financing could render us unable to pay accounting and other fees required to continue to fulfill our SEC reporting obligations. Also, we have incurred a five-year lease obligation for our new facility and will have moving, computer networking and other expenses related thereto. We also may require additional funding for research and development before we are able to commercialize our technology. During the fiscal year, we achieved our capital raising goal, and a portion of the funds for research and development may come from government contracts or sub-contracts with larger contractors. However, we may need to raise additional funds to supplement these contracts even if we are able to secure them.\nOur operating plans and capital requirements are subject to change based on how we determine to proceed with respect to development programs and if we pursue any strategic alternatives. Additional funds may be raised through the issuance of equity securities, but such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all. Any equity financing would cause the percentage ownership by our current stockholders to be diluted, which dilution may be substantial. Also, any additional equity securities issued may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If such financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to modify or curtail our operations, which could cause investors to lose the entire amount of their investment.\nThe ongoing global pandemic has caused unpredictability in capital markets. If this uncertainty continues, it could make it more difficult for companies, including ours, to access capital. It is currently difficult to estimate with any certainty how long the pandemic and resulting curtailment of business will continue, and its effect on capital markets and our ability to raise funds in the future is, accordingly, difficult to quantify.\nRisk Related to Our Business Activities\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to sustain the value of such assets.\nProtecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our ability to maintain the value of our intellectual property. We hold a number of United States patents and patent applications, as well as trademarks, and registrations which are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of our competitive position in the market. We can offer no assurance that any of these patents or future patent applications and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. In some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. In the future, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. While we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and entered into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third-party development of similar technologies. Based on our current financial condition, we may not have the funds available to enforce and protect our intellectual properties.\nWe may face claims of infringement of proprietary rights.\nThere is a risk that a third party may claim our products and technologies infringe on their proprietary rights. Whether or not our products infringe on proprietary rights of third parties, infringement or invalidity claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us, and we could incur significant expense in defending them. If any claims or actions are asserted against us, we may not have the funds necessary to defend against such claims. Our failure to do so could adversely affect the value of our intellectual property.\nManagement has broad discretion over the selection of our prospective business and business opportunities\nAny person who invests in our securities will do so without an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of our prospective business and business opportunities. As a result, investors will be entirely dependent on the broad discretion and judgment of management in connection with the selection of a prospective business. The business decisions made by our management may not be successful.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business.\nDue to the specialized nature of our businesses, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering and scientific personnel. To the extent we obtain Government contracts or significant commercial contracts our prospects depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified engineering, scientific and manufacturing personnel for our operations. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. Our failure to compete for these personnel could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, since the majority of our business involves technologies that are classified due to national security reasons, we must hire U.S. Citizens who have the ability to obtain a security clearance. This further reduces our potential labor pool.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop and commercialize technologies and applications that address the needs of our markets.\nBoth our defense and commercial markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf identify emerging technological trends in our target markets;\n\u25cf develop and maintain competitive products;\n\u25cf enhance our products by improving performance and adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors;\n\u25cf develop and manufacture and bring products to market quickly at cost-effective prices;\n\u25cf obtain commercial scale production orders from our government and other customers;\n\u25cf meet scheduled timetables and enter into suitable arrangements for the development, certification and delivery of new products;\n\u25cf enter into suitable arrangements for volume production of mature products.\nWe believe that, in order to be competitive in the future, we will need to continue to develop and commercialize technologies and products, which will require the investment of financial and engineering resources. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing development and introduction on a commercial scale of new products. Any delays could result in increased costs of development, deflect resources from other projects or incur loss of contracts.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that the market for our technologies and products will develop or continue to expand as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technology to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce any ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing or differing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of our products. The possibility that our competitors might develop new technology or products might cause our existing technology and products to become obsolete or create significant price competition. If we fail in our new product development and commercialization efforts or our products fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, our revenue will decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected.\nWe heavily depend on key personnel, for the successful execution of our business plan. The loss of one or more key members of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\nWe are highly dependent upon Gregory J. Quarles, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen McCahon, our Chief Scientist. We depend on Drs. Quarles\u2019s and McCahon\u2019s decades of expertise for the development of our technology. We also depend upon their global visibility and outreach as well as our directors\u2019 networks of contacts and experience to recruit key talent to the Company. We do not have key-man insurance on any of these individuals. Loss of the services of these key members of our management team, or of our Board of Directors\u2019 ability to identify and hire key talent, could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business prospects may suffer.\nOur success and achievement of our business plans depend upon our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain additional highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Competition for qualified employees among high technology companies is intense, and any inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the implementation of our business plans and activities could strongly impact our business. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel and scientific, regulatory and other consultants and advisors could materially damage our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for our technology has a limited number of potential customers.\nGiven the highly specialized nature of our technology, the potential market for our products is limited to a relative few potential customers who tend to allocate significant budgeted amounts to selected projects. Currently, we are marketing our technology and focusing our research and development on the defense sector, in which demand is ultimately determined primarily by the US federal defense budget and the needs and priorities of the Department of Defense and its various agencies. The potential customers in this area are defense agencies for direct contacts and major defense contractors for subcontracts. Thus the demand for our products depends on their needs for our technology and selecting us for research and development. Although we intend to diversify into other applications for our technology and markets, we cannot be certain that opportunities in those markets will present themselves when we are ready, or that we will otherwise be able, to do so.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nWe are subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements, coupled with our status as a former shell company, may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, and make it difficult for our stockholders to sell their securities.\nRule 3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a minimum bid price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to a limited number of exceptions which are not available to us. This classification would severely and adversely affect any market liquidity for our common stock.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth:\n\u25cf The basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u25cf That the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nBecause of these regulations and restrictions, broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures and/or may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in any secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may decrease, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our common stock. Our common stock, in all probability, will be subject to such penny stock rules and other restrictions for the foreseeable future and our stockholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their shares of common stock.\nBecause we are a former shell company, our stockholders face restrictions on their reliance on Rule 144 to sell their shares.\nHistorically, the SEC staff has taken the position that Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, blank check companies, like us. The SEC has codified and expanded this position in the amendments discussed above by prohibiting the use of Rule 144 for resale of securities issued by any shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company. The SEC has provided an important exception to this prohibition, however, if the following conditions are met:\n\u25cf The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;\n\u25cf The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934;\n\u25cf The issuer of the securities has filed all applicable reports and material required to be filed, as Exchange Act of 1934, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and\n\u25cf At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.\nWe expect that we will be able to meet all of these requirements in the future, but unknown future events and circumstances could change that outcome. As a result, pursuant to Rule 144, stockholders who receive our restricted securities in a private placement or a business combination may not be able to sell our shares without registration for up to one year after we have completed the private placement or business combination.\nA large number of shares of our common stock could be sold in the market in the near future, which could depress our stock price.\nAs of April 8, 2021, we had outstanding approximately 199,375,000 shares of common stock. Approximately 100 million of our shares are currently freely trading without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The remaining shares have been held by their holders for over one year and are thus eligible for sale under rule 144(k) under the Securities Act. Sale of these shares into the market could depress our stock price.\nProvisions of our corporate charter documents could delay or prevent change of control.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval, in one or more series and to fix the dividend rights, terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions applicable to each new series of preferred stock. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, serving staggered three-year terms. At least two annual meetings, instead of one, will be required to effect a change in a majority of our Board of Directors. The designation of preferred stock in the future and the classification of our Board of Directors, could make it difficult for third parties to gain control of our company, prevent or substantially delay a change in control, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, the holders of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock have a right to put their shares to the company for an amount equal to the liquidation preference of approximately $340,000 plus unpaid dividends (approximately $261,000 as of December 31, 2020), in the event of a change of control. Such right could hinder our ability to sell our assets or merge with another company.\nThe redemption and dividend provisions of our outstanding preferred stock are onerous due to our current financial condition.\nThe company has redeemed substantially all of its outstanding preferred stock. At December 31, 2020, 13,602 shares were outstanding with a liquidation preference of approximately $340,000 and unpaid dividends of $261,000. As of April 8, 2021, the liquidation preference of our outstanding preferred stock plus unpaid dividends thereon was approximately $610,000. If an event occurs that would require us to redeem the preferred stock, we may not have the required cash to do so.\nIn addition, our annual dividend payment on the preferred stock is approximately $34,000, which will further deplete our cash. We have not paid the dividends commencing with the quarterly dividend due August 1, 2013 and, as a result, the dividend rate has increased to 10% per annum and will remain at that level until such failure no longer continues. These terms may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or complete an acquisition.\nThe global pandemic COVID-19, otherwise referred to as the Coronavirus, is slowing the process of applying for and awarding government contracts and could impair our ability to expand our research and development capacity or raise additional funding if needed.\nThe ongoing global pandemic has caused disruption in certain government contracting processes and procedures and made travel and other necessities for securing such contracts more difficult. In addition, to the extent that any of our personnel or consultants are affected by the virus, this could cause delays or disruption in our research and development program and affect our ability to execute our plan of operations. The pandemic has also caused unpredictability in capital markets. If this uncertainty continues, it could make it more difficult for companies, including ours, to access capital. It is currently difficult to estimate with any certainty how long the pandemic and resulting will continue, and its effect on capital markets and our ability to raise funds in the future is, accordingly, difficult to quantify.\nAny issuance of additional securities in conjunction with a business or financing opportunity which will result in a dilution of present stockholders\u2019 ownership\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 500,000,000 shares of common stock. As of March 26, 2021, we have approximately 198,875,000 shares issued and outstanding. If funding opportunities present themselves on favorable terms, we may issue additional shares to fund our business or in connection with our pursuit of new business opportunities and new business operations. To the extent that additional shares of common stock are issued, our stockholders would experience dilution of their respective ownership interests. If we issue shares of common stock in connection with our intent to pursue new business opportunities, a change in control of our company could occur. The issuance of additional shares of common stock may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock, particularly given the historically low trading volume in the market for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77443, "SIC": 3600, "TIC": "AERG"}
