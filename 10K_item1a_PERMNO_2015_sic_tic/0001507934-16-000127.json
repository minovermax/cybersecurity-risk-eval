{"cik": "1507934", "company": "Starz", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones facing our company. In the event any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also materially adversely affect us.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nEconomic instability in the U.S. or in other parts of the world could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is affected by prevailing economic conditions. Financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the U.S. could affect our business in an adverse manner. Lower household income and decreases in U.S. consumer discretionary spending, which is sensitive to general economic conditions, may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions, in particular with respect to digital programming packages on which our ENCORE and MOVIEPLEX networks are typically carried and premium video programming packages and premium a la carte on which our STARZ networks are typically carried. A reduction in spending could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers to our networks, which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on Distributors that carry our programming, and no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain and renew our affiliation agreements on favorable terms or at all.\nWe currently distribute our programming through affiliation agreements with many Distributors, including AT&T, Cablevision, Charter, Comcast, Cox, DIRECTV, DISH Network, Time Warner Cable and Verizon. Our affiliation agreements with Distributors are scheduled to expire at various dates through 2020. The largest Distributors have significant leverage in their relationship with certain programmers, including Starz. As of September 30, 2015, the four largest MVPDs provided service to approximately 75% of U.S. multichannel households. Further consolidation among Distributors could increase this leverage.\nIn some cases, if a Distributor is acquired, the affiliation agreement of the acquiring Distributor will govern following the acquisition. In those circumstances, the acquisition of a Distributor that is party to affiliation agreements with us that are more favorable to us would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe renewal negotiation process for affiliation agreements is typically lengthy. In certain cases, renewals are not agreed upon prior to the expiration of a given agreement, while the programming continues to be carried by the relevant Distributor pursuant to the other terms and conditions in the affiliation agreement. We may be unable to obtain renewals with our current Distributors on acceptable terms, if at all. We may also be unable to successfully negotiate affiliation agreements with new or existing Distributors to carry our programming. The failure to successfully renew affiliation agreements on acceptable terms, or the failure to negotiate new affiliation agreements at all, in each case covering a material portion of multichannel television households, could result in a discontinuation of carriage, or could otherwise materially adversely affect our subscriber growth, revenue and earnings which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of Distributors for a significant portion of our revenue.\nOur networks depend upon agreements with a limited number of Distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2015, AT&T (including DIRECTV, which it acquired in July 2015) and Comcast each accounted for at least 10% of Starz\u2019s revenue. The loss of any significant Distributor, or our inability to renew an affiliation agreement with any significant Distributor on acceptable terms, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOccasionally we have disputes with our Distributors over the terms of our carriage, such as how the Distributor markets our services (such as free offers), or other contract terms. If not resolved through business negotiation, such disputes could result in litigation or termination of an existing agreement. Termination of a significant existing agreement resulting in the loss of distribution of our programming to a material portion of our multichannel television households would materially adversely affect our subscriber growth, revenue and earnings and would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing rates paid by Distributors to other programmers may result in increased rates charged to their subscribers for their services, making it more costly for subscribers to purchase our STARZ and ENCORE services.\nThe amounts paid by Distributors to certain programming networks for the rights to carry broadcast networks and sports networks have increased substantially in recent years. As a result, Distributors have passed on some of these increases to their subscribers. The rates that subscribers pay for programming from Distributors continue to increase each year and these increases may impact our ability, as a premium subscription video provider, to increase or even maintain our subscriber levels and may adversely impact our revenue and earnings which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to intense competition for marketing and carriage of our networks, which may have a negative effect on our profitability or on our ability to expand our business.\nThe subscription video programming industry is highly competitive. Our STARZ and ENCORE networks compete with other programming networks and other types of video programming services for marketing and distribution by Distributors. We face intense competition from other providers of programming networks for the right to be carried by a particular Distributor and for the right to be carried by such Distributor on a particular \u201ctier\u201d or in a particular \u201cpackage\u201d of service.\nCertain programming networks affiliated with broadcast networks like ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC or other programming networks affiliated with sports and certain general entertainment networks with strong viewer ratings have a competitive advantage over our networks in obtaining distribution through the \u201cbundling\u201d of carriage agreements for such programming networks with a Distributor\u2019s right to carry the affiliated broadcasting network. The inability of our programming networks to be carried by one or more Distributors, or the inability of our programming networks to be placed on a particular tier or programming package could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our Distributors to market our networks and other services, the lack of which may result in reduced customer demand.\nAt times, certain of our Distributors do not allow us to participate in cooperative marketing campaigns to market our networks and services. Our inability to participate in the marketing of our networks and other services may put us at a competitive disadvantage. Also, our Distributors are often focused more on marketing their bundled service offerings (video, Internet and telephone) than premium video services. If our Distributors do not sign up new subscribers to our networks, we may lose subscribers which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adapt to new content distribution platforms and to changes in consumer behavior resulting from these new technologies.\nWe must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry, including the emergence of alternative distribution platforms. Our ability to exploit new distribution platforms and viewing technologies will affect our ability to maintain or grow our business and may increase our capital expenditures. Additionally, we must adapt to changing consumer behavior driven by advances such as DVRs, video-on-demand, online based content delivery, Blu-ray players, game consoles and mobile devices. Such changes may impact the revenue we are able to generate from our traditional distribution methods by decreasing the viewership of our networks on systems of cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunication companies, or by decreasing the number of households subscribing to services offered by those Distributors. If we fail to adapt our distribution methods and content to emerging technologies, our appeal to our targeted audiences might decline and there would be a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the appeal of our programming to Distributors and subscribers, which is difficult to predict.\nOur business depends in part upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of the programming on our networks. These factors are difficult to predict and subject to influences that are beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment activities. We may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets. A change in viewer preferences could cause our programming to decline in popularity, which could jeopardize renewal of our affiliation agreements with Distributors. In addition, our competitors may have more flexible programming arrangements, as well as greater amounts of available content, distribution and capital resources and may be able to react more quickly than we can to shifts in tastes and interests.\nTo an increasing extent, the success of our business depends on exclusive original programming and our ability to accurately predict how audiences will respond to our original programming. Because original programming often involves a greater degree of financial commitment, as compared to acquired programming that we license from third parties, and because our network branding strategies depend significantly on a relatively small number of original series, a failure to anticipate viewer preferences for such series could be especially detrimental to our business.\nIn addition, theatrical feature films constitute a significant portion of the programming on our STARZ and ENCORE programming networks. In general, the popularity of feature-film content on linear television is declining, due in part to the\nbroad availability of such content through an increasing number of distribution platforms prior to our linear window. Should the popularity of feature-film programming suffer significant further declines, we may lose subscribership or be forced to rely more heavily on original programming, which could increase our costs.\nIf our programming does not gain the level of audience acceptance we expect, or if we are unable to maintain the popularity of our programming, we may have a diminished negotiating position when dealing with Distributors, which could reduce our revenue and earnings. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the success of any of our current programming, or generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new original programming. This would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur networks\u2019 success depends upon the availability of programming that is adequate in quantity and quality, and we may be unable to secure or maintain such programming.\nOur networks\u2019 success depends upon the availability of quality programming, particularly original programming and films, that is suitable for our target markets. While we produce some of our original programming, we obtain most of our programming (including some of our original series, films and other acquired programming) through agreements with third parties that have produced or control the rights to such programming. These agreements expire at varying times and may be terminated by the other party if we are not in compliance with their terms.\nWe compete with other programming networks to secure desired programming. Competition for programming has increased as the number of programming networks has increased. Other programming networks that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area. In addition to other cable programming networks, we also compete for programming with national broadcast television networks, local broadcast television stations, video-on-demand services and online based content delivery services such as Amazon, Hulu, iTunes and Netflix. Some of these competitors have exclusive contracts with motion picture studios or independent motion picture distributors or own film libraries.\nIn December 2012, we made the decision not to extend our licensing agreement with Disney beyond its expiration on December 31, 2015. We will continue to receive qualifying films released theatrically in the U.S. by Disney\u2019s Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disney-Pixar, Touchstone Pictures, Marvel Entertainment and Hollywood Pictures labels through December 31, 2015, with initial license periods for such films extending into 2017. In February 2013, we extended our Sony output licensing agreement for initial theatrical releases in the U.S. through December 31, 2021.\nWe cannot assure you that we will ultimately be successful in negotiating renewals of our programming rights agreements or in negotiating adequate substitute agreements. In the event that these agreements expire or are terminated and are not replaced by programming content, including additional original programming, acceptable to our Distributors and subscribers, it would have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have entered into output licensing agreements that require us to make substantial payments.\nWe have entered into agreements to acquire theatrical releases from Sony and Disney. The Sony agreement will expire on December 31, 2021. The agreement with Disney expired on December 31, 2015, but we will continue to receive films theatrically released by Disney\u2019s studios through that date, with initial license periods for these films extending into 2017. Each agreement requires us to pay for films released by each studio at rates calculated on a pricing grid that is based on each film\u2019s domestic box office performance (subject to maximum amounts payable per film and a cap on the number of films that can be put to us each year), and the amounts payable pursuant to those agreements will be substantial. We believe that the theatrical performance of the films we will receive under the agreements will perform at levels consistent with the performance of films we have received from Sony and Disney in the past. We also assume a certain number of annual releases of first run films by Sony\u2019s studios consistent with the number we received in prior years. Should the films perform at higher levels across the slate of films we receive or the quantity of films increase, then our payment obligations under these agreements would increase and would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in foreign, state and local tax incentives may increase the cost of original programming content to such an extent that they are no longer feasible.\nOriginal programming requires substantial financial commitment. In some cases the financial commitment can be offset by foreign, state or local tax incentives. However, there is a risk that the tax incentives will not remain available for the duration of a series. If tax incentives are no longer available or reduced substantially, it may result in increased costs for us to complete the production or make the production of additional seasons more expensive. If we are unable to produce original\nprogramming content on a cost effective basis our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nAny continued or permanent inability to transmit our programming via satellite would result in lost revenue and could result in lost subscribers.\nOur success is dependent upon our continued ability to transmit our programming to Distributors from our satellite uplink facility, which transmissions are subject to FCC compliance in the U.S. We have entered into long-term satellite transponder leases that expire between 2018 and 2021 in the U.S. for carriage of our networks\u2019 programming. These leases provide for the continued carriage of our programming on available replacement transponders and/or replacement satellites, as applicable, throughout the term of the leases, in the event of a failure of either the transponders and/or satellites currently carrying our programming. Although we believe we take reasonable and customary measures to ensure continued satellite transmission capability, termination or interruption of satellite transmissions may occur and would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite our efforts to secure transponder capacity with long-term satellite transponder leases, there is a risk that when these leases expire, we may not be able to secure capacity on a transponder or may not be able to secure capacity on a transponder on the same or similar terms. This may result in an inability to transmit our content and could result in significant lost revenue and lost subscribers and would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our technology facilities fail or their operations are disrupted, our business could be damaged.\nOur programming is transmitted from our uplink center in Englewood, Colorado. We use this center for a variety of purposes, including signal processing, satellite uplinking, program editing, on-air promotions, creation of programming segments (i.e., interstitials) to fill short gaps between featured programs, quality control and live and recorded playback. Our uplink center is equipped with backup generator power and other redundancies. However, like other facilities, this facility is subject to interruption from fire, lightning, adverse weather conditions and other natural causes. Equipment failure, employee misconduct or outside interference could also disrupt the facility\u2019s services. We have made arrangements at a third party facility to uplink our linear channels and services to our satellites in the event we are unable to do so from this facility. Additionally, we have direct fiber connectivity to certain of our Distributors, which would allow continuous operation with respect to a significant segment of our subscriber base in the event of a satellite transmission interruption. Notwithstanding these precautions, any significant or prolonged interruption at our facility, and any failure by our third party facility to perform as intended, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProtection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.\nWe maintain information in digital form as necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information, copies of films, television programs and other content and personal information regarding our employees. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. In addition, we provide confidential information, digital content and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk that data systems of these third parties may be compromised. If our data systems or data systems of these third parties are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Furthermore, a penetration of our network security or other theft or misuse of confidential and proprietary information, digital content or personal employee information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPiracy of films and television programs is an increasingly prevalent problem and could adversely affect our business over time.\nPiracy is prevalent in many parts of the world and has been made easier in recent years by the availability of digital copies of content and technological advances allowing conversion of films and television programs into digital formats, which\nfacilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of films and television programs. Piracy has long-term implications for our business, as it may eventually force film studios to invest less in films, resulting in the release of fewer films and/or an increase in the use of other channels for releasing films. If piracy of films or television programs were to increase, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our intellectual property rights, including service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights (including our programming and our websites), trade secrets and similar intellectual property, as critical to our success. Our business also relies heavily upon software codes, informational databases and other components that aid in the provision of our networks to our Distributors.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights, particularly our brand, in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of our brand and limit our ability to control marketing of our networks, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel and artistic talent could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of our senior executives. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance. In addition, we depend on the availability of a number of writers, directors, producers and others, who are employees of third-party production companies that create our original programming. The loss of any significant personnel or talent could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nOur content providers\u2019 talent, including writers, directors, actors and production personnel and those working on our original series, may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. In general, a labor dispute involving talent involved in content production at our content providers or working on our original series may disrupt our operations or result in work stoppages. Labor disputes or work stoppages may impair our ability to complete our original series or restrict our access to content, resulting in increased costs and decreased revenue, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is limited by regulatory constraints which may adversely impact our operations.\nAlthough our business generally is not directly regulated by the FCC, under the Communications Act of 1934 and the 1992 Cable Act, there are certain FCC regulations that govern our business either directly or indirectly. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Starz Networks - Regulatory Matters.\u201d Furthermore, to the extent that regulations and laws, either presently in force or proposed, hinder or stimulate the growth of the cable television and satellite industries, our business will be affected.\nRegulations governing our businesses are subject to the political process and have been in constant flux historically. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated. We cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate material changes in laws or regulatory requirements or that future legislation, new regulation or deregulation will not have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur license agreement with Weinstein requires us to pay a master advance.\nWe pay a master advance to Weinstein for a portfolio of films that we distribute for Weinstein in the home entertainment ancillary revenue markets. The master advance is non-refundable and is earned back or recouped from the profits earned from the distribution of the overall portfolio of films. The total master advance could exceed the portfolio\u2019s\ntotal profits, which would require us to record such excess as a loss in our consolidated statement of operations. Such loss could be significant and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Starz Distribution operating segment depends on the quantity and box office success of Weinstein titles, which are difficult to predict.\nThe financial performance of our Anchor Bay Entertainment and Starz Digital businesses significantly depends on the number of titles provided by Weinstein, as well as the U.S. box office success of Weinstein titles. If we are not provided with a sufficient number of Weinstein titles, if Weinstein titles do not gain the appropriate level of U.S. box office success, or if they have limited commercial appeal in the home entertainment ancillary market, we may be unable to garner advantageous placement for our DVDs and other media, at retail and online, and revenue for our Starz Distribution operating segment could be significantly impacted which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Starz Distribution operating segment is subject to intense competition, which may have a materially adverse effect on our profitability or on our ability to expand our business.\nThe home entertainment industry is highly competitive. We compete to sell DVDs and other media (e.g., digital and television programs) with all of the major Hollywood studios, including Disney, Paramount, Sony, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal and Warner Bros. as well as smaller studios such as Lionsgate. All of these studios distribute their theatrical, television and titles acquired from third parties on DVD and other media and have marketing budgets that are well in excess of the amounts we are able to spend to market our content. We also compete with independent home entertainment distributors that are not affiliated with a Hollywood studio such as Alchemy, Cinedigm Corp., Entertainment One, Gaiam, Magnolia Pictures and RLJ Entertainment.\nIn addition to competing with these parties for ultimate consumer sales of DVDs and other media, we also compete with them for \u201cplacement\u201d at retailers and other distributors. Placement refers to the location in a store or on a website where our content is placed for sale as well as the actual amount of physical shelf space allotted to a release. The better the location and the more space we are allotted the greater the chance our content will be seen by the consumer and ultimately purchased. The quality and quantity of titles as well as the quality of our marketing programs determines how much shelf space we are able to garner at any given time as retailers and other distributors look to maximize sales.\nWe compete with Hollywood studios and other distributors that may have certain competitive advantages over us to acquire the rights to sell or rent DVDs and other media. Our ability to license and produce quality content in sufficient quantities has a direct impact on our ability to acquire shelf space at retail locations and on websites. Some of our competitors, including the Hollywood studios, are large publicly held companies that have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, most of our content is obtained through agreements with other parties that have produced or own the rights to such content, while Hollywood studios produce most of the content they distribute.\nOur DVD sales and other media sales are also impacted by myriad choices consumers have to view entertainment content, including over-the-air broadcast television, cable television networks, online services, mobile services, radio, print media, motion picture theaters and other sources of information and entertainment. The increasing availability of content from these varying media outlets may reduce our ability to sell DVDs and other media in the future, particularly during difficult economic conditions.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations.\nWe distribute programming and produce certain of our original series in a number of foreign jurisdictions. The inherent economic risks of doing business in international markets include, among other things, changes in the economic environment, exchange controls, tariffs and other trade barriers, foreign taxation, restrictions on content, differing degrees of protection for intellectual property, corruption and, in some markets, increased risk of political instability. Additionally, the local currencies in which our international operations conduct their business could change in value relative to the U.S. dollar, exposing our results to exchange rate fluctuations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, we had total debt of $1,037.8 million, consisting of $676.9 million of 5% senior notes due September 15, 2019 (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d), $308.0 million of borrowings under the 2015 credit agreement (\u201c2015 Credit Agreement\u201d) which matures on April 20, 2020, $64.8 million of capital lease obligations less $11.9 million of debt issuance costs. We also have an additional $692.0 million available for borrowing under our 2015 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2015. We may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility in responding to current market conditions, and could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, preventing us from meeting our obligations under our debt instruments or otherwise restricting our business activities.\nThe existence of and limitations on the availability of our debt could have important consequences. The existence of debt could, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of our net cash provided by operating activities to be dedicated to the payment of principal on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use net cash provided by operating activities or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, which reduces the funds available to us for operations and any future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our 2015 Credit Agreement, are at variable interest rates;\n\u2022\ncause our content providers and Distributors to attempt to use our significant debt levels in order to put pricing pressure on us during negotiations of affiliation and output licensing agreements; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions.\nLimitations imposed as a part of our debt, such as the availability of credit and the existence of restrictive covenants may, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the Senior Notes and our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, other business opportunities or other general business purposes on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient net cash provided by operating activities to service our debt obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of net cash provided by operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness, including our Senior Notes and 2015 Credit Agreement.\nIf our net cash provided by operating activities and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in original programming and capital expenditures, or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Additionally, we may not be able to consummate asset dispositions or obtain the proceeds that we expect to realize from them, and any proceeds received may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. The terms of the indenture governing our Senior Notes, the 2015 Credit Agreement and future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nCovenants in our debt agreements will restrict our business in many ways.\nOur 2015 Credit Agreement and Senior Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on property or assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans or investments;\n\u2022\nsell or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\npay certain dividends and other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ndissolve, consolidate or merge;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nrestrict subsidiary distributions.\nOur 2015 Credit Agreement and Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants and our 2015 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our 2015 Credit Agreement, which in turn could result in a default under the indenture governing our Senior Notes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our 2015 Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our 2015 Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged the membership interest of Starz, LLC and the equity interests of our material restricted subsidiaries as collateral under our 2015 Credit Agreement. If the lenders and counterparties under our 2015 Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of obligations, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our 2015 Credit Agreement and our other indebtedness.\nBorrowings under our 2015 Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, we may not be able to successfully hedge the impact of these increased interest rates and our debt service obligations under the 2015 Credit Agreement would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash on hand would decrease.", "PERMNO": 91276, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "STRZA"}
