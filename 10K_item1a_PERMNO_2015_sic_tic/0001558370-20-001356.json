Risk Factors\nOur business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. If any of the following risks occur, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue and future prospects could be seriously harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements in the following risk factors section, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to adequately measure and limit our credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nThe business of lending is inherently risky, including risks that the principal of or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower\u2019s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio. Failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could lead to unexpected losses and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our net interest income and on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many factors outside our control impact interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and macroeconomic conditions. A majority of our banking assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings are significantly dependent on our net interest income and are subject to \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities that may negatively impact our earnings. Interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default and delayed payment, and reduces demand for collateral securing the loan. Further, loans in nonaccrual status require continued funding costs, but result in decreased interest income. Interest rate increases may also reduce the demand for loans and increase competition for deposits. Declining interest rates can increase loan prepayments and long-term fixed rate credits, which could adversely impact our earnings and net interest margin if rates increase. If short-term interest rates remain at low levels for a prolonged period and longer-term interest rates fall, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest-earning assets would continue to reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Changes in interest rates can also impact the value of loans, securities and other assets.\nOur business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of our markets and on the banking industry in general.\nOur business is concentrated in the Houston and Beaumont, Texas markets and we recently entered the Dallas, Texas market. Our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the economic activity and conditions in our markets. Economic conditions within our markets are influenced by the energy sector generally and the price of oil and gas in\nparticular. Adverse economic conditions that impact our markets could reduce our growth rate, the ability of our customers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our loans, our ability to attract deposits and generally impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Due to our geographic concentration, we may be less able than other larger regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks.\nNational market conditions and economic trends, such as volatility in the real estate market in some parts of the country, uncertain regulatory and changing interest rate conditions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. A national economic downturn or deterioration of conditions in our market could adversely impact our borrowers and cause losses beyond those that are provided for in our allowance for credit losses due to increases in loan delinquencies, nonperforming assets and foreclosures and decreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely impact our liquidity position and decrease the value of the collateral.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management\u2019s judgment of probable losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is inherently highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of and assumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Inaccurate management assumptions, deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification or deterioration of additional problem loans, acquisition of problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses.\nIn addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their periodic examinations, review our methodology for calculating and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and may direct us to make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, we may need additional provisions for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.\nFinally, the measure of our allowance for loan losses is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of accounting standards. The adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on January 1, 2020 will impact our methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses. See \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1.\u201d\nThe amount of nonperforming and classified assets may increase significantly, resulting in additional losses and costs and expenses.\nOur nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and assets acquired through foreclosure. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management\u2019s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations when they become due. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management, which may materially and adversely impact their ability to perform their other responsibilities. While we seek to reduce problem assets through loan workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition and any increase in the amount of nonperforming or classified assets could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including through increased capital requirements from regulators.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to endure adverse business developments, which may impair our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of a small group of people and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If our borrowers are unable to repay their loans, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely impacted by sustained low oil prices, volatility in oil prices and downturns in the energy industry.\nThe economy in Texas is dependent on the energy industry. Sustained low oil prices or the failure of oil prices to rise in the future and the resulting downturns or lack of growth in the energy industry and energy-related business, could have a negative impact on the Texas economy and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Prolonged or heightened pricing pressure on oil and gas could lead to increased credit stress in our energy portfolio, increased losses associated with that portfolio and weaker demand for energy lending. More significantly for us, sustained low oil prices or general uncertainty resulting from energy price volatility could have other adverse impacts such as job losses in industries tied to energy, lower spending habits, lower borrowing needs and a number of other potential impacts that are difficult to isolate or quantify.\nWe are subject to risk arising from conditions impacting the real estate market and related appraisals and other valuation techniques to evaluate and monitor these loans.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $2.0 billion, or 75.0%, of our gross loans were loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. Real estate values in many Texas markets have experienced periods of fluctuation and can fluctuate significantly in a short period. Adverse developments affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in our markets or in Texas generally, could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, result in losses that adversely affect credit quality and cause us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. In addition, adverse weather events, including hurricanes and flooding, could damage the property pledged as collateral, which could also result in additional losses upon foreclosure. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Any declines in real estate values that are used as collateral for loans, decreased liquidity and increased losses on foreclosure could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time of appraisal and real estate values may change significantly in relatively short periods of time. These estimates may not accurately describe the value of the real property collateral and we may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness when we foreclose on and sell the relevant property.\nWe are subject to risk from foreclosure of real estate assets.\nIf we foreclose on a loan with real estate assets as collateral, we would own the underlying real estate, subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership. The amount that we may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to general or local economic conditions, environmental cleanup liability, assessments, real estate tax rates, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties, zoning laws, governmental and regulatory rules and natural disasters.\nAdditionally, consumer protection initiatives or changes in state or federal law may substantially increase the time and expense associated with the foreclosure process or prevent us from foreclosing at all. While historically Texas has had foreclosure laws that are favorable to lenders, a number of states in recent years have either considered or adopted foreclosure reform laws that make it substantially more difficult and expensive for lenders to foreclose on properties in default and we cannot be certain that Texas will not adopt similar legislation in the future. Additionally, federal regulators have prosecuted a number of mortgage servicing companies for alleged consumer law violations.\nCommercial real estate and real estate construction and development loan portfolio have credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $1.2 billion, or 44.5%, of our gross loans were nonresidential real estate loans (including owner-occupied commercial real estate loans) and $527.8 million, or 19.9%, of our total loans were construction and development loans. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions.\nOwner-occupied commercial real estate is generally less dependent upon income generated directly from the property but still carries risks from the successful operation of the underlying business or adverse economic conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate due to the fluctuation of real estate values. Additionally, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses.\nConstruction and development loans also involve risks because loan funds are secured by a project under construction and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. It can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and construction and development lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may be unable to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project, incur taxes, maintenance and compliance costs for a foreclosed property and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period.\nWe could be adversely impacted by loans collateralized by general business assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, commercial and industrial loans were $527.6 million, or 19.9%, of our gross loans. Commercial and industrial loans are generally collateralized by general business assets, including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and most are backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Commercial and industrial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis and repayment is subject to the ongoing business operations risks of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, thus exposing us to increased credit risk.\nDelinquencies, defaults and foreclosures in residential mortgages create a higher risk of repurchases and indemnity requests.\nWe originate residential mortgage loans for sale to correspondent banks who may resell such mortgages to government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors. As a part of this process, we make various representations and warranties to the purchasers that are tied to the underwriting standards under which the investors agreed to purchase the loan. If a representation or warranty proves to be untrue, we could be required to repurchase one or more of the mortgage loans or indemnify the investor. Repurchase and indemnity obligations tend to increase during weak economic times, as investors seek to pass on the risks associated with mortgage loan delinquencies to the originator of the mortgage. Although we did not repurchase any residential mortgage loans sold to correspondent banks in 2018 or 2019, if we are forced to repurchase mortgage loans in the future that we have previously sold to investors, or indemnify those investors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur largest loan and deposit relationships currently make up significant percentages of our total loan portfolio and of our deposits, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 15 largest loan relationships, including related entities, totaled $334.4 million, or 12.6%, of the total loan portfolio. The concentration risk associated with having a small number of large loan relationships is that, if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, we could be at serious risk of material losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships and any loss or increase in the allowance would negatively impact our earnings and capital. Even if the loans are collateralized, a large increase in classified assets could harm our reputation with our regulators and inhibit our ability to execute our business plan.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our 15 largest depositors, including related entities, totaled $394.2 million, or 13.8%, of our total deposits. Several of our large depositors have business, family, or other relationships with each other, which creates a risk that any one customer\u2019s withdrawal of their deposits could lead to a loss of other deposits from customers within the relationship. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors or by one of our related customer groups could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, which may be more expensive and less stable.\nWe have made loans to and accepted deposits from related parties.\nFrom time to time, we have made loans to and accepted deposits from certain of our directors and officers and the directors and officers of the Bank in compliance with applicable regulations and our written policies. Our business relationships with related parties are highly regulated. In particular, our ability to do business with related parties is limited with respect to, among other things, extensions of credit described in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation O and covered transactions described in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W. If we were to fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement and other legal actions by the Federal Reserve.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the unexpected loss of the services of our executive management team and other key employees.\nOur success depends in large part on the performance of our executive management team and other key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for qualified employees is intense and the process of locating qualified key personnel may be lengthy and expensive. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees or finding adequate replacements for lost personnel.\nOur growth strategy, which includes acquisitions and de novo branching, includes a number of risks.\nWe intend to pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe complement our activities and have the ability to enhance our profitability and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\ncompetition from other banking organizations and other acquirers;\n\u00b7\nmarket pricing for desirable acquisitions resulting in lower than traditional returns;\n\u00b7\nthe time and expense associated with identifying, evaluating, and negotiating acquisitions, including diversion of management time from the operation of our existing business;\n\u00b7\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments with respect to the health or value of acquisition targets;\n\u00b7\nfailure to achieve expected revenues, earnings, savings or synergies from an acquisition;\n\u00b7\nunknown or contingent target liabilities, including compliance and regulatory issues;\n\u00b7\nthe time and expense required of integration of target customers and data;\n\u00b7\nloss of key employees and customers;\n\u00b7\nreputational issues if the target\u2019s management does not align with our culture and values;\n\u00b7\nrisks of impairment to goodwill; and\n\u00b7\nregulatory delays.\nOur business strategy includes evaluating strategic opportunities to grow through de novo branching which carries with it certain potential risks, including significant startup costs and anticipated initial operating losses; an inability to gain regulatory approval; an inability to secure the services of qualified senior management to operate the de novo banking locations and successfully integrate and promote our corporate culture among various others. Failure to adequately manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth through de novo branching could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting policies we consider to be \u201ccritical\u201d are those significant accounting policies and methods that require judgments, assumptions and estimates and materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. See the section captioned \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If future events or regulatory views differ significantly from our judgments, assumptions and estimates, a restatement of prior period financial statements may\nbe required. Any such restatement may damage our reputation and could adversely impact the price of our common stock, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere could be material changes to our financial statements and disclosures as a result of changes in accounting standards or regulatory interpretations of existing standards.\nFrom time to time the FASB or the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new accounting and reporting standards or change existing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how new or existing standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new standard, a revision to an existing standard or change the application of a standard in such a way that financial statements for periods previously reported are revised.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. In the past, significant deficiencies have been identified in our internal controls over financial reporting. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the Company\u2019s financial reporting. Our actions to maintain effective controls and remedy any weakness or deficiency may not be sufficient to result in an effective internal control environment and any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, impair investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, impair our access to the capital markets, cause the price of our common stock to decline and subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and/or penalties, and higher risk of shareholder litigation.\nWe are dependent on the use of data and modeling in our decision-making.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitative analyses is endemic to bank decision-making and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are all examples of areas in which we are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. The use of statistical and quantitative models is also becoming more prevalent in regulatory compliance. While we are not currently subject to annual Dodd-Frank Act stress testing and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review submissions, we anticipate that model-derived testing may become more extensively implemented by regulators in the future.\nWe anticipate data-based modeling will penetrate further into bank decision-making, particularly risk management efforts, as the capacities developed to meet rigorous stress testing requirements can be employed more widely and in differing applications. While we believe these quantitative techniques and approaches improve our decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could negatively impact our decision-making ability or if we become subject to regulatory stress testing in the future, adverse regulatory scrutiny. Further, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision-making.\nA lack of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and unpredictable circumstances, including events causing industry or general financial market stress. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and securities to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, loan repayments, sales of our securities, sales of loans and other sources could have a negative impact on our liquidity.\nOur most important source of funds is deposits, which have historically been stable sources of funds. However, deposits are subject to potentially dramatic fluctuations in availability or price due to factors that may be outside of our control, including increasing competitive pressure from other financial services firms for consumer or corporate customer deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes. As a result, there could be significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant changes in pricing necessary to maintain current customer deposits or attract additional deposits, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOur access to funding sources, such as through our line of credit, capital markets offerings, borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Federal Home Loan Bank, or from other third-parties, in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nWe have unfunded credit commitments, which could adversely impact our liquidity.\nWe have unfunded commitments to extend credit, which are formal agreements to lend funds to customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in the contracts. Unfunded credit commitments are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and are generally not drawn upon. Borrowing needs of our customers may exceed our expectations, especially during a challenging economic environment where clients are more dependent on our credit commitments. Increased borrowings under these commitments could adversely impact our liquidity.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services.\nWe operate in the highly competitive financial services industry and face significant competition for customers from financial institutions located both within and beyond our principal markets. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, nonbank financial services companies and other financial institutions operating within or near the areas we serve. Additionally, certain large banks headquartered outside of our markets and large community banking institutions target the same customers we do. In addition, as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and mobile devices and for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. The banking industry has experienced rapid changes in technology and, as a result, our future success may depend in part on our ability to address our customers\u2019 needs by using technology. Customer loyalty can be influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Increased lending activity of competing banks can also lead to increased competitive pressures on loan rates and terms for high-quality credits. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our markets and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margins and reduced profitability.\nMany of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our activities and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. The financial services industry could become even more competitive because of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In addition, some of our current commercial banking customers may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than we may be able to accommodate.\nNegative public opinion regarding our company or failure to maintain our reputation in the communities we serve could adversely impact our business.\nAs a community bank, our reputation within the communities we serve is critical to our success. We believe we have set ourselves apart from our competitors by building strong personal and professional relationships with our customers and by being active members of the communities we serve. As such, we strive to enhance our reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve and delivering superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, we may be less successful in attracting new talent and customers or may lose existing customers. Further, negative public opinion can expose us to litigation and regulatory action and could delay and impede our efforts to implement our expansion strategy.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nWe invest in securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, providing an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledging requirements and meeting regulatory capital requirements. Factors beyond our control can significantly and adversely influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio. For example, fixed rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment or in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Although we have not recognized other-than-temporary impairment related to our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019, changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, among other factors, may cause us to recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods.\nWe depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, including third-party service providers.\nOur business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems including with third-party servicers and financial intermediaries. We outsource many of our major systems. Specifically, we rely on third-parties for certain services, including, but not limited to, core systems processing, website hosting, internet services, monitoring our network and other processing services. Our business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions The failure of these systems, an information security or cybersecurity breach involving any of our third-party service providers, or the termination or change in terms of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Replacing vendors or addressing other issues with our third-party service providers could entail significant delay, expense and disruption of service could adversely impact or business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we can replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us.\nIn addition, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, the OCC, has issued guidance outlining the expectations for third-party service provider oversight and monitoring by financial institutions. The federal banking agencies, including the OCC, have issued enforcement actions against financial institutions for failure in oversight of third-party providers and violations of federal banking law by such providers when performing services for financial institutions. Any failure on our part to adequately oversee the actions of our third-party service providers could result in regulatory actions against the Bank.\nWe could be adversely impacted by fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security and cybersecurity attacks.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us, our clients, or third-parties with whom we interact and that may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of confidential information belonging to us or personal or confidential information belonging to our clients, misappropriation of assets, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Our industry has seen increases in electronic fraudulent activity, hacking, security breaches, sophisticated social engineering and cyber-attacks, including within the commercial banking sector, as cyber-criminals have been targeting commercial bank and brokerage accounts on an increasing basis.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third-parties with whom we interact or on whom we rely. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third-parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third-parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. All of these factors increase our risks related to cyber-threats and electronic disruptions.\nIn addition to well-known risks related to fraudulent activity, which take many forms, such as check \u201ckiting\u201d or fraud, wire fraud, and other dishonest acts, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents have become a material risk in the financial services industry. These threats may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to data processing or data storage systems used by us or by our clients, electronic identity theft, \u201cphishing\u201d, account takeover, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. These electronic viruses or malicious code are typically designed to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to us or our clients and customers;\n\u00b7\nmanipulate or destroy data;\n\u00b7\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on a financial institution\u2019s systems; or\n\u00b7\nsteal money.\nIn recent periods, several governmental agencies and large corporations, including financial service organizations and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only their confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients or clients and their employees or other third-parties, and subjecting those agencies and corporations to potential fraudulent activity and their clients and other third-parties to identity theft and fraudulent activity in their credit card and banking accounts. Therefore, security breaches and cyber-attacks can cause significant increases in operating costs, including the costs of compensating clients and customers for any resulting losses they may incur, and the costs and capital expenditures required to correct the deficiencies in and strengthen the security of data processing and storage systems.\nUnfortunately, it is not always possible to anticipate, detect or recognize these threats to our systems, or to implement effective preventative measures against all breaches, whether those breaches are malicious or accidental. Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years and have been difficult to detect before they occur because of the following, among other reasons:\n\u00b7\nthe proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions;\n\u00b7\nthese threats arise from numerous sources, not all of which are in our control, including among others, human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third-parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets, natural disasters or severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts;\n\u00b7\nthe techniques used in cyber-attacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched or until well after the breach has occurred;\n\u00b7\nthe increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage;\n\u00b7\nthe vulnerability of systems to third-parties seeking to gain access to such systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems; and\n\u00b7\nour frequent transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third-parties, including our vendors and regulators, and possible weaknesses that go undetected in our data systems notwithstanding the testing we conduct of those systems.\nWhile we invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and we conduct periodic tests of our security systems and processes, we may not succeed in anticipating or adequately protecting against or preventing all security breaches and cyber-attacks from occurring. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents.\nAs is the case with non-electronic fraudulent activity, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third-parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third-parties with whom we do business. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 and/or third-parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny and result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nDuring 2018, we experienced a security incident involving the possible unauthorized access of certain personal information in the possession of the Bank. We take the privacy of personal information seriously and we took steps to address the incident promptly after it was discovered, including initiating an internal investigation into the incident and working with an independent forensic investigation firm to assist us in the investigation of and response to the incident. We also reported the incident to law enforcement authorities. Based on the report of the independent forensic investigation firm, we believe that a phishing incident occurred where certain emails and attachments from two employee email accounts may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. We believe that these email accounts contained certain personal information for approximately 7,800 individuals. Although our investigation has not found any evidence that the incident involved any unauthorized access to or use of any of the Bank\u2019s internal computer systems or network, and we believe that the access was limited to information that was contained in the email accounts of the two employees, we may become subject to claims in the future for purportedly fraudulent transactions or other matters arising out of the breach of information stored in the affected email accounts. Additionally, the incident may have a negative impact on our reputation if we become subject to claims in the future, and reputational harm arising out of such claims or litigation may cause our customers to lose confidence in our ability to safeguard their information.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change.\nThe financial services industry has undergone rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could impair our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third-parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third-parties). For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third-parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third-parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. There are various state and federal data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all our clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third-parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third-parties), we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers for our products and services and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely impact by employee errors and customer or employee fraud.\nBecause we are a financial institution, employee errors and employee or customer misconduct could cause financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information, each of which can be particularly damaging for financial institutions. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud, as well as insurance coverage designed to protect us from material losses associated with these risks, including losses resulting from any associated business interruption. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided to us by our borrowers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to approve loans or to enter into other transactions with borrowers and counterparties, we rely on information furnished to us by, or on behalf of, borrowers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We also rely on representations of borrowers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected and we may be subject to regulatory action. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, another third-party, or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Our controls and processes may not have detected, or may not\ndetect all, misrepresented information in our loan originations or from our business clients. Any such misrepresented information could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the real properties we own and the foreclosure on real estate assets securing our loan portfolio.\nWe may purchase real estate in connection with our acquisition and expansion efforts, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate or otherwise be deemed to be in control of property that serves as collateral on loans we make. We could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third-parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third-parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. The cost of removal or abatement may substantially exceed the value of the affected properties or the loans secured by those properties, we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owners or other responsible parties and we may not be able to resell the affected properties either before or after completion of any such removal or abatement procedures.\nWe could be adversely impacted by natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophes.\nWe operate banking locations throughout Houston and Beaumont areas, which are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms, other adverse weather conditions, pandemics and other catastrophes. In addition, man-made events such as acts of terror and governmental responses to acts of terror, malfunctions of the electronic grid and other infrastructure breakdowns, could adversely affect economic conditions in our markets. These adverse weather and catastrophic events can disrupt our operations, cause widespread and extensive property damage, force the relocation of residents and significantly disrupt economic activity in the region, significantly depress the local economies in which we operate and adversely affect our customers. If the economies in our markets experience an overall decline because of a catastrophic event, demand for loans and our other products and services could decline. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on our loan portfolios may increase substantially after events such as hurricanes, as uninsured property losses, interruptions of our customers\u2019 operations or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures our loans could be materially and adversely affected by a catastrophic event.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property in addition to other litigation in the ordinary course of business.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as our company, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support their day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We also use trademarks and logos for marketing purposes, and third-parties may allege that our marketing, processes or systems may infringe their intellectual property rights. Competitors of our vendors, or other individuals or companies, may from time to time claim to hold intellectual property sold to us by our vendors. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nThese licenses may also significantly increase our operating expense. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against us or settled, we could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, we may have to engage in protracted litigation that can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If we are found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party.\nIn addition to litigation relating to intellectual property, we are regularly involved in litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that these litigation matters should not have a material adverse impact on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects, we may be unable to successfully defend or resolve any current or future litigation matters.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangibles may become impaired.\nWe review goodwill and other intangibles for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of these assets might be impaired. While we have not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangibles, there can be no assurance that our future evaluations of our existing goodwill and intangibles or such assets we may acquire in the future will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment.\nBanking is highly regulated under federal and state law. As such, we are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the overall financial stability of the U.S. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than GAAP would require. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional operating costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, enforcement actions and fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, regulatory capital levels and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law and there remains uncertainty around the impact of the law and the implementation and regulations pursuant to the law. The Trump administration issued an executive order calling for a full review of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated under it. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, require the development of new compliance infrastructure, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with any supervisory actions.\nAs part of the bank regulatory process, the OCC and the Federal Reserve periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If one of these federal banking agencies were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, asset sensitivity, risk management or other aspects of any of our operations have become unsatisfactory, or that our Company, the Bank or their respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital levels, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, the Bank or their respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance. Becoming subject to such regulatory actions could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements.\nThe federal banking agencies published new capital rules, referred to herein as the Basel III capital rules, which apply to all bank holding companies with $3.0 billion or more in consolidated assets and all banks regardless of size. Under the Basel III capital rules, we are required to maintain certain minimum capital levels. Our inability to comply with these capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, limit our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends and discretionary bonuses or result in regulatory actions, any of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nWe intend to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses and expansion of the Bank\u2019s banking location network, or de novo branching. Generally, we must receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a depository institution or related business insured by the FDIC, or before we open a de novo branch. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the impact of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, our future prospects and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the CRA and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities). Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell banking locations as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action related to anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. FinCEN, established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to administer the BSA, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and frequently coordinates enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by OFAC.\nTo comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have dedicated significant resources to our anti-money laundering program. If our policies, procedures, systems and practices are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines, regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the inability to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plans, including acquisitions and de novo branching, and criminal sanctions.\nThe Bank is the subject of an investigation by FinCEN regarding the Bank\u2019s compliance with the BSA and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\nThe Bank is the subject of an investigation by FinCEN and the Bank is cooperating with this investigation. The Bank has incurred material fees and expenses regarding with this matter and may continue to incur material fees and expenses regarding this matter at least through the completion of FinCEN\u2019s investigation. Additionally, the Bank could be subject to additional liability or restrictions on its operations in the event the investigation results in some type of finding of a deficiency in its program that results in an enforcement action or civil money penalty which could have a material adverse impact on us and our operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. The CFPB was created under the\nDodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial laws with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The ongoing broad rulemaking powers of the CFPB have potential to have a significant impact on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services. The CFPB has indicated that it may propose new rules on overdrafts and other consumer financial products or services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations if any such rules limit our ability to provide such financial products or services.\nA successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, fair lending laws or regulations, or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties can also challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of and transactions with such persons and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Through our Company and the Bank and our agents and employees, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we may operate. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. Failure to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nFederal, state and local regulations and/or the licensing of loan servicing, collections and our sales of loans to third-parties may increase the cost of compliance and the risks of noncompliance and subject us to litigation.\nWe service some of our own loans and loan servicing is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on those activities. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations has increased in recent years and, in addition, some individual municipalities have begun to enact laws that restrict loan servicing activities, including delaying or temporarily preventing foreclosures or forcing the modification of certain mortgages. If regulators impose new or more restrictive requirements, we may incur additional significant costs to comply with such requirements, which may further adversely affect us. In addition, if we were subject to regulatory investigation or regulatory action regarding our loan modification and foreclosure practices, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, we have sold loans to third-parties. In these sales, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in a requirement that we repurchase the loans, or otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties. These aspects of our business or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could possibly lead to civil and criminal liability; loss of licensure; damage to our reputation in the industry; fines and penalties and litigation, including class action lawsuits; and administrative enforcement actions.\nPotential limitations on incentive compensation contained in proposed federal agency rulemaking may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain our highest performing employees.\nIn April 2011 and May 2016, the Federal Reserve, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published proposed rules designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more in assets, such as the Bank. It cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will substantially affect the way we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. Depending on the nature and application of the final rules, we may not be able to successfully compete with certain financial institutions and other companies that are not subject to some or all the rules to retain and attract executives and other high performing employees. If this were to occur, relationships that we have established with our clients may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums could adversely impact our earnings and results of operations.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. In 2010, the FDIC increased the Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s target reserve ratio to 2.0% of insured deposits following the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s elimination of the 1.5% cap on the insurance fund\u2019s reserve ratio and the FDIC is required to put in place a restoration plan should the Deposit Insurance Fund fall below its 1.35% minimum reserve ratio. If the Deposit Insurance Fund falls below its minimum reserve ratio or fails to meet its funding requirements, special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. Further, if there are additional financial institution failures that affect the Deposit Insurance Fund, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine that was codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank at times when the bank holding company may not be inclined to do so and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Accordingly, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at a time when our resources are limited, and we may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital to make the required capital injection. Any loan by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank is subordinate in right with payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing by a bank holding company to make a capital injection to a subsidiary bank often becomes more difficult and expensive relative to other corporate borrowings.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client.\nIn addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due.\nWe could be adversely impacted by monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the U.S. money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of securities by the Federal Reserve, adjustments of both the discount rate and the federal funds rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant impact on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Although we cannot determine the effects of such policies on us, such policies could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators that impacts our operations and capital requirements.\nThe OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors, (1) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family and nonfarm nonresidential properties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital.\nThe focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us or that may result in a curtailment of our commercial real estate lending and/or the requirement that we maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, either of which would adversely impact our loan originations and profitability.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may affect the market price and trading volume of our common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u00b7\nchanges in economic or business conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u00b7\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nadditional or anticipated sales of our common stock or other securities by us or our existing shareholders;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors or us, including the perception that investment in Texas is unattractive or less attractive during periods of low oil prices;\n\u00b7\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us;\n\u00b7\nother economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and\n\u00b7\nother news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our primary markets or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market and especially the market for financial institution stocks have experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in many cases have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our shareholders.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time, including as consideration in future acquisitions or under compensation or incentive plan. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. We may grant registration rights covering shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with acquisitions and investments.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nAs a public company, our legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses are substantial. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB and the Nasdaq, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, compliance with these reporting requirements and other SEC and Nasdaq rules has made certain operating activities more time-consuming. Further, our reporting burden will increase when we no longer qualify for the scaled disclosure allowed us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. We could cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as soon as the end of the 2020 fiscal year. When these exemptions cease to apply, we will likely incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward compliance.\nOur management and Board of Directors have significant control over our business.\nOur directors and named executive officers beneficially owned approximately 29.3% of our outstanding common stock as a group at December 31, 2019. Consequently, our management and Board of Directors may be able to significantly affect our affairs and policies, including the outcome of the election of directors and the potential outcome of other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all our assets and other extraordinary corporate matters. This influence may also have the effect of delaying or preventing changes of control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our Company. The interests of these insiders could conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.\nThe holders of our debt obligations have priority over our common stock with respect to payment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up and with respect to the payment of interest.\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, our common stock would rank below all claims of debt holders against us. Our debt obligations are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on our debt obligations before any dividends can be paid on our common stock. In the event of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our debt obligations must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. To the extent that we issue additional debt obligations they will be of equal rank with, or senior to, our existing debt obligations and senior to our shares of common stock.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future.\nOur certificate of formation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price and materially adversely impact the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe are dependent upon the Bank for cash flow and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted.\nOur primary tangible asset is the stock of the Bank. As such, we depend upon the Bank for cash distributions that we use to pay our operating expenses, satisfy our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. Federal statutes, regulations and policies restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to us. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, the OCC can restrict the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends by supervisory action. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we will not be able to satisfy our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nAlthough we have historically paid dividends to our shareholders, we have no obligation to continue doing so and may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to holders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs and other factors, we have made and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends paid to holders of our common stock.\nWe are also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve requiring that we inform and consult with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in an adverse change to our capital structure, including interest on our other debt obligations. If required payments on our other debt obligations are not made or are deferred, or dividends on any preferred stock we may issue are not paid, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.\nIn addition, our ability to declare or pay dividends is also subject to the terms of our loan agreement, which prohibits us from declaring or paying dividends upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. See \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 11.\u201d\nOur corporate organizational documents and provisions of federal and state law to which we are subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect.\nOur certificate of formation and our bylaws (each as amended and restated) may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control or a replacement of our incumbent Board of Directors or management. Our governing documents include provisions that:\n\u00b7\nempower our Board of Directors, without shareholder approval, to issue our preferred stock, the terms of which, including voting power, are to be set by our Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, with directors of each class serving a three-year term upon completion of a phase-in period;\n\u00b7\nprovide that directors may only be removed from office for cause and only upon a majority shareholder vote;\n\u00b7\neliminate cumulative voting in elections of directors;\n\u00b7\npermit our Board of Directors to alter, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or to adopt new bylaws;\n\u00b7\nrequire the request of holders of at least 50.0% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at a meeting to call a special shareholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u00b7\nprohibit shareholder action by less than unanimous written consent, thereby requiring virtually all actions to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders;\n\u00b7\nrequire shareholders that wish to bring business before annual or special meetings of shareholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of shareholders, to provide timely notice of their intent in writing; and\n\u00b7\nenable our Board of Directors to increase, between annual meetings, the number of persons serving as directors and to fill the vacancies created as a result of the increase by a majority vote of the directors present at a meeting of directors.\nIn addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control. Furthermore, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company. These laws include the BHC Act and the CIBC Act. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nFurthermore, our bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located in Jefferson County, Texas, the county in which Beaumont is located, will be the exclusive forum for: (a) any actual or purported derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty by any of our directors or officers; (c) any action asserting a claim against us or our directors or officers arising pursuant to the Texas Business Organizations Code, our certificate of formation, or our bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim against us or our officers or directors that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. As a shareholder of our Company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our bylaws related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our bylaws may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 17108, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBTX"}
